        "BK channels play a crucial role in regulating the spontaneous action potential rhythmicity in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN is the primary circadian pacemaker in the brain, and it generates rhythmic electrical activity that drives the 24-hour cycle of behavioral and physiological processes. BK channels are a type of potassium channel that are highly expressed in the SCN and are involved in setting the frequency and amplitude of the spontaneous action potentials that underlie the rhythmic electrical activity of the SCN.\n\nIn mice lacking BK channels (Kcnma1(-/-) mice), there is an increase in arrhythmicity and a change in the amplitude and period of rhythmic activity in the SCN. This suggests that BK channels are important for maintaining the regularity and stability of the spontaneous action potential rhythmicity in the SCN. Additionally, Kcnma1(-/-) SCNs show increased variability in the timing of the daily SFR peak, which further supports the idea that BK channels play a critical role in regulating the circadian rhythm in the SCN.",

Fibrocytes are a population of mesenchymal progenitor cells that can differentiate into various cell types, including fibroblasts and myofibroblasts. In asthma, airway smooth muscle hyperplasia is a hallmark feature that is associated with disease severity and persistent airflow obstruction. The study suggests that fibrocytes may be recruited to the airway smooth muscle compartment in asthma, where they could contribute to the development of airway smooth muscle hyperplasia.",

The tasks were selected to assess visual-perceptual, visual-spatial, working memory, and inhibition domains. The results suggest that individuals with Down syndrome (DS) were relatively impaired on visual-perceptual and visual-spatial reversal learning tasks but showed strengths in egocentric spatial learning and object discrimination tasks. In contrast, individuals with Fragile X syndrome (FXS) were relatively impaired on object discrimination learning and reversal tasks but exhibited strengths in egocentric spatial learning and reversal tasks as well as on an object recognition memory task. Both ID groups demonstrated relatively poor performance for a visual-spatial working memory task.",

        "The cytokine milieu can modulate the release of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) from human keratinocytes stimulated with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). The addition of IL-4, IL-13, and/or TNF-alpha enhances the release of TSLP, while IFN-alpha and IFN-beta upregulate it further. In contrast, IFN-gamma, TGF-beta, or IL-17 suppress the release of TSLP.",
        "The mTOR pathway plays a crucial role in regulating vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) differentiation from human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal progenitors (hBMDMPs). The mTOR pathway is activated by growth factors and nutrients, and it regulates cell growth, proliferation, and survival. In the context of VSMC differentiation, mTOR signaling promotes the expression of VSMC-specific genes and inhibits the expression of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) markers. This process is mediated by the phosphorylation of key transcription factors and the regulation of gene expression. Additionally, mTOR signaling plays a role in the regulation of cell cycle progression and the control of cell proliferation. Overall, the mTOR pathway is essential for the proper differentiation of hBMDMPs into VSMCs.",

        "The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) forms the outer blood-retinal barrier. It is unclear how culture conditions might alter barrier properties of isolated RPE. We examined whether retinal secretions that increase the barrier functions of tight junctions in vitro also make gene expression in general more in vivo-like.\n\nChick RPE from embryonic day 7 (E7) and E14 were cultured on filters. Media conditioned by organ culture of E14 neural retinas was added to the apical medium chamber. RNA was isolated to probe the chick genome on Affymetrix microarrays, and expression was compared to native E14 RPE. Expression was further analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry.\n\nMore than 86% of the genes expressed in vivo were expressed in basal culture conditions, including RPE-specific markers such as RPE65 and bestrophin. E14 retinal conditioned medium affected 15% of the transcriptome in E7 cultures (24% if serum was included), but only 1.9% in E14 cultures (12% with serum). Examination of 610 genes important for RPE function revealed that mRNAs for 17% were regulated by retinal conditioned medium alone in E7 cultures, compared to 6.2% for E14. For tight junctions, retinal conditioned medium had the most effect on members of the claudin family. Besides regulating mRNA levels, immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry suggested additional mechanisms whereby retinal secretions regulated protein expression and localization.",

        "Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a molecular chaperone that plays a crucial role in the folding and stability of many proteins involved in cell growth and survival. Inhibition of Hsp90 has been shown to disrupt the function of these proteins, leading to cell death in cancer cells. One of the mechanisms by which Hsp90 inhibition affects hepatocellular cancer growth is by disrupting the cell cycle. Specifically, Hsp90 inhibition leads to the degradation of the G2/M checkpoint protein cdc2, which is essential for the progression of cells from the G2 phase to mitosis. This disruption of the cell cycle leads to cell death in cancer cells. Additionally, Hsp90 inhibition has been shown to affect the expression of genes involved in cell growth and survival, further contributing to the anti-cancer effects of Hsp90 inhibitors.",

        "In trypanosomes, functionally related transcripts tend to share common RNA motifs for specific RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). These RBPs play a crucial role in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression by modulating mRNA stability and translational efficiency. The shared RNA motifs allow RBPs to recognize and bind to multiple transcripts, thereby regulating the expression of functionally related genes in a coordinated manner. This finding suggests that RBPs play a critical role in the coordination of gene expression in trypanosomes.",

In a rat model of obstructive nephropathy, PTX treatment reduced fibrosis scores and inhibited the expression of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGFbeta1), a key cytokine in tubulointerstitial fibrogenesis. Meanwhile, VEGF protein and mRNA in the kidney were increased in the PTX-treated group compared with the control group. PTX up-regulated expression of VEGF mRNA in a dose- and time-dependent manner in cultured HK-2 cells. However, expression of HIF-1alpha was unchanged by PTX treatment. PTX prolonged the half-life of VEGF mRNA by a 1.07-fold increase.",
        "Proximal splenic angioembolization (SAE) has been introduced as an alternative to splenectomy in the management of blunt splenic injuries in hemodynamically stable patients. However, the appropriateness of SAE and its utility in this setting remains under debate. This study compared the outcomes of proximal SAE as part of a management algorithm for adult traumatic splenic injury with splenectomy in hemodynamically stable patients with isolated splenic injury and computed tomographic (CT) evidence of active contrast extravasation. The study found that the incidence of Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) was higher in those patients that underwent proximal SAE compared with those that underwent splenectomy. Additionally, the study found that the failure rate of nonoperative management (NOM) after SAE was directly related to the grade of splenic organ injury. These findings suggest that further research is needed to determine the optimal management strategy for blunt splenic injuries in hemodynamically stable patients.",

In contrast, in a control group of 23 untreated patients with persistently normal serum alanine aminotransferase and detectable serum HCV-RNA, HCV antibody levels remained unchanged over a median follow-up of 5 years. These findings suggest that SVR is associated with clearance of HCV RNA and a decrease in HCV antibody levels, particularly against non-structural proteins, in patients treated with interferon therapy.",

        "Crohn\"s disease (CD) is highly heritable. NOD2 has emerged as the main susceptibility gene among individuals of European ancestry; however, NOD2 does not appear to contribute to CD susceptibility among many non-European populations. Today\"s African American (AA) population represents an admixture of West African (80%) and European (20%) ancestry. Since genotype-based tools are becoming increasingly available for CD, it is important that we validate the risk variants in different populations, such as admixed AAs.\n\nWe analyzed the NOD2 variants among admixed AAs (n = 321, 240 with CD and 111 healthy controls [HCs]) and nonadmixed West Africans (n = 40) by genotyping four known disease-causing NOD variants. We extracted the publicly available 1000 Genomes data on NOD2 variants from 500 subjects of West African origin. Association with disease was evaluated by logistic regression.\n\nAn association with CD was found for the classical single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 1007fs (2.6% CD, 0% HC, P = 0.012); there was no association when the genotypic and allelic frequencies of the risk alleles were compared for SNPs R702W and G908R. No known NOD2 risk alleles were seen in either the West African cohort or in subjects of African ancestry from the 1000 Genomes project.",
        "To determine whether superior vena cava (SVC) stent implantation is superior to balloon angioplasty for relieving SVC stenosis.\n\nSVC stent and balloon dilation have been used as treatment for SVC stenosis. Although safe and effective, outcome data comparing the two methods are limited.\n\nA Pediatric Cardiac Care Consortium review identified SVC stenosis. Patients who required SVC intervention were divided into two subgroups-balloon dilation (Group A) and stent implantation (Group B). Logistic regression and the log-rank test were used to test the need for re-intervention within 6 months after the initial procedure.\n\nSVC intervention was performed on 210/637 patients with SVC stenosis (33%). There were 108/210 (51%) patients with balloon dilation (Group A) and 102/210 (49%) with stent implantation (Group B). Re-intervention within 6 months of the initial intervention was more common in Group A compared to Group B [Group A = 31/40 (77.5%); Group B = 5/22 (22.7%)]. The odds-ratio for re-intervention within 6 months of the initial procedure for balloon vs. stent, is 7.3 [95% CI: (2.91, 22.3), P < 0.0001]. In addition, during the first 6 months after an intervention for SVC stenosis the proportion of patients with stent implantation that remained free of re-intervention was significantly higher than after balloon angioplasty (log-rank test, P < 0.0001). Neither age nor weight was significantly associated with the need for re-intervention.",
        "Chromosomal translocations are usually analyzed as a single entity, and are associated with a poor outcome in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Translocations involving immunoglobulin genes are recurrent, but uncommon (<5%), and their individual prognosis is not clear. The two most frequent partners are BCL2 (18q21) and BCL3 (19q13).\n\nHerein, 75 cases are reported of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and t(14;18) (BCL2-CLLs). Our series benefits from morphological, immunological and cytogenetical reviews. The IGHV status analyses were performed by referring laboratories. Comparison was made with our previously published series of chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with t(14;19) (BCL3-CLLs, n=29).\n\nCompared with BCL3-CLLs, lymphocytosis was lower in BCL2-CLLs (p<0.008), and splenomegaly was less frequent (p<0.0001). There were more \"typical\" morphologies (p<0.005) and Matutes scores >4 (p<0.001) in the BCL2-CLLs group, and less CD38 expression (p<0.04). More variant BCL2-translocations were observed (t(18;22), n=11; 2t(2;18), n=2; p<0.02), and BCL2-translocation was frequently single (p<0.002). Complex karyotypes (p<0.02), trisomy 12 (p<0.03), 6q deletion (p<0.002) and TP53 deletion (p<0.02) were less frequent in BCL2-CLLs, whereas 13q deletion was more frequent (p<0.005). The IGHV gene was frequently mutated in BCL2-CLLs (p<0.0001). Treatment-free survival was longer in BCL2-CLLs (p<0.0001).",
        "CEACAM3 is a granulocyte receptor mediating the opsonin-independent recognition and phagocytosis of human-restricted CEACAM-binding bacteria. CEACAM3 function depends on an intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-like sequence that is tyrosine phosphorylated by Src family kinases upon receptor engagement. The phosphorylated ITAM-like sequence triggers GTP-loading of Rac by directly associating with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Vav. Rac stimulation in turn is critical for actin cytoskeleton rearrangements that generate lamellipodial protrusions and lead to bacterial uptake.\n\nIn our present study we provide biochemical and microscopic evidence that the adaptor proteins Nck1 and Nck2, but not CrkL, Grb2 or SLP-76, bind to tyrosine phosphorylated CEACAM3. The association is phosphorylation-dependent and requires the Nck SH2 domain. Overexpression of the isolated Nck1 SH2 domain, RNAi-mediated knock-down of Nck1, or genetic deletion of Nck1 and Nck2 interfere with CEACAM3-mediated bacterial internalization and with the formation of lamellipodial protrusions. Nck is constitutively associated with WAVE2 and directs the actin nucleation promoting WAVE complex to tyrosine phosphorylated CEACAM3. In turn, dominant-negative WAVE2 as well as shRNA-mediated knock-down of WAVE2 or the WAVE-complex component Nap1 reduce internalization of bacteria.",
        "Ginkgo biloba (Ginkgoaceae) is one of the most ancient living seed plants and is regarded as a living fossil. G. biloba has a broad spectrum of resistance or tolerance to many pathogens and herbivores because of the presence of toxic leaf compounds. Little is known about early and late events occurring in G. biloba upon herbivory. The aim of this study was to assess whether herbivory by the generalist Spodoptera littoralis was able to induce early signaling and direct defense in G. biloba by evaluating early and late responses.\n\nEarly and late responses in mechanically wounded leaves and in leaves damaged by S. littoralis included plasma transmembrane potential (Vm) variations, time-course changes in both cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](cyt)) and H(2)O(2) production, the regulation of genes correlated to terpenoid and flavonoid biosynthesis, the induction of direct defense compounds, and the release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The results show that G. biloba responded to hebivory with a significant Vm depolarization which was associated to significant increases in both [Ca(2+)](cyt) and H(2)O(2). Several defense genes were regulated by herbivory, including those coding for ROS scavenging enzymes and the synthesis of terpenoids and flavonoids. Metabolomic analyses revealed the herbivore-induced production of several flavonoids and VOCs. Surprisingly, no significant induction by herbivory was found for two of the most characteristic G. biloba classes of bioactive compounds; ginkgolides and bilobalides.",
        "Colorectal cancer is one of the deadliest diseases in Western countries. To predict the outcome of therapy, we assessed the role of class III (TUBB3) and class V \u03b2-tubulin (TUBB6) as predictive biomarkers.\n\nUsing immunohistochemistry and nanofluidics, the expression of TUBB3 and TUBB6 was assessed in two cohorts of 180 and 134 patients, respectively. The CYP17A1 RS743572 was genotyped to identify GG carriers with enhanced androgen levels. TUBB3 and TUBB6 were investigated in 22 colorectal cancer cell lines in basal conditions and after serum starvation, the latter serving as activator of this prosurvival pathway. To ascertain the role of androgen receptor (AR) in such regulation, we silenced AR and checked TUBB3 and TUBB6 expression and sensitivity to chemotherapy.\n\nThere was a link between poor survival, the expression of TUBB3/TUBB6, and AR only in females. Conversely, only in males carriers of the GG phenotype exhibited the worst outcome. Importantly, male cell lines were resistant to serum starvation and exhibited higher levels of TUBB6, thereby suggesting that the pathway is activated by androgens. In female cells this phenomenon was absent. In both genders, AR was the main driver of TUBB3/TUBB6 expression, as constitutive silencing of AR was associated with downregulation of TUBB3/TUBB6 expression and increased sensitivity to oxaliplatin and SN-38.",
        "Antiretroviral therapy (ART)-controlled HIV-infected patients have elevated levels of systemic inflammatory markers, C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin (IL)-6, which correlate with increased cardiovascular risk and/or mortality. Persistent low-level viral replication could be involved in this inflammatory state. We evaluated whether residual viral load (VL) correlated with the level of systemic inflammatory/immune markers in ART-controlled HIV-infected patients.\n\nWe evaluated 122 antiretroviral-controlled patients with VL 1-500 copies/ml for circulating levels of high-sensitivity (hs)CRP, hsIL-6, IL-8, soluble (s)CD14 and soluble tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptors, sTNFR1 and sTNFR2.\n\nThe patients were 80.3% men, the median age was 47 years, the median CD4(+) T-cell count was 519 cells/mm(3), the median nadir CD4(+) T-cell count was 180 cells/mm(3), the median VL was 28 copies/ml and the median body mass index was 23.3 kg/m(2). The median (range) values for IL-6, CRP, IL-8, sCD14, sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 were 0.685 pg/ml (0.15-5.46), 1.8 mg/l (0.2-9.7), 10.0 pg/ml (1.6-71.1), 1,174 ng/ml (214-3,145), 1,112 pg/ml (583-5,834) and 2,412 pg/ml (1,142-7,688), respectively. IL-6 values correlated positively with HIV VL (rho=0.217, P=0.017). The VL threshold value for significantly increased IL-6 was 31 copies/ml (P=0.023). IL-6 values correlated with markers of immune dysfunction: the CD4/CD8 ratio (rho=-0.248, P=0.011), CD4 nadir level (rho=-0.186, P=0.04) and nadir CD4/CD8 ratio (rho=-0.257, P=0.008). They negatively correlated with markers of immune activation sCD14 (rho=-0.236, P=0.011) and IL-8 (rho=-0.290, P=0.002). We found no correlation between VL and CRP or other markers of inflammation/immune dysfunction including sTNFR1, sTNFR2, sCD14 and IL-8.",
        "Network motifs, recurring subnetwork patterns, provide significant insight into the biological networks which are believed to govern cellular processes.\n\nWe present a comparative network motif experimental approach, which helps to explain complex biological phenomena and increases the understanding of biological functions at the molecular level by exploring evolutionary design principles of network motifs.\n\nUsing this framework to analyze the SM (Sec1/Munc18)-SNARE (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor activating protein receptor) system in exocytic membrane fusion in yeast and neurons, we find that the SM-SNARE network motifs of yeast and neurons show distinct dynamical behaviors. We identify the closed binding mode of neuronal SM (Munc18-1) and SNARE (syntaxin-1) as the key factor leading to mechanistic divergence of membrane fusion systems in yeast and neurons. We also predict that it underlies the conflicting observations in SM overexpression experiments. Furthermore, hypothesis-driven lipid mixing assays validated the prediction.",
        "Bilobar colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) are often considered incurable or associated with poor prognosis even after R0 resection. In this single-center study, we evaluate the impact of CRLM spreading on recurrence-free survival (RFS) and cancer-specific overall survival (CSS) after R0 resection of CRLM with respect to multimodal treatment strategies including perioperative chemotherapy and multistep resections.\n\nBetween January 2001 and December 2010, R0 resection could be achieved in 70 patients with bilobar and 100 with unilobar CRLM. Extent of disease, perioperative chemotherapy, surgical procedures, adjuvant treatment, histopathological workup, RFS, and CSS were compared between both cohorts.\n\nForty-six (66\\xa0%) patients with bilobar and 26 (26\\xa0%) patients with unilobar CRLM received preoperative chemotherapy (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). For bilobar CRLM, more extended and multistep resection including portal vein occlusion were performed (29\\xa0% versus 3\\xa0%; p\\u2009<\\u20090.001).

        "There is increasing evidence demonstrating an association between fracture epidemiology and socioeconomic status. However, the influence of socioeconomic deprivation on fracture outcome has not been documented before. The aim of this study was to determine if socioeconomic deprivation influenced the short-term outcome following a fracture of the radial head or neck.\n\nWe identified from a prospective database all patients who sustained a radial head or neck fracture over an 18-month period. The primary outcome measure for this study was the patient-reported short musculoskeletal function assessment (SMFA). The Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) was used to quantify deprivation, and any correlation with functional outcome was determined. Multivariate regression analysis was used to determine the influence of deprivation on outcome once other significant demographic and fracture characteristics had been accounted for.\n\nThere were 200 patients in the study cohort, of which 107 (53.5%) were female and the mean age was 44 years (16-83). At a mean follow-up of 6 months the median SMFA score was 0.54 (0-55.4). The SMFA was found to be influenced by the IMD, with increasing deprivation associated with a poorer outcome (p=0.006). On multivariate analysis, the AO fracture classification, compensation and increasing deprivation were the only independent predictors of outcome (all p<0.05).",
        "Phaeochromocytomas (PHEO) and functional paragangliomas (PGLs) are catecholamine-secreting neuroendocrine tumours. Although most PHEO/PGLs are benign, 10-35% present as (or develop into) malignant tumours with a poor prognosis. Overexpression of ERBB2 (v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukaemia viral oncogene homologue 2) has been reported to be associated with malignant PHEO. We used gene expression profiling of PHEO/PGLs to gain a better understanding of the tumourigenic pathways associated with ERBB2.\n\nWe used the Affymetrix Gene Chip U133 Plus 2\u00b70 genome-wide gene expression cDNA microarray of 18 PHEO/PGLs (12 benign and six malignant, divided into two groups depending on ERBB2 expression levels) to analyse the gene expression patterns.\n\nUnsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis of transcription profiles of 18 samples identified two dominant expression clusters corresponding to samples belonging to the ERBB2+ and ERBB2- groups. According to the gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) databases, the differentially expressed genes were classified into diverse functional categories and signalling pathways. In particular, the focal adhesion signalling pathway showed significant differences between the groups; specifically, the FAK-Src-MAPK pathway was prominently activated in the ERBB2+ group.",
        "The planned clinical activity of pediatric urologists has been well described. However, little is known about nonscheduled work (eg consultation requests). We describe the unplanned clinical activity of pediatric urologists at a high volume academic medical center.\n\nDemographic data regarding inpatient, operating room and emergency department pediatric urology consults were prospectively entered into an internal database. Consults from July 2008 through June 2010 underwent retrospective chart abstraction to identify reasons for consultation. Bivariate and multivariate statistics were used to evaluate 1) temporal trends in unplanned clinical activity, and 2) patient and service specific factors associated with whether a consult was billable (ie seen by attending physician within 24 hours).\n\nDuring the study period 665 pediatric consults were obtained. Mean \u00b1 SD patient age was 8.4 \u00b1 7.7 years. Nearly all consults were seen at the emergency department (51%) or the inpatient wards (47%). The most common primary diagnoses were infection, obstruction/hydronephrosis and neurogenic bladder. The number of consults per month decreased during the course of the academic year (r(2) = 0.1422). Nearly three fourths of consults were eligible for billing. The factors associated with consult eligibility for billing included specific attending physician (p = 0.03), location (p <0.0001) and house officer experience (p = 0.007).",

We used multiple linear regression to identify variables independently associated with 12-week SRF.\n\nHospital and patients\" homes. The intervention was via phone calls.\n\nPeople with a new stroke recruited during the inpatient stay (N=371, depressed only n=176).

        "Progressive hepatocarcinogenesis is a stepwise process that drives liver transformation. However, the molecular mechanisms of early liver transformation are far from clear. A role for microRNAs (miRNA) as diagnostic and prognostic factors in human tumours, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is promising. We aimed to identify novel miRNA as biomarkers for differential diagnosis and predictors of disease progression.\n\nWe used a low-density array platform to profile the expression of 664 mature miRNA in a cohort of 60 hepatitis C virus-positive liver lesions representative of all stages of progressive hepatocarcinogenesis. We validated selected miRNA in two independent patient series by qPCR and we characterized the genomic status of the miRNA cluster C19MC by fluorescent in situ hybridization and copy-number variation analyses.\n\nA 18-miRNA signature distinguished cirrhosis, dysplastic nodules and HCC lesions. Four miRNAs overexpressed in HCCs belonged to chromosome 19 miRNA cluster (C19MC). Significant overexpression of C19MC in early HCC compared to dysplastic nodules could be confirmed in a second series of hepatitis B virus-related liver lesions (n\\xa0=\\xa030). In a third series of 61 HCCs, C19MC cluster was overexpressed in HCCs compared to matched cirrhotic parenchyma and regardless of the type of viral infection. High C19MC miRNA levels were correlated with poor clinico-pathological features, increased risk of tumour recurrence and shorter overall survival time. HCCs overexpressing the C19MC cluster showed genetic amplification of the corresponding locus.",

This study sought to evaluate plasma DAO activities during adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with gastric cancer.\n\nWe investigated 20 patients with gastric cancer who were treated with oral fluorouracil anti-cancer drugs as adjuvant chemotherapy. Plasma DAO activity was measured in all patients before chemotherapy and at 2, 4 and 6 weeks after the start of chemotherapy, and quality of life was evaluated simultaneously.\n\nThe median DAO activity after 4 weeks of chemotherapy was significantly decreased compared to the pre-chemotherapy levels (6.6 vs. 7.5 U/l; p = 0.038). The changes in the rate of DAO activity at 2 and 6 weeks following the start of chemotherapy in patients with gastrointestinal tract toxicity were significantly lower than in those without toxicity (p =0.021 and 0.047, respectively). The patient cohort showed a slightly positive correlation between DAO activity and global health status and a negative correlation between DAO activity and appetite loss.",
        "Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) offer a large range of applications in life sciences. Applications in neurosciences are one focus of interest. Unfortunately, not all groups have access to nanoparticles or the possibility to develop and produce them for their applications. Hence, they have to focus on commercially available particles. Little is known about the uptake of nanoparticles in primary cells. Previously studies mostly reported cellular uptake in cell lines. Here we present a systematic study on the uptake of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) by primary cells of the nervous system.\n\nWe assessed the internalization in different cell types with confocal and electron microscopy. The analysis confirmed the uptake of MNPs in the cells, probably with endocytotic mechanisms. Furthermore, we compared the uptake in PC12 cells, a rat pheochromocytoma cell line, which is often used as a neuronal cell model, with primary neuronal cells. It was found that the percentage of PC12 cells loaded with MNPs was significantly higher than for neurons. Uptake studies in primary mixed neuronal/glial cultures revealed predominant uptake of MNPs by microglia and an increase in their number. The number of astroglia and oligodendroglia which incorporated MNPs was lower and stable. Primary mixed Schwann cell/fibroblast cultures showed similar MNP uptake of both cell types, but the Schwann cell number decreased after MNP incubation. Organotypic co-cultures of spinal cord slices and peripheral nerve grafts resembled the results of the dispersed primary cell cultures.",
        "Patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) frequently report excessive belching but it is not known what determines the severity of these complaints.\n\nTo determine what causes troublesome belching symptoms in GERD patients.\n\nWe included 90 consecutive patients who were referred for ambulatory 24-h pH-impedance measurement as part of the analysis of reflux symptoms. Overall severity of belching was reported by the patients using a 3-point scale. Furthermore, each belch perceived during the ambulatory measurement was reported by the patients using a symptom diary.\n\nNo significant differences in frequency of gastric belches or combined liquid reflux and gastric belches were observed. However, the number of supragastric belches was significantly higher in patients with severe belching complaints compared to patients with moderate and none to mild complaints. Moreover, the number of supragastric belches which coincided with a liquid reflux episode was significantly higher in patients with severe complaints than in those with moderate and none to mild complaints. Per-patient analysis showed that belches coinciding with a liquid reflux event were more often symptomatic than isolated belches.",

        "Serious infections are an important side effect of immunosuppressive therapy used to treat Crohn\"s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). There have been no nationally representative studies examining the spectrum of infection related hospitalizations in patients with IBD.\n\nOur study consisted of all adult CD and UC related hospitalizations from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample 2007, a national hospitalization database in the United States. We then identified all infection-related hospitalizations through codes for either the specific infections or disease processes (sepsis, pneumonia, etc.). Predictors of infections as well as the excess morbidity associated with infections were determined using multivariate regression models.\n\nThere were an estimated 67,221 hospitalizations related to infections in IBD patients, comprising 27.5% of all IBD hospitalizations. On multivariate analysis, infections were independently associated with age, co-morbidity, malnutrition, TPN, and bowel surgery. Infection-related hospitalizations had a four-fold greater mortality (OR 4.4, 95% CI 3.7-5.2). However, this varied by type of infection with the strongest effect seen for sepsis (OR 15.3, 95% CI 12.4-18.6), pneumonia (OR 3.6, 95% CI 2.9-4.5) and C. difficile (OR 3.2, 95% CI 2.6-4.0), and weaker effects for urinary infections (OR 1.4, 95%CI 1.1-1.7).

        "Microglia are one of the main cell types to be productively infected by HIV-1 in the central nervous system (CNS). Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and cysteinyl-leukotrienes such as LTC4 are some of the proinflammatory molecules produced in infected individuals that contribute to neuroinflammation. We therefore sought to investigate the role of leukotrienes (LTs) in HIV-1 infection of microglial cells.\n\nTo evaluate the role of LTs on HIV-1 infection in the CNS, monocyte-derived microglial-like cells (MDMis) were utilized in this study. Leukotriene-treated MDMis were infected with either fully replicative brain-derived HIV-1 isolates (YU2) or R5-tropic luciferase-encoding particles in order to assess viral production and expression. The efficacy of various steps of the replication cycle was evaluated by means of p24 quantification by ELISA, luciferase activity determination and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).\n\nWe report in this study that virus replication is reduced upon treatment of MDMis with LTB4 and LTC4. Additional experiments indicate that these proinflammatory molecules alter the pH-independent entry and early post-fusion events of the viral life cycle. Indeed, LT treatment induced a diminution in integrated proviral DNA while reverse-transcribed viral products remained unaffected. Furthermore, decreased C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) surface expression was observed in LT-treated MDMis. Finally, the effect of LTs on HIV-1 infection in MDMis appears to be mediated partly via a signal transduction pathway involving protein kinase C.",
        "Multidrug resistance is one of the main impediments to the successful treatment of colon cancer. Glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) which is related to multidrug resistance (MDR) can reduce the level of ceramide and can help cells escape from the ceramide-induced cell apoptosis. However, the underlying mechanism is still unclear.\n\nThe cell proliferation and cell toxicity were measured with Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8). The mRNA levels of GCS and MDR1 were detected by semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR amplification, the protein levels of GCS, caspase-3 and P-gp proteins were indicated by Western blotting. The apoptosis rates of cells were measured with flow cytometry.\n\nThe relative mRNA levels of GCS in HCT-8, HCT-8/VCR, HCT-8/VCR- sh-mock and HCT-8/VCR-sh-GCS were 71.4 \u00b1 1.1%, 95.1 \u00b1 1.2%, 98.2 \u00b1 1.5%, and 66.6 \u00b1 2.1% respectively. The mRNA levels of MDR1 were respectively 61.3 \u00b1 1.1%, 90.5 \u00b1 1.4%, 97.6 \u00b1 2.2% and 56.1 \u00b1 1.2%.

        "The researchers investigated the relation between mindfulness and social anxiety symptoms, and examined whether this relation is mediated by cognitive appraisals commonly associated with social anxiety.\n\nNinety-eight individuals diagnosed with social phobia.\n\nUsing a cross-sectional design, ordinary least squares regression and bootstrapping mediation analyses were used to test the study hypotheses.\n\nMindfulness was negatively related to symptoms of social anxiety. This relation was partially mediated by cognitive appraisals about the likelihood and cost of a negative social outcome.",
        "The aim of the present study was to evaluate the outcomes of combined oral steroid, nasal steroid and surgical therapy in patients with impaired olfaction due to nasal polyposis.\n\nThis prospective observational study was undertaken in the otolaryngology department of a university hospital. During the study, 19 nasal polyposis patients were evaluated three times, i.e. before oral steroid therapy, before surgery (after steroid therapy) and after surgery, with smell identification tests, acoustic rhinometry, subjective smell score, endoscopic grading and a visual analog scale for nasal obstruction.\n\nAll subjective and objective measures were significantly improved after medical and surgical therapy (p < 0.01). The median smell identification score improved from 2 (interquartile range 0-4) to 5 (interquartile range 4-7) after combined therapy. Smell identification scores were found to be modestly correlated with all other examination findings.",
        "The effects of the addition of sage and garlic in chicken meat on lipid and cholesterol oxidation, having as prooxidant factors the addition of salt, thermal treatment, and frozen storage, were evaluated. The content of unsaturated fatty acids did not change in the presence of sage; on the contrary, with garlic, the content of these fatty acids decreased after cooking and storage. Hexanal and pentanal contents were lower in patties containing sage, and higher in those with garlic. The 7-ketocholesterol was the cholesterol oxide found in higher amount in raw chicken on day 0, while the formation of 7\u03b2- and 7\u03b1-hydroxycholesterol was verified only from day 30 on. Cooking and storage resulted in increase of total cholesterol oxides and decrease of \u03b1- and \u03b3-tocopherol. Sage was effective in controlling lipid and cholesterol oxidation, minimizing the prooxidant effects of salt, cooking, and storage. However, garlic presented no effect as antioxidant and accelerated lipid oxidation.",
        "Despite the introduction of mild therapeutic hypothermia into postcardiac arrest care, cerebral and myocardial injuries represent the limiting factors for survival after cardiac arrest. Administering xenon may confer an additional neuroprotective effect after successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation due to its ability to stabilize cellular calcium homeostasis via N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor antagonism.\n\nIn a porcine model, we evaluated effects of xenon treatment in addition to therapeutic hypothermia on neuropathologic and functional outcomes after cardiopulmonary resuscitation.\n\nProspective, randomized, laboratory animal study.\n\nFifteen male pigs.\n\nFollowing 10 mins of cardiac arrest and 6 mins of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, ten pigs were randomized to receive either mild therapeutic hypothermia (33\u00b0C for 16 hrs) or mild therapeutic hypothermia 1 xenon (70% for 1 hr). Five animals served as normothermic controls.\n\nGross hemodynamic variables were measured using right-heart catheterization. Neurocognitive performance was evaluated for 5 days after cardiopulmonary resuscitation using a neurologic deficit score before the brains were harvested for histopathological analysis. All animals survived the observation period in the mild therapeutic hypothermia 1 xenon group while one animal in each of the other two groups died. Mild therapeutic hypothermia 1 xenon preserved cardiac output during the induction of mild therapeutic hypothermia significantly better than did mild therapeutic hypothermia alone (4.6 6 0.6 L/min vs. 3.2 6 1.6 L/min, p # .05). Both treatment groups showed significantly fewer necrotic lesions in the cerebral cortex, caudate nucleus, putamen, and in hippocampal sectors CA1 and CA3/4. However, only the combination of mild therapeutic hypothermia and xenon resulted in reduced astrogliosis in the CA1 sector and diminished microgliosis and perivascular inflammation in the putamen. Clinically, only the mild therapeutic hypothermia 1 xenon-treated animals showed significantly improved neurologic deficit scores over time (day 1 = 59.0 6 27.0 vs. day 5 = 4.0 6 5.5, p \u00f8 .05) as well as in comparison to the untreated controls on days 3 through 5 after cardiopulmonary resuscitation.",
        "A single nucleotide polymorphism of the factor VII activating protease (FSAP), FSAP Marburg I (rs7080536) has been identified as a risk factor for venous thrombosis, but its clinical role has so far been controversial in part due to small cohort sizes. The aim of the present case-control study was to elucidate the impact of the FSAP Marburg I polymorphism (FSAP-MI) on the development of venous thromboembolic disease (VTE) with other known sequence variations, including Factor V Leiden (rs6025) and Factor II G20210A (rs1799963).\n\nThe study included 891 patients (312 male and 579 female) with a history of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) and 1283 healthy blood donors with no history of venous thromboembolic disease.\n\nWe found that besides to the well-established aforementioned sequence variations of FV and Prothrombin, the FSAP Marburg I (FSAP-MI) polymorphism was significantly associated with the development of DVTs (1.65 (1.16-2.34) OR (95% CI)) and recurrent thromboembolic events (DVT and PE) (2.13 (1.35-3.36) OR (95% CI)). Comparing patients displaying one or more events FSAP-MI was still associated with the development of recurrent thromboembolic events (1.64 (1- 2.69) OR (95% CI)).",
        "Serum phosphate concentrations have been shown to predict graft loss in prevalent, but not incident, kidney transplant populations. The reasons for this are unknown. We investigated whether serum phosphate at 6 or 12 months posttransplant was associated with graft loss in the same cohort.\n\nData were collected for 325 patients transplanted and followed up at a single center (1996-2004). The association between serum phosphate at 6 and 12 months posttransplant and graft failure was analyzed.\n\nUnivariable associations with death-censored graft failure were seen for serum phosphate at 6 and 12 months (hazard ratio [HR] 1.33; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20-1.48; P < .001, and HR 1.40; CI 1.27-1.54; P < .001). On bivariable analysis (phosphate at 6 vs 12 mo), a significant association remained for both variables and increased graft failure rate (HR 1.19; CI 1.07-1.34; P = .002, and HR 1.37; CI 1.21-1.55; P < .001). These associations persisted in multivariable models (HR 1.27; CI 1.07-1.51; P = .007, and HR 1.34; CI 1.14-1.57; P < .001 for phosphate at 6 and 12 mo).",
        "Histone modifications and DNA methylation are two major factors in epigenetic phenomenon. Unlike the histone deacetylase inhibitors, which are known to exert radiosensitizing effects, there have only been a few studies thus far concerning the role of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors as radiosensitizers. The principal objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of DNMT inhibitors on the radiosensitivity of human cancer cell lines, and to elucidate the mechanisms relevant to that process.\n\nA549 (lung cancer) and U373MG (glioblastoma) cells were exposed to radiation with or without six DNMT inhibitors (5-azacytidine, 5-aza-2\"-deoxycytidine, zebularine, hydralazine, epigallocatechin gallate, and psammaplin A) for 18 hours prior to radiation, after which cell survival was evaluated via clonogenic assays. Cell cycle and apoptosis were analyzed via flow cytometry. Expressions of DNMT1, 3A/3B, and cleaved caspase-3 were detected via Western blotting. Expression of \u03b3H2AX, a marker of radiation-induced DNA double-strand break, was examined by immunocytochemistry.\n\nPretreatment with psammaplin A, 5-aza-2\"-deoxycytidine, and zebularine radiosensitized both A549 and U373MG cells. Pretreatment with psammaplin A increased the sub-G1 fraction of A549 cells, as compared to cells exposed to radiation alone. Prolongation of \u03b3H2AX expression was observed in the cells treated with DNMT inhibitors prior to radiation as compared with those treated by radiation alone.",

Current therapies can normalise the levels of both growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF1).\n\nTo establish whether the ACM vascular changes in patients with effectively managed disease are different from those in patients with an active condition.\n\n64 ACM patients were tested for serum GH (random and during an oral glucose tolerance test) and IGF1. Ultrasonography of the right common carotid (RCC) explored structural (the carotid diameter and intima-media thickness index (IMT)) and functional (the augmentation index (AIx), elastic modulus (Ep), and local pulse wave velocity (PWV)) arterial parameters in the ACM patients (groups A and B) and an age- and sex-matched control group of 21 patients without acromegaly (group C).\n\nThe ACM patients were divided into 2 subgroups that had similar cardiovascular risk factor profiles: A (n=10, with controlled ACM), and B (n=54, with active ACM). The AIx was higher in groups A (27.7% [2.2-54.3]) and B (20.0% [ - 38.2-97.1]) than in group C (3.5% [ - 11.3-31.1]), p=0.01 and 0.002, respectively.

The rat models were then randomized into 5 groups, including a blank control group, chromium particle group, and 3 rhBMP-2 groups receiving 50, 100 or 200 \u00b5g/L slow-release rhBMP-2 in addition to chromium particles. Three weeks later, the expressions of RANKL and OPG in the air pouch was detected using Western blotting and RT-PCR, and the positively stained area for osteoclasts in the bone graft was determined with TRAP staining for drug effect assessment.\n\nRANKL and OPG expressions were found in the air pouches in all the 5 groups. RANKL and OPG protein and mRNA expressions, RANKL/OPG ratio and osteoclast staining area in the bone graft were the highest in chromium particle group (P<0.05), but were significantly decreased by treatment with the slow-release rhBMP-2 formulation (P<0.05); the measurements showed no significant differences between the blank control group and 200 \u00b5g/L rhBMP-2 group (P>0.05).",
        "To investigate the effects of early intravenous adrenaline administration on circulatory recovery, cerebral reoxygenation, and plasma catecholamine concentrations, after severe asphyxia-induced bradycardia and hypotension.\n\nOne-day-old piglets were left in apnoea until heart rate and mean arterial pressure were less than 50 min(-1) and 25 mmHg, respectively. They randomly received adrenaline, 10 \u03bcgkg(-1) (n=16) or placebo (n=15) and were resuscitated with air ventilation and, when needed, closed-chest cardiac massage (CCCM). Eight not asphyxiated animals served as time controls.\n\nCCCM was required in 13 piglets given adrenaline and in 13 given placebo. Time to return of spontaneous circulation was: 72 (66-85)s vs. 77 (64-178)s [median (quartile range)] (p=0.35). Time until cerebral regional oxygen saturation (CrSO(2)) had increased to 30% was 86 (79-152)s vs. 126 (88-309)s (p=0.30). The two groups did not differ significantly in CrSO(2), heart rate, arterial pressure, right common carotid artery blood flow, or number of survivors: 13 vs. 11 animals. Plasma concentration of adrenaline, 2.5 min after resuming ventilation, was 498 (268-868)nmoll(-1) vs. 114 (80-306)nmoll(-1) (p=0.01). Corresponding noradrenaline concentrations were 1799 (1058-4182)nmoll(-1)vs. 1385 (696-3118)nmoll(-1) (ns).

        "Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is one of the most common clinical manifestations of human brain arteriovenous malformation (BAVM). However, the hemorrhagic mechanism of BAVM is still unclear. Leptin, first discovered in obesity research, has not been systematically studied in BAVM and ICH. We investigated expression and effect of leptin on human BAVM.\n\nSpecimens were obtained from 6 BAVM patients, who had been divided into either hemorrhagic or non-hemorrhagic groups. Leptin, leptin receptor, and signal transducers and activators of transcription-3 (STAT3) were analyzed by different methods, such as gene chips, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunohistochemistry, and Western blot. Perinidal brain tissue around each BAVM served as control.\n\nGene chips and RT-PCR found transcriptional leptin raised at least 2 levels in hemorrhagic BAVM. Immunohistochemical slices also showed higher expression of leptin, leptin receptor, and STAT3 on nidus part of hemorrhagic BAVM than non-hemorrhagic ones. On Western blot analysis, hemorrhagic BAVMs had higher levels of leptin (p < 0.01).",
        "Transient outward potassium current (I(to)) is thought to be central to the pathogenesis of the Brugada syndrome (BrS). However, an I((to)) activator has not been available with which to validate this hypothesis. Here, we provide a direct test of the hypothesis using a novel I(to) activator, NS5806.\n\nIsolated canine ventricular myocytes and coronary-perfused wedge preparations were used. Whole-cell patch-clamp studies showed that NS5806 (10 microM) increased peak I(to) at +40 mV by 79 +/- 4% (24.5 +/- 2.2 to 43.6 +/- 3.4 pA/pF, n = 7) and slowed the time constant of inactivation from 12.6 +/- 3.2 to 20.3 +/- 2.9 ms (n = 7). The total charge carried by I(to) increased by 186% (from 363.9 +/- 40.0 to 1042.0 +/- 103.5 pA x ms/pF, n = 7). In ventricular wedge preparations, NS5806 increased phase 1 and notch amplitude of the action potential in the epicardium, but not in the endocardium, and accentuated the ECG J-wave, leading to the development of phase 2 re-entry and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (n = 9). Although sodium and calcium channel blockers are capable of inducing BrS only in right ventricular (RV) wedge preparations, the I(to) activator was able to induce the phenotype in wedges from both ventricles. NS5806 induced BrS in 4/6 right and 2/10 left ventricular wedge preparations.",
        "Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is an acquired syndrome characterized by the widespread activation of coagulation. This leads to failure of multiple organs in the body and finally death. Because there is no effective therapy for DIC, the clinical prognosis is poor and the mortality is high.\n\nThe animals were intravenously injected with Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 6 hours and simultaneously infected three doses of recombinant fibrinogenase II (rFII) for 2 hour. Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time (PT), platelets count, fibrinogen and fibrin-fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) were determined. The plasma levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatinine (Cr) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were detected. Liver and kidney samples were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and kidney sections were stained with phosphotungstic acid-hematoxylin.\n\nWe observed that rFII increased survival rate in LPS-induced DIC rabbits as well as heparin did. Administration of rFII as well as heparin attenuated the increased plasma levels of APTT, PT and FDP and the decreased plasma level of fibrinogen at 6 h. rFII reduced hepatic and renal damages and decreased the levels of ALT and Cr as well as heparin did. rFII also significantly reduced the increased plasma levels of TNF-alpha. rFII significantly reduced the kidney fibrin deposits with respect to LPS treated animals.",

Then, the PAS units were switched from the first to the second group. Arrest, PAS, and preliminary breath-test data were collected on 714 nighttime traffic stops over two enforcement periods.\n\nThe DUI arrest rate for the officers with and without the PAS was the same, 13%. Officers who made no arrests without the PAS benefited the most from using it. Drivers stopped for an unsafe lane change, driving over the center line, and negligent driving were arrested for DUI 35% of the time.",
        "We have described VMP1 as a new protein which expression triggers autophagy in mammalian cells. Here we show that experimental diabetes activates VMP1 expression and autophagy in pancreas beta cells as a direct response to streptozotocin (STZ).\n\nMale Wistar rats were treated with 65 mg/kg STZ and pancreas islets from untreated rats were incubated with 1 mM STZ.\n\nRT-PCR analysis shows early VMP1 induction after STZ treatment. In situ hybridization reveals VMP1 mRNA in islet beta cells. Electron microscopy shows chromatin aggregation and autophagy morphology that was confirmed by LC3 expression and LC3-VMP1 co-localization. Apoptotic cell death and the reduction of beta cell pool are evident after 24 h treatment, while VMP1 is still expressed in the remaining cells. VMP1-Beclin1 colocalization in pancreas tissue from STZ-treated rats suggests that VMP1-Beclin1 interaction is involved in the autophagic process activation during experimental diabetes. Results were confirmed using pancreas islets, showing VMP1 expression and autophagy in beta cells as a direct effect of STZ treatment.",
        "Acinetobacter baumannii is a nosocomial pathogen of increasing importance, but the pathogenic mechanism of this microorganism has not been fully explored. This study investigated the potential of A. baumannii to invade epithelial cells and determined the role of A. baumannii outer membrane protein A (AbOmpA) in interactions with epithelial cells.\n\nA. baumannii invaded epithelial cells by a zipper-like mechanism, which is associated with microfilament- and microtubule-dependent uptake mechanisms. Internalized bacteria were located in the membrane-bound vacuoles. Pretreatment of recombinant AbOmpA significantly inhibited the adherence to and invasion of A. baumannii in epithelial cells. Cell invasion of isogenic AbOmpA- mutant significantly decreased as compared with wild-type bacteria. In a murine pneumonia model, wild-type bacteria exhibited a severe lung pathology and induced a high bacterial burden in blood, whereas AbOmpA- mutant was rarely detected in blood.",

Hoechst 33432 staining and fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) were used to sort the SP cells. Verapamil, inhibitor of ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter, was added before the Hoechst 33342 inoculation to observe its influence on the SP proportion. Media with LY294002, specific inhibitor of P13K, or rapamycin, specific inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), were used to culture PANC-1 cells to observe the survival of cells. Twenty-one NOD-SCID mice were randomly divided into 7 equal groups. Four groups were inoculated subcutaneously with SP cells of the concentrations of 5x10(5), 5x10(4), 5x10(3), or 1x10(3) at the right axillary fossa and with non-SP cells at the left then Hoechst 33342 staining, flow cytometric sorting were used to detect the content of SP cells at the left axillary fossa. The other 3 groups were injected subcutaneously with non-Hoechst 33342 treated cells of the concentrations of 5x10(5), 5x10(4), 5x10(3), or 1x10(3) at the right axillary fossa and PBS at the left axillary fossa. Ten weeks later the mice were killed to undergo pathological examination.\n\nAll cell lines were found to exhibit verapamil-sensitive SP cells except BXPC-3 cells. The SP cell proportion of the PANC-1 cells was 7.84%. No SP cell was found in the cells treated with verapamil. The colony-formation ability of the SP cells was (43.7+/-3.1)%, significantly higher than those of the non-SP cells and cells without Hoechst 33342 cells [(8.3+/-1.6)% and (10.2+/-1.9)% respectively, both P=0.000]. The tumorigenic ability of the SP cells was 100 times as those of the non-SP cells and Hoechst 33342 un-treated cells. After addition of LY294002 and rapamycin the fractions of the SP cells in the in PANC-1 cells decreased from (7.60+/-0.27)% to (1.90+/-0.22)% and (1.14+/-0.20)% respectively, both P=0.000, and they preferentially inhibited the SP cells rather than non-SP cells.",
        "Serial postoperative blood lactate (BL) concentrations have been shown to predict outcome of children after congenital heart surgery (CHS), and interventions aimed at lowering lactate can improve the outcome of these children. The cumulative blood loss for diagnostic purposes, such as repetitive arterial blood sampling in the intensive care unit, contributes, especially in small children, to anemia. Techniques to limit blood loss can therefore be of use. Microdialysis is a technique to monitor tissue chemistry in various clinical settings, and we hypothesized that it may be a valuable alternative for frequent blood sampling to monitor lactate in children after CHS.\n\nFifteen children with a mean age of 40 months (range, 4-118 months) were prospectively enrolled after CHS. A CMA double lumen microdialysis catheter was inserted into the subcutaneous adipose tissue of the abdominal wall and infused with an isotone mannitol 5% solution at 1 microL/min via the inlet tubing. Microdialysate fluid was collected every hour for 48 hrs and stored at -80 degrees C for lactate determination (interstitial fluid lactate, IFL). Every hour arterial blood was taken for lactate determination. Individual profiles, correlation coefficient, and Bland-Altman analysis were used to compare BL and IFL results.\n\nThere were no complications with the microdialysis technique. All patients were discharged alive from hospital. Six hundred twenty paired samples were analyzed. Mean recovery of microdialysate fluid was 84%. Median (interquartile range) was 0.95 (0.70-1.15) mmol/L for BL and 1.13 (0.86-1.48) mmol/L for IFL (p < 0.0001). Individual profiles showed that IFL follows changes in BL in some, but not all children. With this study, we could not explain this discrepancy. The correlation between BL and IFL was poor (r = .77 (p < 0.0001) r = .59). Bland-Altman analysis confirmed the insufficient performance of the current microdialysis-based procedure compared with BL.",
        "In red blood cells, protein 4.1 (4.1R) is an 80 kDa protein that stabilizes the spectrin-actin network and anchors it to the plasma membrane through its FERM domain. While the expression pattern of 4.1R in mature red cells is relatively simple, a rather complex array of 4.1R protein isoforms varying in N-terminal extensions, internal sequences and subcellular locations has been identified in nucleated cells. Among these, 135 kDa and 80 kDa isoforms have different N-terminal extensions and are expressed either from AUG1- or AUG2-containing mRNAs, respectively. These two types of mRNAs, varying solely by presence/absence of 17 nucleotides (nt) which contain the AUG1 codon, are produced by alternative splicing of the 4.1R pre-mRNA. It is unknown whether the 699 nt region comprised between AUG1 and AUG2, kept as a 5\" untranslated region in AUG2-containing mRNAs, plays a role on 4.1R mRNA translation.\n\nBy analyzing the in vitro expression of a panel of naturally occurring 4.1R cDNAs, we observed that all AUG1/AUG2-containing cDNAs gave rise to both long, 135 kDa, and short, 80 kDa, 4.1R isoforms. More importantly, similar results were also observed in cells transfected with this set of 4.1R cDNAs. Mutational studies indicated that the short isoforms were not proteolytic products of the long isoforms but products synthesized from AUG2. The presence of a cryptic promoter in the 4.1R cDNA sequence was also discounted. When a 583 nt sequence comprised between AUG1 and AUG2 was introduced into bicistronic vectors it directed protein expression from the second cistron. This was also the case when ribosome scanning was abolished by introduction of a stable hairpin at the 5\" region of the first cistron. Deletion analysis of the 583 nt sequence indicated that nucleotides 170 to 368 are essential for expression of the second cistron. The polypyrimidine tract-binding protein bound to the 583 nt active sequence but not to an inactive 3\"-fragment of 149 nucleotides.",
        "YKL-40 is a chitinase-like protein involved in matrix remodelling and a non-invasive fibrosis marker.

Histological fibrosis scores and YKL-40 serum levels (ELISA) were associated with CHI3L1 -131G-->C by quantitative and qualitative genetic analyses and corrected by multivariate analysis.\n\nCHI3L1 -131G-->C genotype was strongly associated with the stage of liver fibrosis in the screening (n=265, P=0.001) and validation cohort (n=175, P=0.009). Homozygous carriers of the G allele were protected from severe fibrosis (F3/F4). This association was confirmed after correction for age and gender. Functionally, the G allele was associated with reduced serum levels of YKL-40 in HCV infected patients (P=0.002).",
        "Ghrelin, the most important modulator of endocrine and exocrine pancreatic functions, has a role in the development of islets of Langerhans during embryogenesis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of ghrelin on pancreatic regeneration in rats with 90% pancreatectomy.\n\nTwo- to 3-week-old Wistar rats were used in the study. After anesthesia, 90% pancreatectomy was performed. In the ghrelin group, 90% pancreatectomy was performed. Ten nanomoles per kilogram per day of ghrelin was administered intraperitoneally from the first postoperative day. In the antagonist group, 90% pancreatectomy was performed. From the first postoperative day, rats received the ghrelin receptor antagonists and substance P intraperitoneally at 1 mumol/kg. In the control group, 90% pancreatectomy was performed, and intraperitoneal saline was administered. The sham group did not receive pancreatectomy. Eight rats from each group were randomly selected and sacrificed on the second, third, and 30th days.\n\nBlood glucose levels in pacreatectomized rats were significantly higher than in rats in the sham group. The number of beta islet cells, serum insulin levels, and PDX-1 and cytokeratin staining scores decreased in rats with pancreatectomy when compared to the sham-group rats. In the ghrelin-receiving rats, blood glucose levels tended to decrease from the 15th postoperative day. Ghrelin treatment increased insulin levels, insulin-positive islet cell number, and 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine and PDX-1 staining, whereas ghrelin antagonist administration resulted in significant decreases in these parameters. Ghrelin treatment significantly improved glucose tolerance test results.",
        "Oxaliplatin is detoxified by conjugation to glutathione via the enzyme Glutathione-S-transferase pi (GSTP1). The aim of this study is to investigate the association of GSTP1 Ile105Val genetic polymorphism with oxaliplatin efficacy and toxicity in advanced colorectal cancer (ACC) patients.\n\nA total of 91 ACC patients received capecitabine and oxaliplatin (CAPOX) as a part of a multicentre phase-III study of the Dutch Colorectal Cancer Group. Tumour response was evaluated according to RECIST, toxicity was graded using CTC, and GSTP1 Ile105Val was determined by pyrosequencing.\n\nOverall survival after CAPOX was similar for patients with the Ile/Ile (11.5 mo), Ile/Val (11.6 mo) and Val/Val (12.6 mo) genotypes (p=0.602). Likewise, there were no statistically significant differences in progression-free survival (p=0.252). Overall grades 3-4 toxicity was not related to genotype (p=0.313). There were no differences in any grade or grades 3-4 neurotoxicity amongst the patients who received > or =500 mg/m(2) of oxaliplatin (p-values of 0.376 and 0.772, respectively).",
        "The purpose of the study was to determine if early mobilisation in patients with acute lower limb deep vein thrombosis (DVT) increases the incidence of symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) and to evaluate the predisposing factors for PE such as location of the thrombus and duration of symptoms.\n\nThe current study was a prospective randomised clinical trial. Between January 2005 and December 2007, 219 patients with acute lower limb DVT were enrolled in the study (118 males and 101 females); the mean age was 64.2 years.\n\n<15 days of initial symptoms, life expectancy >1 year, no life-threatening clinical conditions, and signed informed consent. The patients were randomised into two groups. Group A, 105 patients (47.9%) were hospitalized and received 5 days of bed rest; Group B, 114 patients (52.1%) received care at home with early walking and compression stockings. The primary end point was the presence of symptomatic PE during the first 10 days of treatment. The relationships between the duration of symptoms, location of the thrombus, and symptomatic PE were also analysed.\n\nFive cases of symptomatic PE were detected (2.3%), three in Group B and two in Group A. There was no significant difference in the occurrence of new PE between the two groups (P=0.54). Likewise, no difference was detected based on the duration of symptoms (P=0.62) and the location of the thrombus (P=0.43).",
        "Circadian ( approximately 24 hr) rhythms are generated by the central pacemaker localized to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus. Although the basis for intrinsic rhythmicity is generally understood to rely on transcription factors encoded by \"clock genes\n\n,        \"To test the hypothesis that loss of robust behavioral rhythmicity in Kcnma1(-/-) mice is due to the disruption of SFR rhythms in the SCN, we used multi-electrode arrays to record extracellular action potentials from acute wild-type (WT) and Kcnma1(-/-) slices. Patterns of activity in the SCN were tracked simultaneously for up to 3 days, and the phase, period, and synchronization of SFR rhythms were examined. Loss of BK channels increased arrhythmicity but also altered the amplitude and period of rhythmic activity. Unexpectedly, Kcnma1(-/-) SCNs showed increased variability in the timing of the daily SFR peak.",
        "Lipocalin 2, an iron binding protein, is abnormally expressed in some malignant human cancers and may play an important role in tumor metastasis. However, the roles of lipocalin 2 in breast cancer formation and metastasis have not been clearly shown. This study aimed to investigate the roles of lipocalin 2 in breast tumor metastasis.\n\nLipocalin 2 was overexpressed in the metastatic 4T1 murine mammary cancer cells. The effects of lipocalin 2 overexpression on the malignancy of breast cancer cells were examined using cell proliferation assay, migration assay, invasion assay, and soft agar assay in vitro. Tumor formation and metastasis abilities were examined using a well established mouse mammary tumor model in vivo.\n\nLipocalin 2 overexpression significantly enhanced the migration and invasion abilities of 4T1 cells in vitro, and lung metastasis in vivo. But overexpression of lipocalin 2 in 4T1 cells didn\"t affect cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth in vitro, and primary tumor weight in vivo. Further studies demonstrated that the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway could be a causative mechanism for the promotion of breast cancer migration/invasion induced by lipocalin 2 overexpression.",
        "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-specific IgE is a component of the host response to RSV infection, but its role in the subsequent enhancement of altered airway responsiveness is unknown.\n\nTo define the role of RSV-specific IgE in the enhancement of airway responsiveness on reinfection of newborn mice.\n\nMice were infected as newborns with RSV and were reinfected 5 weeks later. The role of IgE was determined by documenting RSV-specific IgE response after neonatal infection, and by assessing airway responsiveness on reinfection.\n\nAfter neonatal infection, wild-type (WT) mice developed an RSV-specific IgE response. On reinfection, these mice developed enhanced airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), airway eosinophilia, and mucus hyperproduction, and their T-cell cytokine response was skewed toward a T(H)2 phenotype. None of these altered responses developed on reinfection of IL-4(-/-)/IL-13(-/-) mice, and no RSV-specific IgE could be detected after neonatal infection of these mice. Fc epsilon RI(-/-) mice did not develop the enhanced AHR on reinfection, and airway eosinophilia and mucus production were significantly attenuated. These responses could be restored in deficient mice reconstituted with WT mast cells. In RSV-infected newborn WT mice, administration of anti-IgE prevented the enhancement of AHR and attenuated eosinophilia and mucus hyperproduction on reinfection, an effect that was associated with diminished T(H)2 cytokine production and increased IFN-gamma production.",

Twenty-three patients had their oocytes injected with reacted spermatozoa, 26 patient\"s oocytes were injected with nonreacted spermatozoa, and in 22 patients both reacted and nonreacted spermatozoa were injected.\n\nIntracytoplasmic sperm injection was performed under polarized light to selectively inject acrosome-reacted and acrosome-nonreacted spermatozoa.\n\nRates of fertilization, cleavage, pregnancy, implantation, and ongoing implantation.\n\nThere was no effect on the fertilizing capacity and embryo development of either type of sperm, whereas the implantation rate was higher in oocytes injected with reacted spermatozoa (39.0%) vs. those injected with nonreacted spermatozoa (8.6%). The implantation rate was 24.4% in the group injected with both reacted and nonreacted spermatozoa. The delivery rate per cycle followed the same trend.",
        "The severity of disease in patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) can vary significantly, even among patients with the same primary mutations. It is hypothesized that modifier genes play important roles in determining the severity of RP, including the retinitis pigmentosa 1 (RP1) form of disease. To investigate the basis of variation in disease expression for RP1 disease, the authors generated congenic mice with a gene-targeted retinitis pigmentosa 1 homolog (Rp1h) allele (Rp1h(tm1Eap)) on several different genetic backgrounds and analyzed their retinal phenotypes.\n\nThe Rp1h(tm1Eap) allele was placed onto the C57BL/6J, DBA1/J, and A/J backgrounds. Retinal function of the resultant congenic mice was evaluated using electroretinographic analyses. Retinal structure and ultrastructure were evaluated using light and electron microscopy. Rp1h protein location was determined with immunofluorescence microscopy.\n\nAnalysis of the retinal phenotype of incipient congenic (N6) B6.129S-Rp1h(+/tm1Eap), DBA.129S(B6)-Rp1h(+/tm1Eap), and A.129S(B6)-Rp1h(+/tm1Eap) mice at 1 year of age showed retinal degeneration only in the A.129S(B6)-Rp1h(+/tm1Eap) mice. Further analyses revealed that the photoreceptors of the fully congenic A.129S(B6)-Rp1h(+/tm1Eap) mice show evidence of degeneration at 6 months of age and are almost completely lost by 18 months of age. In contrast, the photoreceptor cells in the fully congenic B6.129S-Rp1h(+/tm1Eap) mice remain healthy up to 18 months.",
        "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of bovine lactoferrin (BLF) on human corneal epithelial wound healing using an in vitro alkali-induced wound model and to understand its role in promoting wound healing.\n\nConfluent human corneal limbal epithelial (HCLE) cells wounded using 0.5 microL of 0.1 M sodium hydroxide were treated with BLF (0, 0.1, 1, 2.5, and 5 mg/mL) or anti-human interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor neutralizing antibody (anti-IL-6 antibody; 1, 10, and 50 microg/mL) or tyrphostin AG1295 (an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor [PDGF] receptor kinase; 1 and 10 microM), IL-6, or PDGF-BB. The conditioned medium collected for BLF treatment (0 and 5 mg/mL) was analyzed using a protein array for a number of cytokines/growth factors involved in corneal wound healing. A preliminary animal study using mice was carried out to determine the effect of BLF on alkali wounds.\n\nBLF at 2.5 and 5 mg/mL promoted wound healing (P<0.01). During wound closure, BLF upregulated PDGF-BB 180-fold and IL-6 10-fold compared with control. Treatment with tyrphostin AG1295 (10 microM; P<0.01) or anti-IL-6 antibody (50 microg/mL; P<0.01) in the presence of BLF inhibited wound closure, whereas the addition of exogenous IL-6 and PDGF-BB promoted wound closure. Preliminary animal studies have shown that BLF (5 mg/mL) promotes alkali wound healing in vivo.",
        "Acylated ghrelin (AG) is a physiological GH secretion amplifier, in part stimulating GHRH neurones and antagonizing somatostatin activity. In humans, AG is one of the most potent pharmacological stimuli of GH secretion and, unlike GHRH, is refractory to the inhibitory effect of glucose, free fatty acids (FFA) and somatostatin. Somatotroph secretion is also profoundly modulated by the adrenergic system. Indeed, beta-adrenergic agonists abolish spontaneous and GHRH-stimulated GH secretion. Based on these data, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of beta adrenergic agonism on the GH response to AG.\n\nSix young healthy male volunteers underwent: (a) acute AG intravenous (iv) administration (1.0 microg/kg); (b) salbutamol infusion (SLB; 0.06 microg/kg/min iv); (c) AG + SLB; and (d) saline infusion. In all sessions GH levels were assayed every 15 min from time -30 to +210 min.\n\nSLB induced a significant (P < 0.05) inhibition of spontaneous GH secretion that persisted up to 75 min after SLB withdrawal. AG induced a marked increase (P < 0.01) in GH that was not modified by SLB.",
        "Even in the drug-eluting stent (DES) era, the restenosis rate of the follow-up period after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is higher in haemodialysis (HD) patients than in non-HD patients. Therefore, higher restenosis remains a clinical limitation in HD patients, and a simple clinical method to predict patients likely to have restenosis after stent implantation is attractive. The present study investigated the potential relationship between aortic valvular calcification (AVC) and angiographical restenosis at follow-up after DES implantation in patients on maintenance HD.\n\nIn the study, 97 patients were enrolled. We prospectively performed echocardiography before elective PCI with DES implantation. Angiographic follow-up was scheduled between 6 and 8 months after PCI. Restenosis at follow-up was defined as a diameter stenosis of > or =50% by measuring quantitative coronary angiography.\n\nOf the enrolled patients, 59 patients (60.8%) had AVC. Complete angiographical follow-up was obtained in 86 patients (88.7%). The angiographical restenosis rate during the follow-up period was 24.7% in patients with AVC and 8.9% in patients without AVC [hazard ratio (HR) 3.36; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18-9.56, P = 0.023]. Even after multivariate adjustment including covariates related to atherogenecity, AVC remained an independent predictor of restenosis after implanting DES (HR 3.83; 95% CI 1.14-12.9, P = 0.029). Late lumen loss suggesting neointimal growth after DES implantation was 0.28 +/- 0.70 mm in the non-AVC group and 0.64 +/- 0.90 mm in the AVC group (P = 0.013).",
        "Regenerating islet-derived family, member 4 (Reg IV) is associated with the progression of various cancers. The aim was to examine Reg IV expression in adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACCs) in salivary glands.\n\nReg IV expression was detected by immunohistochemistry and compared with clinicopathological parameters. Expression of phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (pEGFR), phosphorylated AKT (pAKT) and MUC2 was examined by immunohistochemistry. Reg IV function was assessed with Reg IV antisense S-oligodeoxynucleotides (AS) in ACC3 human ACC cells. Reg IV was expressed by salivary duct epithelia and acinus myoepithelia, but not in squamous epithelia. Reg IV expression was found in 41% (17/41) of ACCs, but in none of 40 oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs) and was associated with nodal metastasis (P = 0.047) and poor prognosis (P = 0.012) in ACCs. Reg IV expression was associated with pEGFR (14/17, 82%) in Reg IV+ ACCs, but had no relationship with pAKT or MUC2 expression in ACCs. Cell growth was inhibited by AS treatment in Reg IV+ ACC3 cells, but not in HSC-4 OSCC cells, whereas in vitro invasion of neither cell types was affected by AS treatment.",
        "Clinical isolates of Salmonella enterica serovar Haifa and Newport, which displayed extended multidrug resistance phenotypes, were investigated for the presence of Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI1) and the genetic organization of its antibiotic resistance gene clusters.\n\nThe S. enterica strains were isolated from humans in France in 2003 and 2004. Antibiotic susceptibility tests and various molecular techniques were used for detection and characterization of SGI1.\n\nWe identified SGI1 integrated in the 3\" end of the chromosomal thdF gene in six multidrug-resistant serovar Haifa and Newport strains. Two strains, of serovar Haifa and Newport, harboured the previously described SGI1-H variant. A new variant of the novel SGI1-Ks group, named SGI1-K6, revealed IS26-mediated rearrangements of the antibiotic resistance gene cluster in two serovar Newport strains. Two other serovar Newport strains harboured the SGI1-L complex class 1 integron containing the dfrA15 and bla(PSE-1) resistance gene cassettes. In addition, these variants of SGI1 also contained large IS26-composite transposons inserted by a transposition event in the SGI1 backbone. These IS26-composite transposons showed a similar genetic structure to the SGI1-K variants containing an In4-type integron, a mercury resistance operon and parts of Tn1721 and Tn5393. These extended resistance gene clusters containing up to 10 antibiotic resistance genes were named SGI1-L1 and -L2.",
        "Several functions have been attributed to the BRCA1 protein. A recent study suggests that BRCA1 is involved in the cellular antioxidant response by inducing the expression of genes involved in the antioxidant defense system and thus conferring resistance to oxidative stress. It is possible that individuals with a BRCA1 mutation might be susceptible to the effects of oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether women with a BRCA1 mutation exhibit increased indicators of oxidative stress.\n\nWe measured 3 markers of oxidative stress in vivo, the amounts of serum malondialdehyde and protein thiols, and 8-oxo-2\"-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) levels in 25 unaffected BRCA1 mutation carriers and 25 noncarrier control subjects.\n\nThere was no significant difference in serum malondialdehyde levels (P=.41), serum thiol levels (P=.85), or the number of 8-oxodG lesions (P=.49) in BRCA1 mutation carriers versus noncarriers.",
        "Hip fracture patients experience high pain levels during postoperative rehabilitation. The role of surgical technique on postoperative pain has not been evaluated previously.\n\nOne hundred and seventeen hip fracture patients were included in a descriptive prospective study. All patients received continuous epidural analgesia and were treated according to a standardized perioperative rehabilitation programme. Resting pain, pain on hip flexion, and walking were measured during daily physiotherapy sessions on a verbal five-point rating scale during the first four postoperative days. Patients were stratified into four groups according to surgical procedure: screws or pins, arthroplasty, dynamic hip screw (DHS), and intra-medullary hip screw (IMHS).\n\nCumulated pain levels were significantly different between surgical procedures both for hip flexion (P=0.002) and for walking (P=0.02) with highest dynamic pain levels for patients who had either DHSs or IMHSs compared with arthroplasty or parallel implants. There were significant negative correlations between ambulatory capacity assessed by the cumulated ambulation score and both the dynamic cumulated pain scores on hip flexion (r=-0.43, P<0.001) and walking (r=-0.36, P=0.004).",
        "Appendectomy is the treatment of choice in acute appendicitis in children. Delayed diagnosis of acute appendicitis in children can lead to complications like perforation. Studies on the diagnostic value of WBC and CRP in establishing the diagnosis of appendicitis have contradictory results. Our study evaluates the role of CRP in diagnosing appendicitis in a pediatric population.\n\nA retrospective chart study on 130 patients aged less than 19 years who had an appendectomy at Sparrow hospital during years 2002-2006 formed the basis for this report. Based on histology appendicitis was classified as simple or perforated (complicated).\n\nPatients (75 boys, 55 girls) were 6-18 years of age (median 14 years). The appendix was normal in 9/130 cases. Appendicitis was simple in 58/130 cases and perforated in 63/130 cases. Overall WBC count had the highest sensitivity in the prediction of (diagnosis) appendicitis at 88% whereas CRP was 69% and, WBC and CRP combined was 60%. PPV of WBC was highest at 0.81 (47/58) for simple appendicitis and 0.93 (59/63) for perforated appendicitis, when compared to CRP at 0.57 (33/58) and 0.81 (51/63); and CRP and WBC combined at 0.45 (26/58) and 0.75 (47/63).",

        "The tissue factor pathway inhibitor-2 (TFPI-2) is a Kunitz-type serine-protease inhibitor which is expressed in atherosclerotic plaques. Epigenetic regulation of the TFPI-2 gene, through methylation of CpG islands, has been advocated in cancer. We hypothesized that TFPI-2 gene methylation could regulate TFPI-2 expression in atherosclerosis.\n\nWe used Methylation Specific PCR (MSP) and pyrosequencing in order to identify 18 CpG of the TFPI-2 promoter, in 59 carotid atherosclerotic plaques and 26 control mammary arteries.\n\nMSP showed methylation of the TFPI-2 gene (MSP+) in 16 plaques (27%), while no methylation (MSP-) was found in control arteries. Pyrosequencing confirmed that MSP+ plaques presented higher methylation levels than MSP- ones and arteries (p=0.03 and 0.01). Moreover, the TFPI-2 mRNA levels were lower in methylated plaques than in unmethylated ones and than in arteries (p=0.04 and <0.0001). The methylated plaques contained less lipids and macrophage infiltration than unmethylated ones. Their TFPI-2 immunoreactivity was mainly detected in the macrophages located in the media on the adventitial side, rather than in the lipid-rich core.",
        "Allergic asthma is consistently associated with increased FE(NO) levels whereas divergence exists regarding the use of exhaled nitric oxide (NO) as marker of inflammation in nonallergic asthma and in asthmatic smokers. The aim of this study is to analyze the effect of having allergic or nonallergic asthma on exhaled nitric oxide levels, with special regard to smoking history.\n\nExhaled NO measurements were performed in 695 subjects from Turin (Italy), Gothenburg and Uppsala (both Sweden). Current asthma was defined as self-reported physician-diagnosed asthma with at least one asthma symptom or attack recorded during the last year. Allergic status was defined by using measurements of specific immunoglobulin E (IgE). Smoking history was questionnaire-assessed.\n\nAllergic asthma was associated with 91 (60, 128) % [mean (95% CI)] increase of FE(NO) while no significant association was found for nonallergic asthma [6 (-17, 35) %] in univariate analysis, when compared to nonatopic healthy subjects. In a multivariate analysis for never-smokers, subjects with allergic asthma had 77 (27, 145) % higher FE(NO) levels than atopic healthy subjects while subjects with nonallergic asthma had 97 (46, 166) % higher FE(NO) levels than nonatopic healthy subjects.

        "Treatment of cancer patients with anthracycline antibiotic doxorubicin (DOX) may be complicated by development of acute and chronic congestive heart failure (CHF), malignant arrhythmias and death. The aim of this study was to test whether an aqueous low molecular weight (LMW) extract from cod muscle decreases acute mortality in the mouse model of acute CHF caused by DOX.\n\nA LMW fraction (<500 Da) of the aqueous phase of cod light muscle (AOX) was used for treatment of male BALB/c mice (approximately 25 g, n = 70). The animals were divided into four groups, DOX + AOX (n = 20), DOX + saline (NaCl) (n = 30), NaCl + AOX (n = 10) and NaCl only (n = 10). Echocardiography was performed in the separate subgroups (DOX treated n = 6 and controls n = 6) to verify the presence and the grade of acute CHF. The cod extract was delivered by subcutaneously implanted osmotic minipumps over the period of 2 weeks. High-dose injection of DOX was administered to randomly selected animals. The animals received single intraperitoneal injection of DOX (25 mg/kg) and were followed over two weeks for mortality.\n\nMortality rate was 68% lower (p < 0.05) in the mice treated with the extract. The analyses of cod extract have shown strong antioxidative effect in vitro.",
        "Exposure to particulate matter is a risk factor for cardiopulmonary disease but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. In the present study we sought to investigate the cardiopulmonary responses on spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) following inhalation of UfCPs (24 h, 172 mug.m-3), to assess whether compromised animals (SHR) exhibit a different response pattern compared to the previously studied healthy rats (WKY).\n\nCardiophysiological response in SHRs was analyzed using radiotelemetry. Blood pressure (BP) and its biomarkers plasma renin-angiotensin system were also assessed. Lung and cardiac mRNA expressions for markers of oxidative stress (hemeoxygenase-1), blood coagulation (tissue factor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1), and endothelial function (endothelin-1, and endothelin receptors A and B) were analyzed following UfCPs exposure in SHRs. UfCPs-mediated inflammatory responses were assessed from broncho-alveolar-lavage fluid (BALF).\n\nIncreased BP and heart rate (HR) by about 5% with a lag of 1-3 days were detected in UfCPs exposed SHRs. Inflammatory markers of BALF, lung (pulmonary) and blood (systemic) were not affected. However, mRNA expression of hemeoxygenase-1, endothelin-1, endothelin receptors A and B, tissue factor, and plasminogen activator inhibitor showed a significant induction (~2.5-fold; p < 0.05) with endothelin 1 being the maximally induced factor (6-fold; p < 0.05) on the third recovery day in the lungs of UfCPs exposed SHRs; while all of these factors - except hemeoxygenase-1 - were not affected in cardiac tissues. Strikingly, the UfCPs-mediated altered BP is paralleled by the induction of renin-angiotensin system in plasma.",
        "To evaluate the in vitro effects of rapamycin in human transitional cell carcinoma and to clarify the possible rapamycin-hypoxia interactions.\n\nMonolayer cultures of RT112 (G1), RT4 (G1-2), T24 (G3), and SUP (G4) cells were incubated in medium with or without rapamycin (10 microM, 100 microM) in different gaseous conditions (1% oxygen plus 5% carbon dioxide plus 94% nitrogen or 95% oxygen plus 5% carbon dioxide or 21% oxygen plus 78% nitrogen). Cell vitality and proliferation were determined using the microculture tetrazolium assay. Apoptotic cells were quantified by flow cytometry. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to visualize inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) by rapamycin and synthesis of vascular endothelial growth factor.\n\nRapamycin delayed proliferation of cancer cell lines but did not induce apoptosis. No direct hypoxia interactions of rapamycin were found. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay gave evidence of mTOR inhibition in all cell lines and a significant decrease of hypoxia-induced vascular endothelial growth factor synthesis.",
        "Identifying shared and disease-specific susceptibility loci for Crohn\"s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) would help define the biologic relationship between the inflammatory bowel diseases. More than 30 CD susceptibility loci have been identified. These represent important candidate susceptibility loci for UC. Loci discovered by the index genome scans in CD have previously been tested for association with UC, but those identified in the recent meta-analysis await such investigation. Furthermore, the recently identified UC locus at ECM1 requires formal testing for association with CD.\n\nWe analyzed 45 single nucleotide polymorphisms, tagging 29 of the loci recently associated with CD in 2527 UC cases and 4070 population controls. We also genotyped the UC-associated ECM1 variant rs11205387 in 1560 CD patients and 3028 controls.\n\nNine regions showed association with UC at a threshold corrected for the 29 loci tested (P < .0017). The strongest association (P = 4.13 x 10(-8); odds ratio = 1.27) was identified with a 170-kilobase region on chromosome 1q32 that contains 3 genes. We also found association with JAK2 and replicated a recently reported association with STAT3, further implicating the role of this signaling pathway in inflammatory bowel disease. Additional novel UC susceptibility genes were LYRM4 and CDKAL1. Twenty of the loci were not associated with UC, and several appear to be specific to CD. ECM1 variation was not associated with CD.",
        "Given that obesity is a risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee, a study was undertaken to determine whether progressively higher body mass index (BMI) among obese women is associated with progressive increases in joint space narrowing (JSN).\n\nMedial compartment JSN over 12 months in Lyon Schuss radiographs of 60 obese women (BMI 30.0-50.5 kg/m(2)) with radiographic and symptomatic OA was compared with that in 81 non-obese women (BMI <28 kg/m(2)) with normal radiographs and minimal or no symptoms of knee OA.\n\nAmong the patients with OA, higher BMI tended to be associated with a higher Kellgren and Lawrence (KL) grade of OA severity. JSN in the non-obese controls was negligible, but in the 30 patients with KL grade 2 and KL grade 3 knees, mean (SD) JSN was 0.12 (0.31) mm and 0.32 (0.50) mm, respectively (p<0.005 and p<0.001). No association was seen between baseline BMI and 12-month JSN in patients with OA; indeed, the regression plot suggested a slight inverse relationship between the two.",
        "Airway smooth muscle (ASM) hyperplasia is a hallmark of asthma that is associated with disease severity and persistent airflow obstruction.\n\nWe sought to investigate whether fibrocytes, a population of peripheral blood mesenchymal progenitors, are recruited to the ASM compartment in asthma.\n\nWe assessed the number of fibrocytes in bronchial biopsy specimens and peripheral blood from subjects with mild-to-severe refractory asthma versus healthy control subjects. In vitro we investigated potential mechanisms controlling fibrocyte migration toward the ASM bundle.\n\nFifty-one subjects with asthma and 33 control subjects were studied. In bronchial biopsy specimens, the number of fibrocytes was increased in the lamina propria of subjects with severe refractory asthma (median [interquartile range] number, 1.9/mm(2) [1.7/mm(2)]) versus healthy control subjects (median [interquartile range] number, 0/mm(2) [0.3/mm(2)], P < .0001) and in the ASM bundle of subjects with asthma of all severities (subjects with severe asthma, median [interquartile range] number, 3.8/mm(2) [9.4/mm(2)]; subjects with mild-to-moderate asthma, median [interquartile range] number, 1.1/mm(2) [2.4/mm(2)]); healthy control subjects, (median [interquartile range] number, 0/mm(2) [0/mm(2)]); P = .0004). In the peripheral blood the fibrocyte number was also increased in subjects with severe refractory asthma (median [interquartile range] number, 1.4 x 10(4)/mL [2.6 x 10(4)/mL]) versus healthy control subjects (median [interquartile range] number, 0.4 x 10(4)/mL [1.0 x 10(4)/mL], P = .002). We identified that in vitro ASM promotes fibrocyte chemotaxis and chemokinesis (distance of migration after 4.5 hours, 31 microm [2.9 microm] vs 17 microm [2.4 microm], P = .0001), which was in part mediated by platelet-derived growth factor (mean inhibition by neutralizing antibody, 16% [95% CI, 2% to 32%], P = .03) but not by activation of chemokine receptors.",
        "A T(H)1-specific transcription factor, T-box-containing protein expressed in T cells (T-bet), controls the production of both T(H)1 and T(H)2 cytokines in T(H) cell differentiation by means of distinct mechanisms. T-bet-deficient mice overproduce T(H)2 cytokines and have spontaneous airway inflammation.\n\nWe tested whether T-bet overexpression could protect against the development or progression of asthma.\n\nWe generated a T cell-specific and inducible line of T-bet-transgenic mice on a T-bet-deficient genetic background and used it to study the function of T-bet in an ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthma model.\n\nInduction of T-bet in a T cell-specific manner in an OVA model of asthma concomitant with OVA injection prevented airway hyperresponsiveness, eosinophilic and lymphocytic inflammation, and IL-5 and IL-13 production in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and also reduced serum IgE and T(H)2 cytokine production by peripheral T cells. Even when T-bet expression was induced during later stages of asthma progression, T-bet overexpression still attenuated airway hyperresponsiveness and goblet cell hyperplasia, as well as T(H)2 cytokine production.",
        "Standardised neuropsychological and cognitive measures present some limitations in their applicability and generalisability to individuals with intellectual disability (ID). Alternative approaches to defining the cognitive signatures of various forms of ID are needed to advance our understanding of the profiles of strengths and weaknesses as well as the affected brain areas.\n\nTo evaluate the utility and feasibility of six non-verbal comparative neuropsychological (CN) tasks administered in a modified version of the Wisconsin General Test Apparatus (WGTA) to confirm and extend our knowledge of unique cognitive signatures of Fragile X syndrome (FXS) and Down syndrome (DS).\n\nA test battery of CN tasks adapted from the animal literature was administered in a modified WGTA. Tasks were selected that have established or emerging brain-behaviour relationships in the domains of visual-perceptual, visual-spatial, working memory and inhibition.\n\nDespite the fact that these tasks revealed cognitive signatures for the two ID groups, only some hypotheses were supported. Results suggest that whereas individuals with DS were relatively impaired on visual-perceptual and visual-spatial reversal learning tasks they showed strengths in egocentric spatial learning and object discrimination tasks. Individuals with FXS were relatively impaired on object discrimination learning and reversal tasks, which was attributable to side preferences. In contrast, these same individuals exhibited strengths in egocentric spatial learning and reversal tasks as well as on an object recognition memory task. Both ID groups demonstrated relatively poor performance for a visual-spatial working memory task.",
        "The clinical behavior of follicular lymphoma is largely determined by properties of the non-malignant tumor microenvironment. The precise nature of the cell populations is still unclear and published data on their prognostic significance are highly conflicting. This may be partly due to heterogeneous composition and treatments.\n\nPre-treatment biopsy samples of patients with follicular lymphoma treated in an EORTC/BNLI trial comparing fludarabine to cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone (CVP) chemotherapy could be retrieved for 61 patients in five European countries. Immunohistochemical investigations were performed evaluate tumor cell characteristics, T-cell subsets, follicular dendritic cells and macrophages and associations with clinical outcome were studied.\n\nSome markers showed a homogeneous prognostic impact, while others had a different nd sometimes opposite effect in the treatment arms. CD69 expression on tumor cells was a poor prognostic sign and an interfollicular infiltrate of FoxP3-positive T cells was a good prognostic sign irrespective of the treatment arm. It is suggestive that a dense infiltrate of FoxP3-positive T cells, dense and interfollicular infiltrate of CD68-positive macrophages and complete follicular dendritic meshworks were associated with a favorable time to progression in CVP-treated patients, while being poor prognostic sign in fludarabine-treated patients.",
        "To estimate the effect of day of the week on the odds of being discharged alive from an intensive care unit (ICU).\n\nA longitudinal analysis of risk of discharge by day of the week.\n\n4569 patients admitted to the ICU of St Thomas\" Hospital, London, from 2002 to 2006.\n\nThe odds of being discharged alive were lowest on the weekend and literally climbed during the week.",
        "Human rhinoviruses (HRV) are now considered major respiratory pathogens. We sought to determine whether HRV are a cause of wheezing and/or hospitalization in children <2 years old.\n\nA polymerase chain reaction assay was used to screen for HRV infection in 4 categories of children <2 years old: (1) with symptoms of respiratory tract disease without wheezing; (2) with wheezing with or without other symptoms; (3) who were asymptomatic and; (4) who had a respiratory specimen submitted to a diagnostic laboratory. All specimens were collected between January and December 2004. Phylogenetic analyses were performed on most HRV isolates.\n\nTwenty-eight (17%) of 165 children with symptoms of respiratory infection without wheezing; 21 (26.3%) of 80 children with wheezing; 3 (3%) of 93 asymptomatic children; and 47 (23.3%) of 202 children with specimens submitted to the diagnostic laboratory tested positive for HRV. The difference between the rates of infection in the asymptomatic group and in each of the 3 other categories was statistically significant (P </= 0.01). Among HRV-positive children with samples submitted to the diagnostic laboratory, 55% were hospitalized, which was similar to that observed for respiratory syncytial virus (52.7%) among children of a similar age group and time period (P = 0.85). Diverse groups of HRV were circulating during the 1-year study period.",
        "For adenovirus vectors derived from human serotype 5 (Ad5), the efficiency and safety after intravascular delivery is hindered by their sequestration in nontarget tissues, predominantly the liver. The latter is largely dictated by adenovirus binding to blood coagulation zymogens. In addition, several target cells, such as endothelial and smooth muscle cells, are difficult to transduce by Ad5 due to the low expression of the primary coxsackie-adenovirus receptor (CAR). Therefore, alternative adenovirus serotypes are being explored.\n\nIn the present study, we assessed the tropism of mouse adenovirus type 1 (MAV-1), a nonhuman adenovirus for which cellular attachment is CAR-independent.\n\nThe typical replication of MAV-1 in endothelial cells as observed in vivo was not reflected in elevated attachment to primary and continuous endothelial cells in cell culture. Remarkably, MAV-1 displayed a higher affinity for primary human smooth muscle cells than recombinant Ad5 (rAd5). Attachment of MAV-1 to human and mouse cells of hepatocyte origin was not altered by physiological concentrations of human coagulation factor XI (FXI) or the vitamin K-dependent FIX, FX and FVII. By contrast, attachment of Ad5-derived vectors was enhanced at least eight-fold by FX. Using surface plasmon resonance, MAV-1 was shown to directly associate with human FX and murine FX and FIX but, opposite to rAd5, this interaction did not lead to enhanced cellular attachment. In intravenously injected severe combined immunodeficiency mice, distribution of MAV-1 to the liver was markedly lower than that observed with rAd5.",
        "Endothelial dysfunction plays a central role in atherosclerotic progression and cardiovascular complications of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Given the role of nitric oxide in the vascular system, we aimed to test hypotheses of synergy between the common endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) Asp298 allele and T2DM in predisposing to acute myocardial infarction (AMI).\n\nIn a population-based patient survey with 403 persons with T2DM and 799 healthy subjects from the population without diabetes or hypertension, we analysed the relation between T2DM, sex and the eNOS Asp298 allele versus the risk for AMI.\n\nIn an overall analysis, T2DM was a significant independent risk factor for AMI. In patients with T2DM, homozygosity for the eNOS Asp298 allele was a significant risk factor (HR 3.12 [1.49-6.56], p = 0.003), but not in subjects without diabetes or hypertension. Compared to wild-type non-diabetic subjects, all patients with T2DM had a significantly increased risk of AMI regardless of genotype. This risk was however markedly higher in patients with T2DM homozygous for the Asp298 allele (HR 7.20 [3.01-17.20], p < 0.001), independent of sex, BMI, systolic blood pressure, serum triglycerides, HDL -cholesterol, current smoking, and leisure time physical activity. The pattern seemed stronger in women than in men.",
        "The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) in exon 8 (A2317G: Gln222Arg) has been shown to be associated with several diseases.\n\nThe allele frequency of the DNASE1 polymorphism in Chinese (Shenyang and Guangzhou in China), Uygurs (Urumqi), Tamils (Sri Lanka), and Tibetans (Katmandu in Nepal) was investigated, and the results were compared with those of other studies.\n\nThis study revealed that DNASE1*1 is more common in Africans and DNASE1*2 is more common in Caucasians. Expression vectors of DNASE1*1 and DNASE1*2 were constructed and compared to the enzyme properties secreted into a medium from transfected COS-7 cells. The activity of the type-2 enzyme was significantly higher than that of the type-1 enzyme. In addition, the type-1 enzyme was heat-labile when compared to the type-2 enzyme. Moreover, the optimum pH of the DNase I type-2 enzyme was more acidic than that of DNase I type-1.",
        "Ketosis prone type 2 diabetes (KPD) is an atypical form of diabetes described mainly in people of sub-Saharan African origin. Its pathogenesis is unknown, although we have previously described a high prevalence of glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency in patients with KPD. However, 50% of these deficient patients lacked the G6PD gene mutation. The isoforms of the transcription factor sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP-1) are known to stimulate G6PD gene expression, and some polymorphisms in the SREBP-1 gene (SREBF-1) have been described only in Africans. We investigated one of these, the Arg585Gln polymorphism, in a candidate gene approach for KPD.\n\nWe examined the presence of the Arg585Gln polymorphism in SREBF-1 in 217 consecutive unrelated Africans [73 patients with KPD, 80 with classical type 2 diabetes (T2D) and 64 nondiabetic subjects]. Patients underwent clinical and biochemical evaluations, and were assessed for G6PD activity and insulin secretion (glucagon test).\n\nThere were no differences in frequency of the Arg585Gln polymorphism and the 585Gln allele among the three groups (allele frequency: KPD: 0.089, T2D: 0.031, nondiabetic group: 0.070; P=0.1). When the 585Gln allele frequency was compared separately between patients with KPD and those with T2D, it was significantly higher in the former (P=0.032). There was no difference between carriers and noncarriers of the 585Gln allele regarding G6PD activity and insulin secretion.",
        "Based on combined data for 4880 patients, 2 previous studies reported that advanced age is a predictor of increased renal cell carcinoma-specific mortality (RCC-SM). We explored the effect of age in cubic spline analyses to identify the age groups with the most elevated risk for renal cell carcinoma (RCC).\n\nOur study included 3595 patients from 14 European centres who had partial or radical nephrectomies. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to compile life tables, and we performed Cox regression analyses to assess RCC-SM. Covariates included age at diagnosis, sex, TNM (tumour, node, metastasis) stage, tumour size, Fuhrman grade, symptom classification and histological subtype.\n\nAge ranged from 10 to 89 (mean 63, median 67) years. The median duration of follow-up was 2.9 years. The median survival for the cohort was 13.4 years. Stage distribution was as follows: 1915 patients (53.3%) had stage I disease, 388 (10.8%) had stage II, 895 (24.9%) had stage III and 397 (11.0%) had stage IV disease. In multivariate analyses, we coded age at diagnosis as a cubic spline, and it achieved independent predictor status (p < 0.001). The risk of RCC-SM was lowest among patients younger than 50 years. We observed an increase in RCC-SM until the age of 50, at which point the level of risk reached a plateau. We observed a second increase among patients aged 75-89 years. We found similar patterns when we stratified patients according to the 2002 American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stages.",
        "Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) plays a key role in allergic diseases, such as atopic dermatitis (AD) and asthma. TSLP is highly expressed by keratinocytes in skin lesions of patients with AD, but environmental triggers for its release from keratinocytes with endogenous factors are not well understood. Patients with AD, in whom allergic sensitization is already established, are susceptible to viral dissemination.\n\nWe investigated TSLP\"s release from primary human keratinocytes stimulated with a Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 ligand, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, which mimics viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), and its modulation by cytokines.\n\nPrimary human keratinocytes were stimulated with TLR ligands, cytokines, or both. TSLP released into culture supernatants was measured by means of ELISA.\n\nStimulation of keratinocytes with dsRNA induced release of TSLP and upregulated gene expression of TSLP and other cytokines and chemokines. The release of TSLP was enhanced by the addition of IL-4, IL-13, and/or TNF-alpha. With or without the T(H)2/TNF cytokines, the dsRNA-induced release of TSLP was upregulated by IFN-alpha and IFN-beta and suppressed by IFN-gamma, TGF-beta, or IL-17.",
        "Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and circulating mesenchymal progenitor cells (MSCs) with a VSMC phenotype contribute to neointima formation and lumen loss after angioplasty and during allograft arteriosclerosis. We hypothesized that phosphoinositol-Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin-p70S6 kinase (PI3K/Akt/mTOR/p70S6K) pathway activation regulates VSMC differentiation from MSCs.\n\nWe studied effects of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling on phenotypic modulation of MSC and VSMC marker expression, including L-type Ca(2+) channels. Phosphorylation of Akt and p70S6K featured downregulation of VSMC markers in dedifferentiated MSCs. mTOR inhibition with rapamycin at below pharmacological concentrations blocked p70S6K phosphorylation and induced a differentiated contractile phenotype with smooth muscle (sm)-calponin, sm-alpha-actin, and SM protein 22-alpha (SM22alpha) expression. The PI3K inhibitor Ly294002 abolished Akt and p70S6K phosphorylation and reversed the dedifferentiated phenotype via induction of sm-calponin, sm-alpha-actin, SM22alpha, and myosin light chain kinase. Rapamycin acted antiproliferative without impairing MSC viability. In VSMCs, rapamycin increased a homing chemokine for MSCs, stromal cell-derived factor-1-alpha, at mRNA and protein levels. The CXCR4-mediated MSC migration toward conditioned medium of rapamycin-treated VSMCs was enhanced.",

Histology was done by standard protocols. DNA isolation and direct DNA sequencing was undertaken for mutation identification. Site-directed mutagenesis was used for incorporation of mutation in the androgen receptor clone. Functional assays were done using COS-1 cell cultures.\n\nPhenotype, hormone levels, DNA mutations, ligand binding, transactivation function of androgen-androgen receptor complex.\n\nThe patients exhibited a female phenotype despite the 46,XY chromosome complement. Both of the affected individuals had higher levels of T and LH. C1760A (coding DNA sequence reference) substitution (Ala 586 Asp) in the AR gene was observed in all of the affected individuals. The mutation did not result in a loss of ligand binding but instead in almost complete loss of transactivation function.",
        "To determine whether patients with erectile dysfunction (ED) have a higher incidence of insulin resistance (IR) when compared with controls.\n\nProspective case-control study.\n\nAcademic medical center.\n\nTwenty-nine nondiabetic men aged 18-66 years were enrolled. Of these, 28 completed the study: 17 had ED, and 11 did not.\n\nValidated ED questionnaires, examination, serum hormones evaluation, and oral glucose tolerance testing.\n\nAssociation of IR with ED.\n\nThe association between worsening degrees of both lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and ED was reaffirmed, as was a potential correlation between the two-epinephrine. There was a negative association between serum levels of epinephrine and scores on the 5-item version of the International Index of Erectile Dysfunction for ED (Spearman correlation coefficient = -0.38). On the other hand, men with ED were not more likely to have IR compared with controls.",
        "Cancer stem cells are defined by their self-renewal and multi-potential capabilities and are hypothesized to be the source of primary and recurrent cancers. The stem cell properties of self-renewal and pluripotency in embryonic stem cells and germ cells are regulated by Oct4A, a splice variant of the POU5F1 (Oct3/4) gene, while the function of the alternative splice variant, Oct4B, is unknown. Rare cells that express Oct4 were identified in several somatic cancers, however, the differential contributions of the Oct4A and Oct4B variants were not determined.\n\nOct4A expression and co-localization with lineage markers was performed with PCR and immunohistochemistry.\n\nRare Oct4A expressing cells are present in human benign and malignant prostate glands and the number of Oct4A expressing cells increases in prostate cancers with high Gleason scores. Oct4A expressing cells were non-proliferative, and did not co-express markers of basal epithelial cell or luminal epithelial cell differentiation, or AMACR, a marker of prostate cancer epithelial cells. A subpopulation of the Oct4A expressing cells co-expressed Sox2, an embryonic stem cell marker, but did not express other putative stem cell markers, such as ABCG2, NANOG or CD133. The majority of Oct4A expressing cells co-expressed chromogranin A, and a subset of Oct4A expressing cells co-expressed synaptophysin, both markers of neuroendocrine differentiation.",
        "Pregnant goat does can develop various metabolic diseases during late pregnancy that may have profound effects on their health and productivity, including subclinical pregnancy toxemia.\n\nThis study was performed to evaluate serum biochemical findings in goats in late pregnancy with and without subclinical pregnancy toxemia.\n\nSerum samples were obtained from 153 clinically healthy goats in the last trimester of pregnancy from 14 herds in central and northern Jordan. Serum was analyzed for the following constituents: 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-HB), glucose, total protein, albumin, urea, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, cholesterol, triglycerides, cortisol, T3, T4, total calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus, using commercially available kits. Goats were classified as having subclinical pregnancy toxemia or as controls on the basis of 3-HB results. Biochemical results were compared between the 2 groups using nonparametric statistical tests.\n\nFifty-three does had subclinical pregnancy toxemia (3-HB>0.86 mmol/L) and 100 were pregnant control does (3-HB< or =0.86 mmol/L). Does with subclinical pregnancy toxemia had significantly lower glucose concentrations (P<.001) and significantly higher urea (P=.042) and total protein (P=.048) concentrations compared with pregnant control does. 3-HB concentration was significantly correlated with glucose (r=0.290, P=.035), phosphorus (r=0.351, P=.01), and cortisol (r=0.394, P=.004) concentrations in goats with subclinical toxemia.",
        "Many lactating women in North America are exposed to high synthetic folic acid intakes because of food fortification and vitamin supplement use. Few data exist on the potential long-term effect of high folic acid intakes on milk folate concentrations, whereas no data are available on the effect of supplemental [6S]-5-methyltetrahydrofolate ([6S]-5-methylTHF).\n\nThe aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of 3 treatments (placebo, folic acid, and [6S]-5-methylTHF) on milk folate and folate-binding protein (FBP) concentrations and to determine whether unmetabolized folic acid is present in milk.\n\nIn this 16-wk randomized, placebo-controlled intervention, 69 lactating women were randomly assigned to receive [6S]-5-methylTHF (416 microg/d, 906 nmol/d) or a placebo, or were assigned to receive folic acid (400 microg/d, 906 nmol/d) within 1 wk postpartum. Total milk folate, FBP, and unmetabolized folic acid concentrations were measured at 16 wk.\n\nUnmetabolized folic acid was detected in 96% of milk samples tested representing approximately 8% of total milk folate concentrations. Total milk folate, FBP, and the proportion of unmetabolized milk folic acid did not differ between treatments; however, FBP concentrations were significantly lower than those published before mandatory folic acid fortification of the food supply.",
        "Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in the hematopoiesis of granulocytes, neuroprotection, and immunomodulation. Previously, we have shown that probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 induces G-CSF production from bone marrow-derived macrophages. Whether this probiotic also induces G-CSF in intestinal mononuclear cells is unknown.\n\nG-CSF release in response to L. rhamnosus GR-1 was analyzed in isolated intestinal lamina propria mononuclear cells from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and non-IBD patients. The effects of G-CSF on proinflammatory cytokine production in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and intestinal tissue from C57BL/6 wildtype and G-CSF receptor knockout mice was examined.\n\nNormal mouse or human intestinal lamina propria cells constitutively express high levels of G-CSF, of which production was further enhanced by exogenous L. rhamnosus GR-1. However, cells obtained from IBD patients showed reduced G-CSF production under basal conditions and also lower production after exogenous GR-1 treatments. Intestinal tissue samples isolated from G-CSF receptor-deficient mice constitutively expressed higher levels of TNFalpha, IL-23, and IL-12 than those from wildtype mice, and pretreatment of G-CSF suppressed lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced IL-23 in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.",
        "Although amygdala dysfunction is reported in schizophrenia, it is unknown whether this deficit represents a heritable phenotype that is related to risk for schizophrenia or whether it is related to disease state. The purpose of the present study was to examine amygdala response to threatening faces among healthy siblings of schizophrenia patients in whom a subtler heritable deficit might be observed.\n\nParticipants were 34 schizophrenia patients, 29 unaffected siblings, and 20 healthy comparison subjects. Blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was conducted during an implicit facial information processing task. The N-back working memory task, which has been shown to elicit prefrontal cortex abnormalities in unaffected siblings of schizophrenia patients, was employed as a positive experimental control.\n\nSchizophrenia patients demonstrated a deficit in amygdala reactivity to negative face stimuli and an alteration, correlated with neuroleptic drug dosage, in the functional coupling between the amygdala and subgenual cingulate. In contrast, unaffected siblings showed a pattern that was not statistically different from that of healthy comparison subjects. During the N-back working memory task, both schizophrenia patients and their unaffected siblings demonstrated a pattern of inefficient prefrontal cortex engagement, which is consistent with earlier evidence that this pattern is related to genetic risk for schizophrenia.",
        "Although olfactory deficits are common in schizophrenia, their underlying pathophysiology remains unknown. Recent evidence has suggested that cAMP signaling may be disrupted in schizophrenia. Since cAMP mediates signal transduction in olfactory receptor neurons, this could contribute to the etiology of observed olfactory deficits. This study was designed to test this hypothesis by determining odor detection threshold sensitivities to two odorants that differ in their relative activations of this intracellular cAMP signaling cascade.\n\nThirty schizophrenia patients, 25 healthy comparison subjects, and 19 unaffected first-degree relatives of schizophrenia patients were studied. Odor detection threshold sensitivities were measured for the two odorants citralva and lyral. Although both have fruity/floral scents, citralva strongly activates adenylyl cyclase to increase cAMP levels, while lyral is a very weak activator of adenylyl cyclase.\n\nThere was a significant group-by-odor interaction. Both schizophrenia patients and unaffected first-degree relatives were impaired in their ability to detect lyral versus citralva. Comparison subjects were equally sensitive to both odorants. This selective deficit could not be explained by differences in age, sex, smoking, clinical symptom profile, or medication use.",
        "We evaluated the association of nutrient intake with Fe deficiency with regard to lifestyle factors and health condition in young Japanese women. Uniquely among developed countries, dietary habits render Japanese populations vulnerable to Fe deficiency, owing to their relatively low intake of Fe and high intake of Fe absorption inhibitors, such as green tea and soyabeans.\n\nA cross-sectional study.\n\nThe subjects were 1019 female Japanese dietetic students aged 18-25 years. Dietary habits during the preceding month were assessed using a previously validated, self-administered, diet history questionnaire. Blood analysis was performed to assess body Fe status. Subjects were categorized with Fe deficiency when their serum ferritin levels were <12 ng/ml. Twenty-nine dietary variables, i.e. intakes of energy, sixteen nutrients including Fe and twelve food groups, were analysed using multivariate logistic regression models adjusted for possible confounders.\n\nOf the subjects, 24.5% were categorized with Fe deficiency. However, no dietary factors assessed were significantly associated with Fe deficiency. The risk of Fe deficiency was significantly lower in women with infrequent or no menstrual cycles than in those with regular cycles (OR = 0.58; 95% CI 0.34, 1.00) and significantly higher in women with heavy menstrual flow than in women with average flow, albeit that these were self-reported (OR = 1.83; 95% CI 1.35, 2.48).",
        "Studies of infant siblings of children diagnosed with autism have allowed for a prospective approach to study the emergence of autism in infancy and revealed early behavioral characteristics of the broader autism phenotype. In view of previous findings of atypical eye gaze processing in children and adults with autism, the aim of this study was to examine the early autism phenotype in infant siblings of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (sib-ASD), focusing on the neural correlates of direct compared with averted gaze.\n\nA group of 19 sib-ASD was compared with 17 control infants with no family history of ASD (mean age=10 months) on their response to direct versus averted gaze in static stimuli.\n\nRelative to the control group, the sib-ASD group showed prolonged latency of the occipital P400 event-related potentials component in response to direct gaze, but they did not differ in earlier components. Similarly, time-frequency analysis of high-frequency oscillatory activity in the gamma band showed group differences in response to direct gaze, where induced gamma activity was late and less persistent over the right temporal region in the sib-ASD group.",
        "Vascular access (VA) dysfunction is a major clinical complication in the hemodialysis population and has a direct effect on dialysis outcome. This study was conducted to explore the role of microinflammation in the VA dysfunction in maintenance hemodialysis patients.\n\nForty-seven patients (male 35 and female 12) receiving maintenance hemodialysis were included for this study. They were divided into three groups: group 1 (n = 15), patients with initial hemodialysis and new arteriovenous fistula (AVF); group 2 (n = 18), patients treated with hemodialysis for long term with well-functional VA; group 3 (n = 14), maintenance hemodialysis patients with VA dysfunction. Biochemical parameters and serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) were determined. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) was determined by latex-enhanced immuno-nephelometric method. Tissues of radial artery were taken from group 1 and group 3 for the histological study. Expression of CD68 and MCP-1 in the radial artery was determined by immunohistochemistry.\n\nSerum hs-CRP in group 3 was significantly higher than those in group 1 and group 2 ((7.40 +/- 2.42) mg/L vs (4.21 +/- 1.62) mg/L and (5.04 +/- 3.65) mg/L, P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). Serum TNF-alpha in group 3 was significantly higher than those in group 1 and group 2 ((64.03 +/- 9.29) pg/ml vs (54.69 +/- 12.39) pg/ml and (54.05 +/- 7.68) pg/ml, P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). Serum IL-6 in group 3 was also significantly higher than those in group 1 and group 2 ((70.09 +/- 14.53) pg/ml vs (56.43 +/- 10.11) pg/ml and (60.77 +/- 9.70) pg/ml, P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). Patients in group 3 had a thicker internal layer of vessels than in group 1 ((0.356 +/- 0.056) mm vs (0.111 +/- 0.021) mm, P < 0.01). Expression of CD68 and MCP-1 in the fistula vessel walls in group 3 were much higher than those in group 1 (P < 0.01). Moreover, serum hs-CRP level was positively correlated with the neointimal hyperplasia, the expression of CD68 and MCP-1 in fistula vessel (P < 0.01, respectively).",
        "This study was to investigate the evidence for complement activation in renal biopsy specimens of patients with myeloperoxidase (MPO)-antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)-associated pauci-immune vasculitis.\n\nRenal biopsy specimens from seven patients with MPO-ANCA positive pauci-immune necrotizing crescentic glomerulonephritis (NCGN) were used to detect the staining of membrane attack complex (MAC), C3d, C4d, mannose-binding lectin (MBL), factor B and factor P using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Renal tissue from seven patients with minimal change disease (MCD) and two normal renal tissue were used as controls.\n\nMAC, C3d, factor B and factor P could be detected in glomeruli and small blood vessels with active vasculitis of patients with pauci-immune AAV, but not or scarcely in patients with MCD and in normal renal tissue. C3d and factor B co-localized with MAC, factor P colocalized with C3d. MBL and C4d were not detected in patients with AAV.",
        "Vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) is one of the most potent lymphangiogenic members of the VEGF family that has been associated with lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, we evaluated the relationship of preoperative serum VEGF-C (sVEGF-C) and survival in CRC patients.\n\nsVEGF-C levels were determined, prior to resection, in a cohort of 120 newly presenting patients with CRC by quantitative ELISA.\n\nPatients who had positive lymph node involvement and higher Dukes\" staging (C&D) were associated with shorter time to metastases as expected (p = 0.002 and 0.001, respectively). Patients with distant metastasis had significantly lower levels of sVEGF-C than those without histopathologically proven disease (p = 0.004). However, there was no significant difference in the median sVEGF-C level in patients with or without lymph node metastatic involvement (91 pg/ml vs. 124 pg/ml; p = 0.81). Patients with a sVEGF-C concentration less than the median value (103 pg/ml) showed a poorer overall survival than patients with sVEGF-C levels greater than the median; but this was not statistically significant.",
        "To determine the potential of directional diffusivities from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to predict clinical outcome of optic neuritis (ON), and correlate with vision, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and visual evoked potentials (VEP).\n\nTwelve cases of acute and isolated ON were imaged within 30 days of onset and followed prospectively. Twenty-eight subjects with a remote clinical history of ON were studied cross-sectionally. Twelve healthy controls were imaged for comparison. DTI data were acquired at 3T with a surface coil and 1.3 x 1.3 x 1.3 mm(3) isotropic voxels.\n\nNormal DTI parameters (mean +/- SD, microm(2)/ms) were axial diffusivity = 1.66 +/- 0.18, radial diffusivity = 0.81 +/- 0.26, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) = 1.09 +/- 0.21, and fractional anisotropy (FA) = 0.43 +/- 0.15. Axial diffusivity decreased up to 2.5 SD in acute ON. The decrease in axial diffusivity at onset correlated with visual contrast sensitivity 1 month (r = 0.59) and 3 months later (r = 0.65). In three subjects followed from the acute through the remote stage, radial diffusivity subsequently increased to > 2.5 SD above normal, as did axial diffusivity and ADC. In remote ON, radial diffusivity correlated with OCT (r = 0.81), contrast sensitivity (r = 0.68), visual acuity (r = 0.56), and VEP (r = 0.54).",
        "Mediastinitis is an infrequent, but significant complication of median sternotomy. Perioperative hyperglycemia is associated with increased morbidity, including infection in pediatric and adult cardiac surgical patients. We hypothesized that perioperative blood glucose levels would be higher in patients who later developed mediastinitis.\n\nWe examined the medical records of all infants and children diagnosed with poststernotomy mediastinitis (n = 24) from July 2001 to December 2005. Data recorded included postoperative blood glucose levels, age, diagnosis, operation, surgical complexity score, duration of operation and cardiopulmonary bypass, delayed sternal closure, perioperative use of steroids and total parenteral nutrition, and duration of postoperative inotropic and ventilatory support. Records of patients without mediastinitis matched for age, complexity score, and month of operation (control group, n = 32) were also reviewed. Data were analyzed with t-tests and chi-square tests. Variables with P < 0.21 on univariate tests were entered into a multivariate logistic regression model.\n\nInitially, postoperative blood glucose levels were elevated, but similar in both mediastinitis and control groups. The number of subjects having peak blood glucose levels >7.2 mm (>130 mg.dl(-1)) during the first 24 h was greater in the mediastinitis group (P = 0.07). The significant multivariate predictor of mediastinitis was 24 h peak blood glucose >7.2 mM (>130 mg.dl(-1)) (P = 0.039).",
        "Respiratory complications can undermine outcome from low cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) (C5-T1). Most devastating of these is catastrophic loss of airway control. This study sought to determine the incidence and effect of catastrophic airway loss (CLA) and to define the need for elective intubation with subsequent tracheostomy to prevent potentially fatal outcomes.\n\nA database of 54,838 consecutive patients treated in a level I trauma center between January 1988 and December 2004 was queried to identify patients with low cervical SCI, without traumatic brain injury. Patients were then stratified into complete or incomplete SCI groups, based on clinical assessment of their SCI. Mortality, age, injury severity, need for intubation, and tracheostomy were analyzed for each group using Fisher\"s exact test or Student\"s t test, as appropriate, accepting p < 0.05 as significant.\n\nOne hundred eighty-six patients met inclusion criteria. The majority of low cervical spinal cord injuries were complete (58%). Overall, 127 (68%) patients required intubation, 88 (69%) required tracheostomy, and 27 died (15% of study population). Between each group there were significant differences in age and Injury Severity Score, however, within each group there were no significant differences in either. Eleven CSCI patients were not intubated; four of whom were at family request. Six of the remaining seven patients encountered fatal catastrophic airway loss. One patient was discharged to rehabilitation. Patients with incomplete SCI required intubation less frequently (38%); however, 50% of those required tracheostomy for intractable pulmonary failure.",
        "Rituximab, a chimeric antibody targeted to the human CD20 molecule, is a major component of the R-CHOP protocol used to treat patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). It is also a very expensive drug. Though the response rate of R-CHOP is higher than that of CHOP alone, patients may still experience a poor response. One possible mechanism that may mediate the poor response to R-CHOP is poor binding of the drug to the CD20 molecule, perhaps due to mutations or polymorphisms of the CD20 gene that affect its structure. To test this hypothesis and perhaps define a new predictor of R-CHOP response, our pilot study evaluated the CD20 gene sequence from patients exhibiting a poor outcome to R-CHOP.\n\nEleven patients with DLBCL who exhibited a recurrence of their disease and/or died within 24 months of R-CHOP treatment were categorized as showing poor progression-free survival (poor outcomes). Paraffin-embedded tissue specimens from the original tumors were evaluated for mutations or polymorphisms of the CD20 gene. Furthermore, sections from these patients and as well as from matched control patients who were categorized as good outcome patients (no progression of their disease within 36 months) were stained with anti-CD20 antibody and compared for CD20 protein expression.\n\nDNA sequence analyses revealed that no mutations were observed in DNA from the coding region of the CD20 gene in any of the initial tumors from 11 patients who showed poor outcomes with R-CHOP therapy. One case showed a synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism in exon 2 (C216T; rs2070770; Ile>>Ile). No significant differences in CD20 expression was observed between good and poor outcome patients with R-CHOP.",
        "A paradoxical enhancement of the magnitude of the N1 wave of the auditory event-related potential (ERP) has been described when auditory stimuli are presented at very short (< 400 ms) inter-stimulus intervals (ISI). Here, we examined whether this enhancement is specific for the auditory system, or whether it also affects ERPs elicited by stimuli belonging to other sensory modalities.\n\nWe recorded ERPs elicited by auditory and somatosensory stimuli in 13 healthy subjects. For each sensory modality, 4800 stimuli were presented. Auditory stimuli consisted in brief tones presented binaurally, and somatosensory stimuli consisted in constant-current electrical pulses applied to the right median nerve. Stimuli were delivered continuously, and the ISI was varied randomly between 100 and 1000 ms. We found that the ISI had a similar effect on both auditory and somatosensory ERPs. In both sensory modalities, ISI had an opposite effect on the magnitude of the N1 and P2 waves: the magnitude of the auditory and the somatosensory N1 was significantly increased at ISI < or = 200 ms, while the magnitude of the auditory and the somatosensory P2 was significantly decreased at ISI < or = 200 ms.",
        "In this in vitro feasibility study we analyzed tissue fusion using bovine serum albumin (BSA) and Indocyanine green (ICG) doped polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds in combination with a diode laser as energy source while focusing on the influence of irradiation power and albumin concentration on the resulting tensile strength and induced tissue damage.\n\nA porous PCL scaffold doped with either 25% or 40% (w/w) of BSA in combination with 0.1% (w/w) ICG was used to fuse rabbit aortas. Soldering energy was delivered through the vessel from the endoluminal side using a continuous wave diode laser at 808 nm via a 400 microm core fiber. Scaffold surface temperatures were analyzed with an infrared camera. Optimum parameters such as irradiation time, radiation power and temperature were determined in view of maximum tensile strength but simultaneously minimum thermally induced tissue damage. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed to measure the influence of PCL on the denaturation temperature of BSA.\n\nOptimum parameter settings were found to be 60 seconds irradiation time and 1.5 W irradiation power resulting in tensile strengths of around 2,000 mN. Corresponding scaffold surface temperature was 117.4+/- 12 degrees C. Comparison of the two BSA concentration revealed that 40% BSA scaffold resulted in significant higher tensile strength compared to the 25%. At optimum parameter settings, thermal damage was restricted to the adventitia and its interface with the outermost layer of the tunica media. The DSC showed two endothermic peaks in BSA containing samples, both strongly depending on the water content and the presence of PCL and/or ICG.",
        "Adipose tissue gene expression analysis in humans now provides a tremendous means to discover the physiopathologic gene targets critical for our understanding and treatment of obesity. Clinical studies are emerging in which adipose gene expression has been examined in hundreds of subjects, and it will be fundamentally important that these studies can be compared so that a common consensus can be reached and new therapeutic targets for obesity proposed.\n\nWe studied the effect of the biopsy sampling methods (needle-aspirated and surgical) used in clinical investigation programs on the functional interpretation of adipose tissue gene expression profiles.\n\nA comparative microarray analysis of the different subcutaneous adipose tissue sampling methods was performed in age-matched lean (n = 19) and obese (n = 18) female subjects. Appropriate statistical (principal components analysis) and bioinformatic (FunNet) functional enrichment software were used to evaluate data. The morphology of adipose tissue samples obtained by needle-aspiration and surgical methods was examined by immunohistochemistry.\n\nBiopsy techniques influence the gene expression underlying the biological themes currently discussed in obesity (eg, inflammation, extracellular matrix, and metabolism). Immunohistochemistry experiments showed that the easier to obtain needle-aspirated biopsies poorly aspirate the fibrotic fraction of subcutaneous adipose tissue, resulting in an underrepresentation of the stroma-vascular fraction.",
        "The iron-regulatory peptide hepcidin is synthesized in the liver as an 84-aa pre-pro-hormone maturated by proteolysis through a consensus furin cleavage site to generate the bioactive 25-aa peptide secreted in the circulation. This peptide regulates iron export from enterocytes and macrophages by binding the membrane iron exporter, ferroportin, leading to its degradation. Whether pro-hepcidin could be secreted and reflect hepcidin levels remains an open question. However, the activity of the pro-peptide on ferroportin degradation has never been addressed.\n\nTo answer this question, we produced recombinant pro-hepcidin, both the wild-type form and a furin cleavage site mutant, and tested their activity on ferroportin levels in macrophagic J774 cells. Furin activity was also modulated using furin inhibitor or siRNA-mediated furin mRNA knockdown.\n\nWe found that pro-hepcidin could fully induce ferroportin degradation, but only when processed by furin to generate the mature hepcidin-25 form. Pro-hepcidin activity was abolished in the presence of furin inhibitor and diminished after siRNA-mediated knockdown of furin mRNA. Furthermore, the mutated version of pro-hepcidin was completely inefficient at degrading ferroportin in macrophages.",
        "Little is known about long-term cognitive side effects of adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. We thus examined incidence of dementia diagnoses in older women diagnosed with breast cancer, stratified by types of chemotherapy regimen.\n\nWe identified patients with incident dementia diagnoses through Medicare claims linked to the National Cancer Institute\"s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) tumor registry data. The study population (n = 6,932) consisted of women at least 68 years of age, who were diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer from 1994 through 2002 in one of the SEER areas and received chemotherapy as part of their cancer treatment. Excluded were women with a diagnosis of dementia within the 3 years prior to their cancer diagnosis.\n\nOur sample comprised mostly white women. The mean age was 74. Fifty-seven percent were estrogen receptor positive. Over 70% had no comorbidity. The use of taxol and anthracycline-based treatments increased from mid-1990s to early 2000. Increasing age at cancer diagnosis, Black ethnicity, living in a census tract with lower level of education, and increasing number of comorbidities were associated with new claims of dementia diagnoses after chemotherapy. There was no significant association between types of chemotherapy agents and risk of subsequent dementia diagnoses.",
        "The aim of this study was to survey the attitudes of 115 patients with the diagnosis of somatoform pain disorder, toward anticipated discrimination and mental illness stigma and how it is influenced by depressive symptoms.\n\n115 consecutive in- and outpatients with somatoform pain disorder (mean age: 50 +/- 11 years; 62% female) from the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Medical University of Vienna, were administered a modified 12-item version of Link\"s Perceived Stigma Questionnaire and the Beck Depression Inventory.\n\nWith regard to close personal relationships, such as taking care of children or dating, somatoform pain patients showed a rather high perceived stigma score (over 70% for both items). Also nearly 70% think that \"most employers\" would pass over the application of a psychiatric patient in favour of another applicant. The overall results show a significant correlation with depressive symptoms (r = 0.228 and p = 0.014).",
        "Angiogenesis is a pathological hallmark of portal hypertension. Although VEGF is considered to be the most important proangiogenic factor in neoangiogenesis, this process requires the coordinated action of a variety of factors. Identification of novel molecules involved in angiogenesis is highly relevant, since they may represent potential new targets to suppress pathological neovascularization in angiogenesis-related diseases like portal hypertension. The apelin/APJ signaling pathway plays a crucial role in angiogenesis. Therefore, we determined whether the apelin system modulates angiogenesis-driven processes in portal hypertension.\n\nPartial portal vein-ligated rats were treated with the APJ antagonist F13A for seven days. Splanchnic neovascularization and expression of angiogenesis mediators (Western blotting) was determined. Portosystemic collateral formation (microspheres), and hemodynamic parameters (flowmetry) were also assessed.\n\nApelin and its receptor APJ were overexpressed in the splanchnic vasculature of portal hypertensive rats. F13A effectively decreased, by 52%, splanchnic neovascularization and expression of proangiogenic factors VEGF, PDGF and angiopoietin-2 in portal hypertensive rats. F13A also reduced, by 35%, the formation of portosystemic collateral vessels.",
        "Nicotine exposure has been associated with weight loss and reduced weight gain. Previously, we have reported that nicotine exposure in rats is associated with reduced weight gain, unless diets are rigidly controlled. Leptin, a hormone released by adipose tissue, is believed to have appetite suppressant effects. We used a smokeless tobacco model to study leptin responses to nicotine or placebo treatment.\n\nWe studied 6-week-old male and female Sprague-Dawley rats, and implanted 50 mg of nicotine or placebo pellets. Weight gain was controlled by chow restriction in all four groups of rats. Systolic blood pressure was measured noninvasively, and glucose, insulin, free fatty acid, and leptin responses to an oral glucose load were determined at 8.5 weeks of age.\n\nMales were generally heavier than females, both before and after nicotine or placebo placement; there was no difference in weight between nicotine and placebo groups for each sex. Blood pressure was slightly, but not significantly, increased by nicotine treatment. Glucose, insulin, free fatty acid, and leptin responses to glucose were essentially unaffected by nicotine treatment.",
        "Cigarette smoking adversely affects endochondral ossification during the course of skeletal growth. Among a plethora of cigarette chemicals, nicotine is one of the primary candidate compounds responsible for the cause of smoking-induced delayed skeletal growth. However, the possible mechanism of delayed skeletal growth caused by nicotine remains unclarified. In the last decade, localization of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), a specific receptor of nicotine, has been widely detected in non-excitable cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that nicotine affect growth plate chondrocytes directly and specifically through nAChR to delay skeletal growth.\n\nWe investigated the effect of nicotine on human growth plate chondrocytes, a major component of endochondral ossification. The chondrocytes were derived from extra human fingers. Nicotine inhibited matrix synthesis and hypertrophic differentiation in human growth plate chondrocytes in suspension culture in a concentration-dependent manner. Both human and murine growth plate chondrocytes expressed alpha7 nAChR, which constitutes functional homopentameric receptors. Methyllycaconitine (MLA), a specific antagonist of alpha7 nAChR, reversed the inhibition of matrix synthesis and functional calcium signal by nicotine in human growth plate chondrocytes in vitro. To study the effect of nicotine on growth plate in vivo, ovulation-controlled pregnant alpha7 nAChR +/- mice were given drinking water with or without nicotine during pregnancy, and skeletal growth of their fetuses was observed. Maternal nicotine exposure resulted in delayed skeletal growth of alpha7 nAChR +/+ fetuses but not in alpha7 nAChR -/- fetuses, implying that skeletal growth retardation by nicotine is specifically mediated via fetal alpha7 nAChR.",
        "Macrophages, key regulators of healing/regeneration processes, strongly infiltrate ischemic tissues from patients suffering from critical limb ischemia (CLI). However pro-inflammatory markers correlate with disease progression and risk of amputation, suggesting that modulating macrophage activation state might be beneficial. We previously reported that thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is highly expressed in ischemic tissues during CLI in humans. TSP-1 is a matricellular protein that displays well-known angiostatic properties in cancer, and regulates inflammation in vivo and macrophages properties in vitro. We therefore sought to investigate its function in a mouse model of CLI.\n\nUsing a genetic model of tsp-1(-/-) mice subjected to femoral artery excision, we report that tsp-1(-/-) mice were clinically and histologically protected from necrosis compared to controls. Tissue protection was associated with increased postischemic angiogenesis and muscle regeneration. We next showed that macrophages present in ischemic tissues exhibited distinct phenotypes in tsp-1(-/-) and wt mice. A strong reduction of necrotic myofibers phagocytosis was observed in tsp-1(-/-) mice. We next demonstrated that phagocytosis of muscle cell debris is a potent pro-inflammatory signal for macrophages in vitro. Consistently with these findings, macrophages that infiltrated ischemic tissues exhibited a reduced postischemic pro-inflammatory activation state in tsp-1(-/-) mice, characterized by a reduced Ly-6C expression and a less pro-inflammatory cytokine expression profile. Finally, we showed that monocyte depletion reversed clinical and histological protection from necrosis observed in tsp-1(-/-) mice, thereby demonstrating that macrophages mediated tissue protection in these mice.",
        "The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) forms the outer blood-retinal barrier. It is unclear how culture conditions might alter barrier properties of isolated RPE. We examined whether retinal secretions that increase the barrier functions of tight junctions in vitro also make gene expression in general more in vivo-like.\n\nChick RPE from embryonic day 7 (E7) and E14 were cultured on filters. Media conditioned by organ culture of E14 neural retinas was added to the apical medium chamber. RNA was isolated to probe the chick genome on Affymetrix microarrays, and expression was compared to native E14 RPE. Expression was further analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry.\n\nMore than 86% of the genes expressed in vivo were expressed in basal culture conditions, including RPE-specific markers such as RPE65 and bestrophin. E14 retinal conditioned medium affected 15% of the transcriptome in E7 cultures (24% if serum was included), but only 1.9% in E14 cultures (12% with serum). Examination of 610 genes important for RPE function revealed that mRNAs for 17% were regulated by retinal conditioned medium alone in E7 cultures, compared to 6.2% for E14. For tight junctions, retinal conditioned medium had the most effect on members of the claudin family. Besides regulating mRNA levels, immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry suggested additional mechanisms whereby retinal secretions regulated protein expression and localization.",
        "To determine whether cadherin 23 and protocadherin 15 can substitute for one another in the maintenance of the retina and other tissues in the mouse. Does homozygosity for both v and av mutant alleles (i.e., a double homozygous mouse) cause retinal degeneration or an obvious retinal histopathology?\n\nWe generated mice homozygous for both Cdh23(v-6J) and Pcdh15(av-Jfb) alleles. The retinal phenotypes of double heterozygous and double homozygous mutant mice were determined by light microscopy and electroretinography (ERG). Histology on 32 different tissues, scanning electron microscopy of organ of Corti hair cells as well as serum biochemical and hematological examinations were evaluated.\n\nERG waves of double heterozygous and double homozygous mice showed similar shape, growth of the amplitude with intensity, and implicit time for both rod and cone pathway mediated responses. Mice homozygous for both Cdh23(v-6J) and Pcdh15(av-Jfb) mutations showed no sign of retinitis pigmentosa or photoreceptor degeneration but, as expected, were deaf and had disorganized hair cell sensory bundles.",
        "To assess patterns and correlates of spit [smokeless tobacco (ST)] use among high school males in rural California.\n\nAn 18-item, self-administered questionnaire was used to assess ST use among young males in 41 randomly selected high schools in 21 rural counties in California. To ensure confidentiality, students were instructed to seal their completed questionnaire in an attached envelope prior to returning it to the questionnaire administrator.\n\nOverall prevalence of ST use was 9.8 percent, significantly increasing with year in school from 5 percent among freshmen to 15 percent among seniors. ST use was highest among rodeo athletes at 42 percent compared with <6 percent among nonathletes; ST use was significantly higher among smokers (32 percent) who were 2.5-30 times more likely to use ST compared with nonsmokers, depending on race/ethnicity as a result of a significant race/ethnicity x smoking interaction of degree/magnitude. In addition, students who believed there was no, or slight risk of, harm from ST use were significantly more likely to use ST than students perceiving moderate or great risk, depending on race/ethnicity (odds ratios 3.6-13). Among all ST users, 40 percent used ST on at least 5 days in the previous week, 80 percent of those reporting a brand used the brand Copenhagen, and 41 percent (189) used ST within 30 minutes of waking.",
        "Beta-blockers reduce exercise capacity by attenuated increase in cardiac output, but it remains unknown whether performance also relates to attenuated cerebral oxygenation.\n\nActing as their own controls, eight healthy subjects performed a continuous incremental cycle test to exhaustion with or without administration of the non-selective beta-blocker propranolol. Changes in cerebral blood flow velocity were measured with transcranial Doppler ultrasound and those in cerebral oxygenation were evaluated using near-infrared spectroscopy and the calculated cerebral mitochondrial oxygen tension derived from arterial to internal jugular venous concentration differences.\n\nArterial lactate and cardiac output increased to 15.3 +/- 4.2 mM and 20.8 +/- 1.5 L min(-1) respectively (mean +/- SD). Frontal lobe oxygenation remained unaffected but the calculated cerebral mitochondrial oxygen tension decreased by 29 +/- 7 mmHg (P < 0.05). Propranolol reduced resting heart rate (58 +/- 6 vs. 69 +/- 8 beats min(-1)) and at exercise exhaustion, cardiac output (16.6 +/- 3.6 L min(-1)) and arterial lactate (9.4 +/- 3.7 mM) were attenuated with a reduction in exercise capacity from 239 +/- 42 to 209 +/- 31 W (all P < 0.05). Propranolol also attenuated the increase in cerebral blood flow velocity and frontal lobe oxygenation (P < 0.05) whereas the cerebral mitochondrial oxygen tension decreased to a similar degree as during control exercise (delta 28 +/- 10 mmHg; P < 0.05).",

Factors evaluated included self-reported food allergy, gender, age, poverty area residence, race/ethnicity, inhaled steroid exposure, tobacco exposure, length of hospital stay, psychologic comorbidity, and season of admission.\n\nAt least one food allergy was documented for 13% (38/288) of the patients. Egg, peanut, fish/shellfish, milk, and tree nut accounted for 78.6% of all food allergies. Children admitted to the PICU were significantly more likely to report food allergy (p = 0.004) and 3.3 times more likely to report at least one food allergy compared with children admitted to a regular nursing floor, and significantly more likely to report food allergy (p < 0.001) and 7.4 times more likely to report at least one food allergy compared with children seen in the ambulatory setting. Children admitted to either the PICU or the regular nursing floor were significantly more likely be African-American (p < 0.001) and to be younger (p < 0.01) compared with children seen in the ambulatory setting.",
        "In Graves\" disease, thyroid-stimulating antibodies (TSAb) activate the TSH receptor (TSHR) causing hyperthyroidism. Serum polyclonal TSAb are difficult to study because of their extremely low serum levels.\n\nOur objective was to determine whether monoclonal TSAb possess characteristics previously reported for polyclonal autoantibodies in Graves\" sera.\n\nWe studied monoclonal TSAb from three laboratories: six generated from mice with induced hyperthyroidism; and one, M22, a human autoantibody obtained from Graves\" B cells.\n\nAll TSAb with one exception were potent activators of TSHR-mediated cAMP generation, with relatively similar half-maximal stimulatory concentrations. Like polyclonal autoantibodies, monoclonal TSAb were largely neutralized by conformationally \"active\" (but not \"inactive\") recombinant TSHR A subunits (the N-terminal cleavage product of the TSHR). Chimeric substitutions of TSHR amino acids 25-30 (the extreme N terminus after removal of the 21 residue signal peptide) abrogated the binding and function of all monoclonal TSAb but with one antibody (TSAb4) revealing a nonidentical epitope. Remarkably, these residues are uninvolved in the M22 epitope determined by x-ray analysis. Finally, flow-cytometric dose-response analyses, not previously possible with polyclonal TSAb, revealed that all monoclonal TSAb, human and murine, bound with lower affinity to their in vivo target, the TSH-holoreceptor, than to the isolated TSHR ectodomain.",
        "Distinguishing small cell epithelial malignancies of the sinonasal cavity and nasopharynx is difficult due to overlapping morphologic characteristics, particularly in small biopsies. This distinction is important, however, because of the inherent differences in biology, natural history, prognosis, and treatment among these neoplasms. The aim of this study is to identify a limited immunohistochemical panel that may help to differentiate these morphologically similar small cell epithelial malignancies.\n\nWe reviewed 37 cases of histologically similar small cell epithelial malignancies of the sinonasal cavity and nasopharynx: nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) (16), basaloid squamous cell carcinoma (BSCC) (15), and high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma (HGNEC) (6) obtained at Jackson Memorial Hospital/UM Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center between 2003 and 2007. Immunohistochemistry for pancytokeratin (CK), CK5/6, p63, and HLA-DR was performed using the labeled streptavidin-biotin method.\n\nAll cases in this study were positive for CK and p63. The CK staining pattern of HGNEC was characteristically dot-like whereas the remaining tumors stained with strong and diffuse cytoplasmic membrane positivity. Likewise, the p63 staining pattern of HGNEC was focal and weak whereas the remaining tumors stained with diffuse and strong nuclear positivity. Immunohistochemistry for HLA-DR was positive in all cases of NPC, whereas BSCC and HGNEC were uniformly negative. Cases of NPC and BSCC were positive for CK5/6 whereas cases of HGNEC were negative.",
        "Oxidative stress (OS) and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) are accepted as non-classical cardiovascular risk factors in end-stage renal disease patients. To clarify the role of these factors in the atherosclerotic process, we investigated if OS and ADMA are associated with endothelial function (EF) in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients.\n\nFifty-two non-diabetic PD patients without known atherosclerotic disease as well as 30 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals were included. We measured serum thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), malondialdehyde (MDA), advanced glycation end-product (AGE), pentosidine, advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), ADMA and EF as described by Celermejer et al. in all subjects.\n\nTBARS, MDA, AOPP, AGE, pentosidine and ADMA levels were significantly higher in PD patients than in controls (P < 0.001). Flow-mediated dilatation (FMD)% and nitrate mediated dilatation (NMD)% in PD patients were lower than in the control group (7.7 +/- 4.0% vs 11.70 +/- 5.50%, P < 0.01 and 17.6 +/- 8.3% vs 26.4 +/- 4.6%, P < 0.01). Additionally, it was found that AOPP are independently correlated with FMD% and NMD% in PD patients (beta = -463, P < 0.01 and beta = -420, P < 0.05).",
        "Evidence is contradictory whether very low-birth-weight (VLBW, birth weight <1500 g) infants with early neutropenia (NP), especially those born to mothers with preeclampsia experience a greater incidence of nosocomial infection (NI).\n\nTo investigate whether NP within the first 7 days of life is a risk factor for NI in VLBW infants.\n\nOver a 42-month period, we identified all VLBW infants born at <or=34 weeks gestation who survived for more than 72 h. Infants who had no evidence of early infection, who had at least one complete blood count performed in the first week of life, and who were not given prophylactic recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) were included in this retrospective study. Early NP was defined as an absolute neutrophil count less than 1500 per microl at any time during the first week of life. NI was defined as the culture of a bacterial or fungal pathogen from a sterile body fluid that was obtained after 72 h of life in an infant with one or more clinical signs of infection.\n\nA total of 338 VLBW infants were reviewed. Of those, 51 infants were excluded because of death or onset of an infection before 72 h of age, lack of a complete blood count in the first week of life or treatment with rhG-CSF. Of the remaining 287 infants, NI occurred in 11 of 77 (14.3%) infants with early NP compared to 42 of 210 (20.0%) infants without early NP (P=0.31). Infants who developed NI were smaller and less mature, had lower Apgar scores, were more frequently instrumented with central lines and required a longer duration of parenteral nutrition compared to infants without NI. Infants with NI also had a higher mortality and a greater incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis, severe intraventricular hemorrhage and threshold retinopathy of prematurity. However, using stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis, only the duration of parenteral nutrition and gestational age were significant risk factors for NI.",
        "Bacterial infection combined with hypotension results in exacerbation of the inflammatory response with release of interferon (IFN) gamma. This excessive inflammation may lead to development of hepatic damage and liver failure. This study investigates the effect of dietary lipids on release of IFN-gamma and development of hepatic damage following exposure to synthetic bacterial DNA (CpG-ODN) and hemorrhagic shock.\n\nRats were exposed to CpG-ODN 18h before hemorrhagic shock. Samples were taken 4h following shock. High-fat nutrition was administered at 18h, 2h and 45min before induction of shock.\n\nEnteral high-fat strongly reduced circulating IFN-gamma (0.2ng/ml, P<0.01) following exposure to CpG-ODN and hemorrhagic shock compared with fasted rats (2.7ng/ml). Concomitantly, plasma L-FABP was reduced (437+/-22ng/ml, P<0.01), and F-actin distribution was preserved. Furthermore, high-fat nutrition reduced apoptosis in the liver and preserved expression of the hepatoprotective protein ABIN-1. Interestingly, administration of anti-IFN-gamma antibodies was associated with reduced expression of ABIN-1.",
        "Solar lentigines (SL) are frequent benign skin lesions appearing on sun-exposed areas especially in elderly people and therefore represent a hallmark of (photo)aged skin. It has been proposed that SL may subsequently evolve into adenoid seborrhoeic keratosis (SK). However, little is known about the genetic basis of SL. In human SK, FGFR3 and PIK3CA mutations have recently been identified.\n\nTo analyse SL for potential FGFR3 and PIK3CA mutations.\n\nWe screened 30 SL for FGFR3 mutations using a SNaPshot multiplex assay. For PIK3CA mutations we used direct sequencing of exon 9 and a SNaPshot assay for the H1047R hotspot mutation (exon 20). Because psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) lentigines show the V600E BRAF hotspot mutation, we additionally investigated this mutation in SL by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction.\n\nFGFR3 mutations were detected in five of 30 (17%) SL and PIK3CA mutations in two of 28 (7%) SL. None of 28 SL available for BRAF analysis revealed the V600E mutation.",
        "Severity in psoriasis and atopic dermatitis (AD) is commonly assessed with the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) and the SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD), respectively. Until today no serum marker is available to reflect the clinical scoring in both diseases. As mast cells play an important role in the pathogenesis of early psoriasis and AD, tryptase, a major compound of mast cell granules that is released upon activation, could in principle serve as such a marker.\n\nTo assess the correlation between serum tryptase and severity of psoriasis and AD as well as the correlation between total IgE levels and severity of AD.\n\nSerum samples from patients hospitalized for psoriasis and AD were collected at time of admission and time of discharge from hospital. PASI and SCORAD assessments were performed at the same time points. Outpatients presenting with naevi and other benign noninflammatory skin lesions served as control group. Serum tryptase values and total IgE levels of patients with AD were measured using a fluoroenzyme immunoassay technique.\n\nNo correlation of serum tryptase level with either the severity of psoriasis or the severity of AD was seen. Total IgE levels in patients with AD at time of admission and discharge from hospital remained the same.",
        "17-(demethoxy), 17-allylamino geldanamycin (17-AAG) suppresses growth in some cancers by inhibiting Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). We examined the effects of 17-AAG-mediated Hsp90 inhibition on human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) growth in vitro and in vivo.\n\nHuman HCC cell lines, Hep3B and HuH7, were exposed to 17-AAG and cell viabilities and apoptosis were determined. Cell cycle profiles were analyzed and the G(2)/M cell cycle checkpoint proteins cdc2 and cyclin B1 were examined. Studies were performed to determine whether 17-AAG-mediated cdc2 decrease was due to altered gene expression, transcription, or protein degradation. The effects of 17-AAG on Hep3B and HuH7 xenograft growth in athymic nude mice were also examined.\n\nHep3B and HuH7 treated with 17-AAG versus untreated controls showed decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis. Cells treated with 17-AAG also showed an increased fraction in G(2)/M phase and an associated decrease in cdc2 through protein degradation rather than through other mechanisms. Hsp90 inhibition by 17-AAG also decreased HCC xenograft growth in association with decreased cdc2 expression.",
        "Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is the major endotoxin signalling receptor of the innate immune system and is required for efficient recognition of bacterial infections. Here, we analysed a possible association between the TLR4 variant Asp299Gly and disease outcome in children with invasive meningococcal disease.\n\nIn total, 197 children with invasive meningococcal disease were analysed for the TLR4 Asp299Gly variant. Genotyping results were correlated with mortality, the frequency of ventilation support, application of inotropic substances, skin grafting, and limb loss.\n\nThe overall Asp299Gly allele frequency was 9.4%. Detection of a heterozygous Asp299Gly TLR4 mutation was significantly associated with fatal outcome (non-survivor group: 31.6% vs. survivor group: 12.1%; p = 0.021) and was even more pronounced in patients with disease onset less than 24 months of age (non-survivor group: 42.8% vs. survivor group: 10.2%; p = 0.006). In this age group, ventilation support was also more frequent in patients with the Asp299Gly genotype (37.5% vs. 6.2%).",
        "Coherent averaging is a technique to recover the response to repetitively applied stimuli when that response is embedded in random noise. We derived novel indices for left ventricular dyssynchrony estimation from volume-catheter signals using coherent averaging procedure: mechanical dyssynchrony (DYSCoh) internal flow fraction (IFFCoh) and mechanical dispersion (DISPCoh). The percentage power of non-repetitive components in the volume signals (ResTotAvg) was also estimated. The aims of the study were to evaluate the indices, characterizing repetitive and non-recurrent components of the conductance-volume signals, and to assess the ability of these indices to detect the changes in dyssynchrony induced by biventricular pacing (BIV).\n\nWe compared the results obtained in 20 heart failure patients indicated to BIV (HF Group) during spontaneous conduction with the results from 12 patients with preserved ventricular function (non-HF Group), and with those obtained during BIV.\n\nDISPCoh and ResTotAvg were significantly different in HF compared to non-HF group, and identified HF patients with high accuracy (area under curve at ROC analysis > 0.8). These indices also demonstrated significant differences after BIV (p = 0.047 and p = 0.037 respectively) and their baseline values correlated with the acute increase of stroke volume (r = 0.64 and r = 0.78, both with p < 0.005).",
        "Trypanosomes mostly control gene expression by post-transcriptional events such as modulation of mRNA stability and translational efficiency. These mechanisms involve RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), which associate with transcripts to form messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes.\n\nIn this study, we report the identification of mRNA targets for Trypanosoma cruzi U-rich RBP 1 (TcUBP1) and T. cruzi RBP 3 (TcRBP3), two phylogenetically conserved proteins among Kinetoplastids. Co-immunoprecipitated RBP-associated RNAs were extracted from mRNP complexes and binding of RBPs to several targets was confirmed by independent experimental assays. Analysis of target transcript sequences allowed the identification of different signature RNA motifs for each protein. Cis-elements for RBP binding have a stem-loop structure of 30-35 bases and are more frequently represented in the 3\"-untranslated region (UTR) of mRNAs. Insertion of the correctly folded RNA elements to a non-specific mRNA rendered it into a target transcript, whereas substitution of the RNA elements abolished RBP interaction. In addition, RBPs competed for RNA-binding sites in accordance with the distribution of different and overlapping motifs in the 3\"-UTRs of common mRNAs.",
        "Standard haemostasis screening tests are performed to reveal unknown congenital or acquired disturbances of plasma and/or platelet haemostasis. Since their diagnostic efficacy is often low, routinely performed haemostasis testing has been questioned. We investigated whether preoperatively assessed haemostasis testing can be used to predict the requirement of blood products.\n\nWe retrospectively assessed haemostasis parameters including platelet function testing by PFA 100 as well as the numbers of red blood cell (RBC) concentrates, fresh frozen plasmas (FFPs), and platelet concentrates (PCs) that were given peri-operatively and during the first two postoperative days in 2,831 cardiac surgery patients. Logistic regression analyses were used to select those parameters, which could predict blood product requirement.\n\nOf our study cohort, 56.5% needed RBCs, 15% FFPs, and 5% PCs. The need for RBCs was associated with significantly altered pre-operative values of most haemostasis parameters. However, by the use of logistic regression analysis fibrinogen was the only haemostasis parameter that was independently associated with the use of RBCs (odds ratio 1.56; 95% CI: 1.27-1.91; P <0.001). The predictive value of other parameters such as age, body weight, haemoglobin, and haematocrit was however much higher in comparison to fibrinogen (odds ratios: 1.92-3.50; P <0.001). It was not possible to develop a score based on haemostasis parameters to accurately identify patients at risk for RBC use. Moreover, we were unable to estimate the need for FFPs and PCs using preoperative haemostasis testing.",
        "Familial aggregation of intracranial aneurysms (IAs) indicates a genetic role in the pathogenesis of this disease. Despite a number of reported susceptibility loci, no disease-causing gene variants have been identified. In this study, we used a parametric genomewide linkage approach to search for new IA susceptibility loci in a large Caucasian family.\n\nThe affection status of family members with clinical signs of IA was confirmed with medical records or through radiological or surgical examinations. All other relatives were screened using MR angiography. Genomewide linkage analysis was performed on 35 subjects using approximately 250 000 single nucleotide polymorphic markers.\n\nTen individuals had an IA. Linkage analysis using a dominant model showed significant linkage to a 7-cM region in 13q14.12-21.1 with a maximum logarithm of odds score of 4.56.",
        "An important layer of active defense in plant immunity is the detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) mediated by cell-surface receptors. For the establishment of disease, pathogens depend on the ability to overcome PAMP perception and disable plant signaling pathways activated in response to PAMPs. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are therefore prime targets for pathogen effectors. FLS2, its coreceptor BAK1, and EFR encode receptor-like kinases that play a role in immunity against bacterial pathogens.\n\nHere, we report that virulence of Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000 (PtoDC3000) in Arabidopsis is enhanced through the action of its effector AvrPtoB, which promotes degradation of FLS2. We show that AvrPtoB, through its N terminus, associates with FLS2 and BAK1, of which interaction with FLS2 is enhanced by flg22 activation. In vitro, AvrPtoB is active as an E3 ligase to catalyze polyubiquitination of the kinase domain of FLS2, a process confirmed in planta. Full enhancement of PtoDC3000 virulence appears to require the E3 ligase activity of AvrPtoB.",
        "An important contributing factor to the success of terrestrial flowering plants in colonizing the land was the evolution of a developmental strategy, termed skotomorphogenesis, whereby postgerminative seedlings emerging from buried seed grow vigorously upward in the subterranean darkness toward the soil surface.\n\nHere we provide genetic evidence that a central component of the mechanism underlying this strategy is the collective repression of premature photomorphogenic development in dark-grown seedlings by several members of the phytochrome (phy)-interacting factor (PIF) subfamily of bHLH transcription factors (PIF1, PIF3, PIF4, and PIF5). Conversely, evidence presented here and elsewhere collectively indicates that a significant component of the mechanism by which light initiates photomorphogenesis upon first exposure of dark-grown seedlings to irradiation involves reversal of this repression by rapid reduction in the abundance of these PIF proteins, through degradation induced by direct interaction of the photoactivated phy molecule with the transcription factors.",
        "The longitudinal relationship between aerobic exercise and left ventricular (LV) mass in hypertension is not well known. We did a prospective study to investigate the long-term effect of regular physical activity on development of LV hypertrophy (LVH) in a cohort of young subjects screened for Stage 1 hypertension.\n\nWe assessed 454 subjects whose physical activity status was consistent during the follow-up. Echocardiographic LV mass was measured at entry, every 5 years, and/or at the time of hypertension development before starting treatment. LVH was defined as an LV mass >/=50 g/m(2.7) in men and >/=47 g/m(2.7) in women. During a median follow-up of 8.3 years, 32 subjects developed LVH (sedentary, 10.3%; active, 1.7%, P = 0.000). In a logistic regression, physically active groups combined (n = 173) were less likely to develop LVH than sedentary group with a crude OR = 0.15 (CI, 0.05-0.52). After controlling for sex, age, family history for hypertension, hypertension duration, body mass, blood pressure, baseline LV mass, lifestyle factors, and follow-up length, the OR was 0.24 (CI, 0.07-0.85). Blood pressure declined over time in physically active subjects (-5.1 +/- 17.0/-0.5 +/- 10.2 mmHg) and slightly increased in their sedentary peers (0.0 +/- 15.3/0.9 +/- 9.7 mmHg, adjusted P vs. active = 0.04/0.06). Inclusion of changes in blood pressure over time into the logistic model slightly decreased the strength of the association between physical activity status and LVH development (OR = 0.25, CI, 0.07-0.87).",
        "The apical junctional complex (AJC) is a dynamic structure responsible to maintain epithelial cell-cell adhesions and it plays important functions such as, polarity, mechanical integrity, and cell signaling. Alteration of this complex during pathological events leads to an impaired epithelial barrier by perturbation of the cell-cell adhesion system. Although clinical and experimental data indicate that prostaglandin E(2) (PGE2) plays a critical function in promoting cell motility and cancer progression, little is known concerning its role in AJC disassembly, an event that takes place at the beginning of colorectal tumorigenesis. Using Caco-2 cells, a cell line derived from human colorectal cancer, we investigated the effects of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) treatment on AJC assembly and function.\n\nExposition of Caco-2 cells to PGE(2) promoted differential alteration of AJC protein distribution, as evidenced by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting analysis and impairs the barrier function, as seen by a decrease in the transepithelial electric resistance and an increase in the permeability to ruthenium red marker. We demonstrated the involvement of EP1 and EP2 prostaglandin E(2) receptor subtypes in the modulation of the AJC disassembly caused by prostanoid. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of protein kinase-C, but not PKA and p38MAPK significantly prevented the PGE(2) effects on the AJC disassembly.",
        "The CD34+ cell content is a predictive factor for engraftment and survival after umbilical cord blood (UCB) transplantation. The high variability in the CD34 assay results in different recommended cell doses for infusion across transplant centers and also limits the clinical utility of the CD34+ cell counts provided by cord blood banks (CBBs). This bi-institutional study was intended to understand the sources of this variability.\n\nThe level of CD34 agreement between the University of Minnesota (UM) and the Madrid CBB (MCBB) was evaluated on 50 UCB units before and after cryopreservation. Two cryopreserved vials per unit were thawed and processed at both laboratories. Dual-platform ISHAGE-based flow cytometry was used for CD34 enumeration.\n\nPostthaw nucleated cell recoveries were similar. However, whereas CD34+ cell enumeration before freezing was 0.35 +/- 0.22 percent, the results after thawing were 0.98 +/- 0.65 and 0.57 +/- 0.39 percent at UM and MCBB, respectively. Bland-Altman plots analysis ruled out the interchangeability of MCBB and UM CD34 values. Differences in the initial cell acquisition settings accounted for most of the CD34 discrepancy, which was no longer present after normalization of the forward scatter threshold for cell acquisition.",
        "Demyelinating events in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) can involve several locations in the central nervous system. We sought to determine if initial clinical demyelinating event (IDE) location predicts subsequent clinical relapse locations in early RRMS.\n\nWe identified all RRMS patients from two large MS clinics who were seen within 1 year of disease onset. Logistic regression was performed with the outcome defined as the second or third exacerbation location and the predictor defined as IDE+/-second event location.\n\n195 patients with at least two clinical exacerbations were identified. There was an increased odds of a patient\"s second relapse occurring in the spinal cord if the IDE was in the spinal cord (odds ratio (OR) = 3.79, 95% CI 2.06 to 7.00, p<0.001). There was more than a sixfold increase in the odds of a patient\"s second relapse occurring in the optic nerve if the IDE was in the optic nerve (OR = 6.18, 95% CI 2.90 to 13.18, p<0.001). These associations remained similar after adjusting for treatment and patient characteristics. If the IDE and second event were both in the same location (spinal cord, optic nerve or brainstem/cerebellum), the third event was likely to remain in that location.",
        "The present study evaluated the clinical efficacy and pharmacokinetics of microemulsion cyclosporine A (ME-CyA) with modification from postprandial to preprandial administration in adult patients with refractory nephrotic syndrome.\n\nWe investigated 19 patients with refractory nephrotic syndrome who had been switched from the postprandial administration of ME-CyA to preprandial administration. The pharmacokinetics of ME-CyA were also evaluated before and 6 months after switching from postprandial to preprandial administration by serial measurement of the blood CyA concentration in 10 patients.\n\nThis study showed that 16 of 19 patients (84%) displayed an improvement in their clinical condition or continued to maintain remission after switching from post- to preprandial administration. In particular among 14 patients with minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS) in this study, 13 patients maintained or achieved remission under preprandial ME-CyA administration. Only three of 10 patients with postprandial administration showed a peak concentration> 500 ng/ml within 1-2 h after administration, while with preprandial administration, nine of 10 patients showed this good absorption profiles. This effectiveness of preprandial administration seems to be dependent on the improved pharmacokinetics with the increase of area under the curve from 0-4 h (AUC(0-4)) and peak concentration. There were no statistical differences in the mean daily doses of ME-CyA between both administration periods. No ME-CyA-induced nephrotoxicity or other harmful events were encountered throughout the study.",
        "Geldanamycin and its analogues belong to a new class of anticancer agents that inhibit the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90. We hypothesized that membrane transporters expressed on tumor cells may contribute at least in part to cellular sensitivity to these agents. The purpose of this study is to identify novel transporters as determinant for sensitivity and resistance to geldanamycins.\n\nTo facilitate a systematic study of chemosensitivity across multiple geldanamycin analogues, we correlated mRNA expression profiles of majority of transporters with anticancer drug activities in 60 human tumor cell lines (NCI-60). We subsequently validated the gene-drug correlations using cytotoxicity and transport assays.\n\nThe GA analogues displayed negative correlations with mRNA expression levels of the multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1, ABCC1). Suppressing MRP1 efflux using the inhibitor MK-571 and small interfering RNA in cell lines with intrinsic and acquired MRP1 overexpression (A549 and HL-60/ADR) and in cell lines stably transduced with MRP1 (MCF7/MRP1) increased intracellular drug accumulation and increased tumor cell sensitivity to geldanamycin analogues.",
        "To investigate the effects of candesartan, an angiotension II type I receptor antagonist, in improvement of insulin resistance (IR) induced by high-fat diet and the possible mechanism thereof.\n\n45 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: normal chow group (NC, n = 15) fed with normal diet, high fat diet group (HF, n = 15) fed with high fat diet, and high-fat diet with daily candesartan treatment group (HF + C, n = 15) fed with high fat diet and given orally with candesartan 8 mg/kg per day. Body weight was measured regularly. Four weeks later, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp technique were performed to estimate the insulin sensitivity. After 12 h fasting blood samples were collected from the abdominal aorta to test the contents of blood glucose, and serum triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), LDL, HDL, and free fatty acid (FFA). Radioimmunoassay was used to detect the serum insulin. Viscera were taken out. Immunohistochemistry was used to examine the expression of peroxisome proliferation activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma in hepatic and adipose tissues.\n\nThe body weight 16 weeks later of the HF group was significantly higher than that of the HF + C group (P < 0.01). The liver weight and epididymal and peri-renal fat weights of the HF group were all significantly higher than those of the HF + C group and NC group (all P < 0.01). There was no significant difference in fasting blood sugar among these 3 groups (P > 0.05). The glucose levels 2 h after OGTT in the HF + C group was (6.3 +/- 0.5) mmol/L, significantly lower than that of the HF group [(7.3 +/- 1.2) mmol/L, P < 0.01]. The glucose infusion rate (GIR) of the HF + C group was (22 +/- 5) mmol/L, significantly higher than that of the HF group [(14 +/- 4) mmol/L, P < 0.01]. The PPARgamma expression levels in liver and adipose tissue of the HF + C group were up-regulated significantly compared with those of the HF group.",
        "Cerebral regional oxygen saturation (rSO(2)) measured with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has a well-proven clinical utility. A goal-oriented treatment based on the rSO(2) resulted in a significant reduction in major morbidity and in a shortening of postoperative hospital stay in patients undergoing coronary revascularization. In this study, we have compared the values of superior vena cava saturation (ScvO(2)) continuously measured with a Pediasat catheter and the corresponding NIRS rSO(2) values obtained during cardiac operations in pediatric patients.\n\nThis was a prospective observational study enrolling fifteen pediatric patients (age: 6 days-7 years) undergoing cardiac operations. ScvO(2) data obtained with the Pediasat during the operation were compared with simultaneously recorded NIRS rSO(2) values.\n\nOne hundred and seventeen matched sets of data were obtained during the operation. ScvO(2) continuously measured with the Pediasat was significantly correlated with the corresponding NIRS rSO(2) values. However, there was a constant positive bias (ScvO(2) values were higher than NIRS rSO(2) values) of 5.6%, with a precision of 10.4%. Time-related percentage changes of NIRS rSO(2) were significantly correlated with the corresponding ScvO(2) percentage changes. A decrease in ScvO(2) is predictive for a decrease in rSO(2) with a sensitivity of 73.7% and a specificity of 85.7%.",

With Fe(III), 3-MI and 4-MP levels increased significantly to 138 +/- 15.8 and 187 +/- 14.0 micromol l(-1), respectively. Clostridium scatologenes cultured in brain-heart infusion medium amended with (10 mmol l(-1)) Na(2)SO(4), KNO(3), MnO(2) or Fe(III), resulted in only Fe(III) significantly increasing 3-MI (1308 micromol l(-1)) and 4-MP (367 micromol l(-1)) levels. In semi-defined medium, Fe(III) alone and Fe(III) + L-tryptophan (1 mmol l(-1)) resulted in a 1.85-fold and 15.6-fold increase in 3-MI levels over L-tryptophan alone, respectively. Fe(III) alone and Fe(III) + L-tyrosine (1 mmol l(-1)) caused a 4.4-fold and 22.9-fold increase in 4-MP levels over tyrosine alone, respectively. Fe(III) did not increase growth of Cl. scatologenes.",
        "3-Methylindole (3-MI) is a degradation product of L-tryptophan and is both an animal waste malodorant and threat to ruminant health. Culture conditions influencing 3-MI production in Clostridium scatologenes ATCC 25775 were investigated.\n\nExtracellular 3-MI levels in cells cultured in brain heart infusion (BHI) medium (pH 7.0) at 33 degrees C and 37 degrees C for 72 h were 907 +/- 38 and 834 +/- 121 micromol l(-1), respectively. Cells cultured in tryptone-yeast (TY) extract medium at 37 degrees C for 48 h produced 104 +/- 86 micromol l(-1) 3-MI; however, addition of 1 mmol l(-1) L-tryptophan failed to increase extracellular levels (113 +/- 50 micromol l(-1) 3-MI). Specific activity of indole acetic acid decarboxylase measured in BHI, TY and TY plus 1 mmol l(-1) tryptophan-grown cells displayed 35-, 33- and 76-fold higher levels than in semi-defined medium-grown cells.",
        "Current s.c. allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT) leads to amelioration of IgE-mediated allergy, but it requires numerous allergen injections over several years and is frequently associated with severe side-effects. The aim of this study was to test whether modified recombinant allergens can improve therapeutic efficacy in SIT while reducing allergic side-effects.\n\nThe major cat allergen Fel d 1 was fused to a TAT-derived protein translocation domain and to a truncated invariant chain for targeting the MHC class II pathway (MAT-Fel d 1). The immunogenicity was evaluated in mice, while potential safety issues were assessed by cellular antigen stimulation test (CAST) using basophils from cat-dander-allergic patients.\n\nMAT-Fel d 1 enhanced induction of Fel d 1-specific IgG2a antibody responses as well as the secretion of IFN-gamma and IL-2 from T cells. Subcutaneous allergen-specific immunotherapy of mice using the modified Fel d 1 provided stronger protection against anaphylaxis than SIT with unmodified Fel d 1, and MAT-Fel d 1 caused less degranulation of human basophils than native Fel d 1.",
        "Regular physical activity is vital for maintaining the health and independence of older people. Few objective data exist on the effect of weather on physical activity levels in this group. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of weather using an objective measure of physical activity.\n\nThis was a retrospective study of 127 participants, >65 years old, who were enrolled in a previous randomised controlled trial. The main outcome was daily activity counts measured using the RT3 triaxial accelerometer over 1-week periods. These were correlated with local weather data including daily maximum temperature, sunshine, precipitation and wind speed that were obtained from the metrological office.\n\nThe mean age of the subjects was 78.6 years; 90/127 were female; and 720 usable daily counts were obtained for the 127 participants. The mean daily counts showed a striking seasonal variation, with maximum activity in June and minimum in February (137 557 vs 65 010 counts per day, p<0.001). Day length, mean maximum temperature and mean daily sunshine were able to explain 72.9% of the monthly variance in daily activity levels. Daily counts showed moderate correlation with day length (r = 0.358, p<0.001), maximum temperature (r = 0.345, p<0.001), duration of sunshine (r = 0.313, p<0.001) and rain (r = -0.098, p = 0.008) but not with wind speed (r = 0.093, p = 0.12). Multivariate analysis showed that day length, sunshine duration and maximum temperature were independent predictors of daily activity (adjusted R(2) = 0.16).",
        "Motor proteins from the kinesin-5 subfamily play an essential role in spindle assembly during cell division of most organisms. These motors crosslink and slide microtubules in the spindle. Kinesin-5 motors are phosphorylated at a conserved site by Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) during mitosis. Xenopus laevis kinesin-5 has also been reported to be phosphorylated by Aurora A in vitro.\n\nWe investigate here the effect of these phosphorylations on kinesin-5 from Xenopus laevis, called Eg5. We find that phosphorylation at threonine 937 in the C-terminal tail of Eg5 by Cdk1 does not affect the velocity of Eg5, but strongly increases its binding to microtubules assembled in buffer. Likewise, this phosphorylation promotes binding of Eg5 to microtubules in Xenopus egg extract spindles. This enhancement of binding elevates the amount of Eg5 in spindles above a critical level required for bipolar spindle formation. We find furthermore that phosphorylation of Xenopus laevis Eg5 by Aurora A at serine 543 in the stalk is not required for spindle formation.",
        "The long-term prognostic significance of elevated cardiac markers in an undifferentiated patient population with chest pain is unknown.\n\nSerum troponin I (cTnI), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), and myoglobin were measured at presentation in 951 consecutive patients evaluated in the emergency department for possible acute coronary syndrome, and all-cause mortality was measured over 5 years.\n\nFinal diagnoses included myocardial infarction in 70 (7.4%), unstable angina in 78 (8.2%), stable angina in 26 (2.7%), heart failure in 135 (14.2%), syncope in 61 (6.4%), arrhythmia in 62 (6.5%), and noncardiac diagnoses in 519 (54.6%). Our study population had a mean (+/-SD) age of 63 (+/-16), 434 (46%) were male, 774 (81%) were African American, 408 (43%) had known coronary artery disease, 647 (68%) had hypertension, 244 (26%) had diabetes mellitus, and 237 (25%) had a serum creatinine>or=1.5 mg/dL. At 5 years, there were 349 (36.7%) deaths. In a multivariate model with adjustment for baseline covariates, an elevated cTnI>or=1.0 ng/mL (hazard ratio [HR] 1.7, 95% CI 1.3-2.3) and myoglobin>or=200 ng/mL (HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.1), but not CK-MB>or=9.0 ng/mL (HR 0.9, 95% CI 0.6-1.3), remained independent predictors of all-cause mortality.

        "Evidence is growing that some patients are not responsive to the antithrombotic action of aspirin. We prospectively evaluated the ability of aspirin resistance status, determined by PFA-100, to predict new thrombotic events in patients with stable ischemic cerebrovascular disease.\n\nWe studied 129 consecutive patients with stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA) or vascular cognitive impairment. We assessed relationships between aspirin resistance, risk factors for ischemic cerebrovascular disease, and occurrence of new thrombotic events (composite of stroke, TIA, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death).\n\nAspirin resistance, found in 26 (20.1%) cases, was unrelated to any of the examined vascular risk factors. During mean follow-up of 56 months, new thrombotic events occurred in 19 patients (14.7%), four with aspirin resistance (15.4%) and 15 (14.6%) without aspirin resistance (p=1.00).",
        "The activation of Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway represents a frequent event in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) progression, thus raising the possibility of using specific mTOR inhibitors for the treatment of SCC patients. In this regard, blockade of mTOR with rapamycin prevents the growth of human head and neck SCC cells when xenotransplanted into immunodeficient mice. However, therapeutic responses in xenograft tumors are not always predictive of clinical anticancer activity.\n\nAs genetically defined and chemically induced animal cancer models often reflect better the complexity of the clinical setting, we used here a two-step chemical carcinogenesis model to explore the effectiveness of rapamycin for the treatment of skin SCC.\n\nRapamycin exerted a remarkable anticancer activity in this chemically induced cancer model, decreasing the tumor burden of mice harboring early and advanced tumor lesions, and even recurrent skin SCCs. Immunohistochemical studies on tumor biopsies and clustering analysis revealed that rapamycin causes the rapid decrease in the phosphorylation status of mTOR targets followed by the apoptotic death of cancer cells and the reduction in the growth and metabolic activity of the surviving ones, concomitant with a decrease in the population of cancer cells expressing mutant p53. This approach enabled investigating the relationship among molecular changes caused by mTOR inhibition, thus helping identify relevant biomarkers for monitoring the effectiveness of mTOR inhibition in the clinical setting.",
        "Efficient slow freezing protocols within serum-free and feeder-free culture systems are crucial for the clinical application of human embryonic stem (hES) cells. Frequently, however, hES cells must be cryopreserved as clumps when using conventional slow freezing protocols, leading to lower survival rates during freeze-thaw and limiting their recovery and growth efficiency after thawing, as well as limiting downstream applications that require single cell suspensions. We describe a novel method to increase freeze-thaw survival and proliferation rate of single hES cells in serum-free and feeder-free culture conditions.\n\nhES cells maintained on Matrigel-coated dishes were dissociated into single cells with Accutase and slow freezing. After thawing at 37 degrees C, cells were cultured in mTeSR medium supplemented with 10 microM of Rho-associated kinase inhibitor Y-27632 for 1 day.\n\nThe use of Y-27632 and Accutase significantly increases the survival of single hES cells after thawing compared with a control group (P < 0.01). Furthermore, by treatment of hES cell aggregates with EGTA to disrupt cell-cell interaction, we show that Y-27632 treatment does not directly affect hES cell apoptosis. Even in the presence of Y-27632, hES cells deficient in cell-cell interaction undergo apoptosis. Y-27632-treated freeze-thawed hES cells retain typical morphology, stable karyotype, expression of pluripotency markers and the potential to differentiate into derivatives of all three germ layers after long-term culture.",
        "Core2 1-6-N-glucosaminyltransferase-I (C2GlcNAcT-I) modification of adhesion molecules is required for optimal binding to target ligands. The objective of this study was to determine the role of C2GlcNAcT-I in the recruitment of Ly-6C(hi) monocytes to atherosclerotic lesions and in lesion formation in mice.\n\nIn a whole-blood binding assay, Ly-6C(hi) monocytes and certain lymphocytes and natural killer cells from wild-type mice bound to P- and E-selectin. C2GlcNAcT-I deficiency abrogated leukocyte binding to P- and E-selectin in this assay as well as in an in vitro flow chamber assay. Moreover, C2GlcNAcT-I deficiency decreased Ly-6C(hi) monocyte interactions with atherosclerotic arteries under physiological flow conditions and also inhibited monocyte recruitment to the peritoneal cavity in mice challenged with thioglycollate. In apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE(-/-)) mice, lack of C2GlcNAcT-I resulted in fewer and smaller atherosclerotic lesions in mouse aortas. Atherosclerosis was also suppressed in C2GlcNAcT-I(-/-)/apoE(-/-) chimeric mice transplanted with C2GlcNAcT-I(+/+) bone marrow cells.",
        "The purpose of the study was to determine which of the active constituents of fish oil, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), is most effective in suppressing proinflammatory mediator generation and cytokine expression from LPS-stimulated human asthmatic alveolar macrophages (AMphi).\n\nThe AMphi were obtained from twenty-one asthmatic adults using fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Cells were pretreated with DMEM, pure EPA, an EPA-rich media (45% EPA/10% DHA), pure DHA, a DHA-rich media (10% EPA/50% DHA) or Lipovenos (n-6 PUFA), and then exposed to Dulbecco\"s Modified Eagle\"s Medium (DMEM) (-) or LPS (+). Supernatants were analyzed for leukotriene (LT)B(4), prostaglandin (PG)D(2), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-1beta production. Detection of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta mRNA expression levels was quantified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.\n\n120 microM pure EPA and EPA-rich media significantly (p<0.05) suppressed TNF-alpha and IL-1beta mRNA expression and the production of LTB(4), PGD(2) and TNF-alpha and IL-1beta in LPS-stimulated primary AMphi cells obtained from asthmatic patients to a much greater extent than 120 microM pure DHA and DHA-rich media respectively.",
        "Hepatic myofibroblast apoptosis is critical to resolution of liver fibrosis. We show that human hepatic myofibroblasts co-express p75(NTR) (p75 neurotrophin receptor) and sortilin, thus facilitating differential responses to mature and pro nerve growth factor (proNGF). Although mature NGF is proapoptotic, proNGF protects human hepatic myofibroblasts from apoptosis. Moreover, in recovery from experimental liver fibrosis, the decrease in proNGF parallels loss of hepatic myofibroblasts by apoptosis. Macrophage-derived matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7) cleaves proNGF in a concentration-dependent manner, and its expression in the liver coincides with falling proNGF levels. To define the dominant effect of p75(NTR)-mediated events in experimental liver fibrosis, we have used a mouse lacking the p75(NTR) ligand-binding domain but expressing the intracellular domain. We show that absence of p75(NTR) ligand-mediated signals leads to significantly retarded architectural resolution and reduced hepatic myofibroblast loss by apoptosis. Lack of the ligand-competent p75(NTR) limits hepatocyte and oval cell proliferative capacity in vivo without preventing hepatic stellate cell transdifferentiation.",
        "Recent reports indicate that glycosphingolipids play an important role in regulation of carbohydrate metabolism. We have shown that the iminosugar N-(5\"-adamantane-1\"-yl-methoxy)-pentyl-1-deoxynojirimycin (AMP-DNM), an inhibitor of the enzyme glucosylceramide synthase, is a potent enhancer of insulin signaling in rodent models for insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. In this study, we determined whether AMP-DNM also affects lipid homeostasis and, in particular, the reverse cholesterol transport pathway. Treatment of C57BL/6J mice with AMP-DNM for 5 weeks decreased plasma levels of triglycerides and cholesterol by 35%, whereas neutral sterol excretion increased twofold. Secretion of biliary lipid also increased twofold, which resulted in a similar rise in bile flow. This effect was not due to altered expression levels or kinetics of the various export pumps involved in bile formation. However, the bile salt pool size increased and the expression of Cyp7A1 was up-regulated. In vitro experiments using HepG2 hepatoma cell line revealed this to be due to inhibition of fibroblast growth factor-19 (FGF19)-mediated suppression of Cyp7A1 via the FGF receptor.",

Three hundred and thirty-six patients (70.3%) were community dwellers before the fracture and 159 (29.7%) were admitted from nursing homes.\n\nThe fast-track treatment and care program included a switch from systemic opiates to a local femoral nerve catheter block; an earlier assessment by the anesthesiologist; and a more-systematic approach to nutrition, fluid and oxygen therapy, and urinary retention.\n\nIn the intervention group, the rate of any in-hospital postoperative complication was reduced from 33% to 20% (odds ratio=0.61, 95% confidence interval=0.4-0.9; P=.002). Rates of confusion (P=.02), pneumonia (P=.03), and urinary tract infection (P<.001) were lower in the intervention group than in the control group, and length of stay was 15.8 days in the control group, versus 9.7 days in the intervention group (P<.001). For community dwellers, 12-month mortality was 23% in the control group versus 12% in the intervention group (P=.02).

        "Lifestyle intervention with diet modification and increase in physical activity is effective for reducing hepatic steatosis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, for a similar weight loss, there is a large variability in the change in liver fat. We hypothesised that cardiorespiratory fitness may predict the response to the intervention.\n\nLongitudinal study with increase in physical activity and diet modification.\n\nUniversity teaching hospital.\n\n50 adults with NAFLD and 120 controls at risk for metabolic diseases.\n\nTotal-, subcutaneous abdominal- and visceral adipose tissue by magnetic resonance tomography, liver fat by 1HMR spectroscopy and cardiorespiratory fitness (VO(2,max)) by a maximal cycle exercise test at baseline and after 9 months of follow-up.\n\nIn all subjects total-, subcutaneous abdominal- and visceral adipose tissue decreased and fitness increased (all p<0.0001) during the intervention. The most pronounced changes were found for liver fat (-31%, p<0.0001). Among the parameters predicting the change in liver fat, fitness at baseline emerged as the strongest factor, independently of total- and visceral adipose tissue as well as exercise intensity (p = 0.005). In the group of subjects with NAFLD at baseline, a resolution of NAFLD was found in 20 individuals. For 1 standard deviation increase in VO(2,max) at baseline the odds ratio for resolution of NAFLD was 2.79 (95% confidence interval, 1.43-6.33).",

Potential predictors of post-ICU mortality were considered at 3 levels: admission status, procedures and therapy during the ICU stay, and status at ICU discharge.\n\nOf the 3147 patients included in the Sepsis Occurrence in Acutely Ill Patients study, 1729 (54.9%) were discharged to the general floor (study group) and 125 of these died (overall post-ICU hospital mortality rate, 4%); 26 (20.8%) died already the first day on the floor. Nonsurvivors were older, had higher incidence of hematologic cancer and cirrhosis, and greater Simplified Acute Physiology Score II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score on ICU admission; they were also more likely to have been admitted for medical reasons than survivors. In a multivariate forward stepwise logistic regression analysis, age, hematologic cancer, cirrhosis, simplified acute physiology score II on admission, medical admission, sepsis at any time during ICU stay, and organ dysfunction at ICU discharge were all independently associated with a greater risk of post-ICU death.",
        "NK1.1(+) TCRalphabeta(int) CD1-restricted T (NKT) cells are a unique subset of T lymphocytes that are believed to have an immunoregulatory role in a wide range of diseases. Most mouse NKT cells express a T-cell receptor that contains an invariant Valpha14Jalpha18 chain and recognizes antigenic glycolipids presented in association with major histocompatibility complex class Ib (CD1d) molecules. These invariant NKT (iNKT) cells have been implicated in cholestatic liver injury.\n\nWe examined the role of iNKT cells in liver injury associated with biliary obstruction in mice with ligations of the common bile duct.\n\nThe number of activated iNKT cells increased markedly in the livers of mice following bile duct ligation. Plasma alanine aminotransferase levels, an indicator of liver injury, were significantly higher in iNKT cell-deficient (Jalpha18(-/-)) mice compared with wild-type mice following bile duct ligation. Photo image analysis of histologic sections confirmed that more damage was present in the livers of Jalpha18(-/-) mice; liver damage correlated with increases in keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC) and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) production as well as neutrophil sequestration. Liver injury was significantly reduced in Jalpha18(-/-) mice treated with anti-KC and anti-MIP-2 or rendered neutrophil deficient before bile duct ligation. Similarly, Jalpha18(-/-) mice that were injected with iNKT cells before bile duct ligation exhibited significant decreases in neutrophil accumulation and liver damage.",
        "Recently, a polymorphism in the NOS1AP gene (rs10494366), a regulator of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), was associated with QTc prolongation. Both nNOS and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) regulate intracellular calcium levels and have an important role in cardiovascular homeostasis. The aim was to investigate whether this polymorphism is associated with cardiovascular mortality in users of CCBs.\n\nThe data from the Rotterdam study, a population-based closed cohort study of Caucasian individuals of > or =55 years of age, were used. We identified 1113 participants in the Rotterdam Study who were prescribed CCBs for the first time between 1991 and 2005. All-cause and cardiovascular mortality was assessed in participants who were prescribed CCBs with different NOS1AP rs10494366 genotypes using Cox proportional hazard models.\n\nIn participants starting on dihydropyridine CCBs (amlodipine, nifedipine and others) all-cause mortality (n = 79) risks were higher in participants with the TG [hazard ratio (HR) 2.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24, 5.34] or the GG genotype (HR 3.18, 95% CI 1.18, 8.58) than in participants with the referent TT genotype.

        "Liver regeneration following partial hepatectomy requires the orchestration of highly regulated molecular pathways; a change in the abundance or activity of a specific gene product has the potential to adversely affect this process. The nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) transcription factors represent a family of gene transcription signaling intermediates that translate receptor-dependent signaling events into specific transcriptional responses using the Ras/Raf pathway.\n\nEight-week old NFAT4 knockout (KO) mice and their wild type counterparts (Balb-c) underwent two-thirds partial hepatectomy. The animals were sacrificed and their livers were harvested at specific time points during regeneration. Recovery of liver mass was measured for each time point. PCR analysis was used to analyze expression levels of the immediate early genes c-fos, c-jun and c-myc as well as downstream effectors of NFAT4 including FGF-18 and BMP-4.\n\nHepatocyte proliferation and thus liver regeneration following hepatectomy was suppressed in NFAT4 knockout (KO) mice. Statistical significance was reached at 1 h, 7 d, and 10 d (P < 0.05) with a 22% median reduction in regeneration of liver mass in the NFAT4 KO mice by 10 d, at which time liver regeneration should be complete in mice. The immediate early gene c-fos was elevated in NFAT4 KO mice during early regeneration with a median value at 1 h and 1 d of 1.60E-08 and 1.09E-08 versus 6.10E-09 and 1.55E-09 in the Balb-c mice. C-jun, in contrast, was elevated during late regeneration in the NFAT4 KO mice (3.40E-09 and 5.67E-09 at 7 and 10 d, respectively) in comparison with the Balb-c mice (7.76E-10 and 1.24E-09, respectively.). NFAT2 was also up-regulated in the NFAT4 KO mice; however, no changes were detected in its downstream effectors, CCR1 and CCL3.",
        "Many studies have shown that preconditioning with anesthetics can be used to simulate the myocardial protective effects of ischemic preconditioning. But it is still not certain whether they can protect the myocardium in hemorrhagic shock. This study was designed to examine the myocardial protective effects of propofol and fentanyl in acute hemorrhagic shock.\n\nThirty-six white rabbits were randomly divided into a control group (group C), propofol preconditioning group (group P), and fentanyl preconditioning group (group F). The animal model of acute hemorrhagic shock was established according to Wigger\"s method. The same volumes of saline, propofol (5 mg/kg), or fentanyl (25 microg/kg) were administered 15 min before bleeding. Left ventricular function parameters were monitored continuously during 90 min of hemorrhagic shock. Serum cardiac troponin I (cTn-I) was detected by chemiluminescence before bleeding and 60 and 90 min after bleeding. Myocardial samples were taken for morphological studies.\n\nCompared with group C, the hemodynamic indexes in group F and group P were higher at each time point of shock (P < 0.05). The cTn-I values in group P and group F were lower than in group C (P < 0.05). Electron microscopic examination of the myocardium indicated that the alterations of myocardial structure and mitochondria were less pronounced in both group F and group P.",
        "We have observed that Western blot analysis with an anti-G1 antibody detects G1-NITEGE product in a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin motifs-4 (ADAMTS4)-digested fetal and mature human and bovine aggrecan, but the neoepitope-specific anti-NITEGE antibody only detects this product in digests of mature aggrecan. Our objective was to determine whether enzymatic removal of O- and/or N-linked oligosaccharides from the fetal products would enable detection of the NITEGE neoepitope with anti-NITEGE antibody.\n\nAggrecan was purified from fetal and mature human and bovine cartilage and digested with: (1) ADAMTS4, (2) ADAMTS4, sialidase II, and N-glycanase, (3) ADAMTS4, sialidase II, and O-glycanase, or (4) ADAMTS4, sialidase II, and both N- and O-glycanases. Western blot analysis was performed using anti-G1 and anti-NITEGE antibodies.\n\nWhen fetal G1-NITEGE products were treated with a combination of ADAMTS4, sialidase II, O-glycanase and N-glycanase, the resultant products migrated faster on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and the NITEGE neoepitope was rendered detectable.",
        "We investigated whether anthropometric measurements or metabolic risk factors correlated more with vascular changes associated with obesity.\n\nOne hundred never smoking subjects (71 women, 29 men) without vascular events, with blood pressure (BP) <140/90 mm Hg, LDL cholesterol <4 mmol/l, glucose <6.2 mmol/l participated. Anthropometric measurements (body mass index (BMI), waist/hip ratio (WHR), waist circumference (WC) and Waist/height ratio WHTR) and metabolic risk factors (glucose, insulin, lipid and uric acid levels plus BP) were assessed. Subjects underwent vascular measurements (Carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) using duplex ultrasonography, vascular stiffness assessment (Augmentation Index) by applanation tonometry and brachial artery reactivity tests).\n\nRisk factors were in the \"normal distribution\". BMI, WHR, WC, WHTR correlated significantly with triglyceride, HDL, LDL, insulin, glucose, uric acid and systolic BP levels (P<0.001). IMT correlated with WHTR, BMI, WC, Glucose (P<0.001), Homoeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) and cholesterol levels (P<0.05). Only Age, WHTR or BMI were significant correlates of IMT in a multivariate analysis (P<0.01) including WHTR or BMI, with age, sex, systolic BP, HDLc and HOMA. Augmentation Index correlated with age (P<0.0001), WHTR and WC (P<0.0005) but with age only in a multivariate analysis. Brachial reactivity did not correlate with any anthropometric or metabolic parameters. Anthropometric cutoff points, (BMI > or =25, WC > or =102 cm men, > or =88 cm women, WHR > or =0.9 men, > or =0.8 women and WHTR > or =0.5 men and women) significantly differentiated normal from abnormal metabolic and vascular measurements. The WHTR ratio > or =0.5 was as reliable as the BMI cutoff > or =25 in determining metabolic and vascular abnormalities. BMI and WHTR were strongly associated with 89% agreement (P<0.0001).",
        "Since 1915, various researchers have tried to make a 3-dimensional (3D) model of the complete face, with the dentition in the anatomically correct position. This was a difficult and time-consuming process. With the introduction of 3D digital imaging of the face and dental casts, researchers have regained interest in this topic. The purpose of this technical report is to present a feasibility study of the integration of a digital dental cast into a 3D facial picture.\n\nFor the integration, 3 digital data sets were constructed: a digital dental cast, a digital 3D photograph of the patient with the teeth visible, and a digital 3D photograph of the patient with the teeth in occlusion. By using a special iterated closest point algorithm, these 3 data sets were matched to place them in the correct anatomical position.\n\nAfter matching the 3 data sets, we obtained a 3D digital model with the dental cast visible through the transparent picture of the patient\"s face. When the distance between the matched data sets was calculated, an average distance of 0.35 mm (SD, 0.32 mm) was shown. This means that matching the data sets is acceptable.",

It has been shown that, in vitro, phosphate transforms vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) into calcifying cells, evidenced by upregulated expression of runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), whereas PTH is protective against VC. In addition, Runx2 has been detected in calcified arteries of CKD patients. However, the in vivo effect of phosphate and PTH on Runx2 expression remains unknown.\n\nWistar rats were submitted to parathyroidectomy, 5/6 nephrectomy (Nx) and continuous infusion of 1-34 rat PTH (at physiological or supraphysiological rates) or were sham-operated. Diets varied only in phosphate content, which was low (0.2%) or high (1.2%). Biochemical, histological, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analyses were performed.\n\nNephrectomized animals receiving high-PTH infusion presented VC, regardless of the phosphate intake level. However, phosphate overload and normal PTH infusion induced phenotypic changes in VSMCs, as evidenced by upregulated aortic expression of Runx2. High-PTH infusion promoted histological changes in the expression of osteoprotegerin and type I collagen in calcified arteries.",
        "It has long been assumed that newly absorbed vitamin A and E enter the body only via enterocyte-produced chylomicrons. However, recent results in cell cultures have shown that a fraction of alpha-tocopherol is secreted with intestinal HDL.\n\nThe aims of this study were to identify this transporter and to assess whether it is significantly implicated in the in vivo intestinal absorption of the 2 main dietary forms of vitamin E (ie, alpha- and gamma-tocopherol) and in that of retinyl palmitate (vitamin A).\n\nHaving performed preliminary experiments in the Caco-2 cell model, we compared fasting and postprandial plasma concentrations of vitamins A and E in mice deficient in ATP-binding cassette A1 (ABCA1) transporter and in wild-type mice.\n\nA substantial efflux of alpha- and gamma-tocopherol, but not of retinyl esters, was induced by the presence of apolipoprotein A-I at the basolateral side of Caco-2 monolayers. The efflux of alpha- and gamma-tocopherol was also impaired by glyburide and 4,4\"-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2\"-disulfonic acid. The postprandial response of plasma gamma-tocopherol was 4-fold lower in ABCA1(-/-) mice (P = 0.025) than in wild-type mice, whereas no significant difference was observed for retinyl esters. Fasting plasma alpha-tocopherol, but not vitamin A, concentrations were lower in mice bearing the genetic deletion.",
        "Renal ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury has been a major source of concern during the past decades and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been successfully used to prevent this injury. There have been some controversial reports about the involvement of K(ATP) channels in the mechanism of action of ACE inhibitors. In this study, we examined the effect of K(ATP) channel blocker (Glibenclamide) on preventive effect of captopril on renal IR injury.\n\nMale sprauge-dawley rats were pretreated with glibenclamide (1, 5 and 25 mg/kg) and/or captopril (5 mg/kg). They were anesthetized using ketamine (50 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). The left flank was incised and the left renal artery was clamped for 30 minutes. After that, the kidney was reperfused for 2 hours and then the animal was killed. The Right and left kidneys were removed and evaluated for microscopic damage.\n\nCaptopril reduced renal IR injury while glibenclamide by itself caused no change. Glibenclamide did not change the preventive effect of captopril.",
        "A particular interest in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which takes place during embryonic development, provided potential mechanisms involved in the progression of many epithelial tumors, including bladder cancer (BC). The phospho-Akt signaling pathway is supposed to be involved in invasion and progression of human tumors, including BC. Moreover, it has been demonstrated in bladder cancer cell lines that N-cadherin or phospho-epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression are correlated to tumor progression. Our objectives were to evaluate the potential phospho-Akt pathway involvement in N-cadherin and/or phospho-EGFR positive BC cell lines and to evaluate the prognostic value of E- and N-cadherin expression in patients undergoing cystectomy for invasive BC.\n\nWe screened a panel of invasive and noninvasive BC cell lines for E- and N-cadherin, phospho-EGFR, and phospho-Akt expression using the Western blot technique (WB). The potential role of N-cadherin in invasion was assessed by Matrigel assays with and without the N-cadherin blocking monoclonal antibody GC-4. Then we used the Affymetrix microarray technique to evaluate the prognostic value of E- and N-cadherin expression in 30 patients undergoing a cystectomy for invasive BC.\n\nN-cadherin and phospho-EGFR expression are associated with Akt activation and with invasive behavior modulation. Even if Akt activation is sufficient in promoting invasion, its inactivation by LY294002 (PI-3 kinase inhibitor) is less efficient on invasion than inhibition of N-cadherin and phospho-EGFR by GC-4 (monoclonal antibody) and gefitinib (anti-tyrosine kinase), respectively. N-cadherin and phospho-EGFR inhibition decreased phospho-Akt activation but also caused restoration and reinforcing of E-cadherin expression, respectively, while phospho-Akt inhibition did not have any impact on E-cadherin expression. In a group of high-risk bladder tumors (T(1)G(3)), N- and E-cadherin expression could be considered as a prognostic marker. In a group of patients with invasive BC (pT(2)-T(4)) undergoing cystectomy, we showed a shorter overall survival when BC expressed N-cadherin (P = 0.0064) and when E-cadherin expression was down-regulated (P = 0.00165). The N (positive) /E (negative) profile has the worst prognosis (P = 0.00153).",
        "Patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis have a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and atherosclerosis. Arterial stiffness is a measure of endothelial dysfunction and an independent predictor of cardiovascular events.\n\nTo investigate whether chronic plaque psoriasis is associated with an increased arterial stiffness.\n\nA cross-sectional study on 39 adult patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis and 38 control patients with skin diseases other than psoriasis was conducted. Arterial stiffness was assessed by carotid-femoral and carotid-radial pulse wave velocity (PWVcf, PWVcr).\n\nPWVcf was significantly higher in patients with psoriasis than in controls (means +/- SD; 8.88 +/- 1.96 vs. 7.57 +/- 1.34 m/s; p = 0.001). Difference was still significant after adjustment for age, gender, smoking status, hypertension and body mass index (8.78 +/- 1.98 vs. 7.78 +/- 2.0 m/s; p = 0.03).

        "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used to treat anxiety and depressive disorders. These agents may cause upper gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms that lead to their discontinuation. We examined whether SSRIs modify physiologic GI motor activities in freely moving rats.\n\nThe SSRIs fenfluramine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and fluoxetine were administered to 24-hour food-deprived rats, and then GI motility was measured in conscious, freely moving rats using a strain gauge force transducer method. Plasma acyl ghrelin levels were determined by enzyme immunoassay.\n\nPlasma acyl ghrelin levels were analyzed in conjunction with fasted motor activities. Acyl ghrelin was increased in association with the occurrence of Phase III-like contractions of the migrating motor complex in the antrum and duodenum. SSRIs decreased acyl ghrelin and changed Phase III-like contractions to fed-like motor activities. Both effects were blocked by 5-HT2c, but not 5-HT1b, receptor antagonist. Neither melanocortin 4 nor the 3/4 receptor antagonists blocked this motor effect, although they restored the anorexia induced by SSRIs. The improving effect on GI motility by 5-HT2c receptor (5-HT2cR) antagonist disappeared after treatment with a growth-hormone secretagogue receptor antagonist, whereas ghrelin or ghrelin-releasing drug such as TJ-43 changed SSRI-induced fed-like motor activities to fasted activities.",

        "The incidence of obesity has risen dramatically over the last few decades. This epidemic may be affected by exposure to xenobiotic chemicals. Bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine disruptor, is detectable at nanomolar levels in human serum worldwide. Adiponectin is an adipocyte-specific hormone that increases insulin sensitivity and reduces tissue inflammation. Thus, any factor that suppresses adiponectin release could lead to insulin resistance and increased susceptibility to obesity-associated diseases.\n\nIn this study we aimed to compare a) the effects of low doses of BPA and estradiol (E(2)) on adiponectin secretion from human breast, subcutaneous, and visceral adipose explants and mature adipocytes, and b) expression of putative estrogen and estrogen-related receptors (ERRs) in these tissues.\n\nWe determined adiponectin levels in conditioned media from adipose explants or adipocytes by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay. We determined expression of estrogen receptors (ERs) alpha and beta, G-protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30), and ERRs alpha, beta, and gamma by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.\n\nBPA at 0.1 and 1 nM doses suppressed adiponectin release from all adipose depots examined. Despite substantial variability among patients, BPA was as effective, and often more effective, than equimolar concentrations of E(2). Adipose tissue expresses similar mRNA levels of ERalpha, ERbeta, and ERRgamma, and 20- to 30-fold lower levels of GPR30, ERRalpha, and ERRbeta.",

        "Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a circulating collectin that is part of the innate immune response. We explored the serum levels of MBL in persons with different forms of coccidioidomycosis.\n\nSerum MBL was measured by ELISA from samples obtained from healthy donors with immunity to Coccidioides, and those with various forms of active coccidioidomycosis. Blood cell specimens from a subgroup of subjects with active coccidioidomycosis were examined for single nucleotide polymorphisms of the MBL gene and promoter regions.\n\nThe control group comprised 29 healthy immune subjects. Patient groups with active coccidioidomycosis consisted of 20 patients with symptomatic primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis, 26 with non-meningeal disseminated coccidioidomycosis, and nine with coccidioidal meningitis. The group with active coccidioidomycosis was significantly older and more likely to be male than the control group (for both, P < 0.001). The mean +/- SEM level of serum MBL in the healthy controls was 169.4 +/- 28.6 ng/ml, significantly higher than the 79.2 +/- 10.9 ng/ml for all active groups (P < 0.001). Moreover, the active coccidioidomycosis group was significantly more likely to have serum MBL level <or=70 ng/ml compared to the control group (P = 0.001).

        "Posterior capsular opacification (PCO) is caused by the proliferation and migration of residual lens epithelium cells (LECs) after extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE). Rapamcin (RAPA) is known to be a potent immunosuppressive drug with anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of rapamycin sustained release from modified intraocular lens (IOLs) in the prevention of PCO in rabbits.\n\nThree types of IOLs were used, including the original IOL without modification, IOL with polylactide-glycoli acid (PLGA) coating (PLGA-IOL), and RAPA-loaded PLGA-IOL (RAPA-PLGA-IOL). Sixty New Zealand albino rabbits undergoing phacoemulsification in left eyes were randomly and equally divided into three groups. Group A was implanted with the original IOLs, group B was implanted with the PLGA-IOLs, and group C was implanted with the RAPA-PLGA-IOLs. All of the 60 treated left eyes were examined by a slit-lamp microscope. The concentrations of RAPA in the aqueous humor and blood were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), indicating an vivo release of drug from the polymer carrier. Anterior segment tissue was histologically examined, and wet posterior capsules were weighed. Six months after intervention the PCO was graded.\n\nThe mean concentrations of RAPA in the aqueous humor from group C at 2 h, 1 days, 3 days, and 7 days after operation were 12.81 +/- 1.27 microg/ml, 14.57 +/- 0.99 microg/ml, 6.39 +/- 0.95 microg/ml, and 1.10 +/- 0.32 microg /ml respectively. The concentrations of RAPA in blood were undetectable. During the early days after the operation, the reactions of the anterior chamber from groups A and B were more severe than from group C. Our findings showed that the initial appearance of PCO in group C was much later than in the other two groups. The wet posterior capsules were weighed to be 0.3735 +/- 0.0943 g (group A), 0.3754 +/- 0.1093 g (group B), and 0.0432 +/- 0.0089 g (group C).

A single truncating mutation (epsilon1293insG) in the acetylcholine receptor epsilon subunit gene (CHRNE) was most often identified in CMS families originating from North Africa and was possibly a founder mutation.\n\nTwenty-three families were studied with an early onset form of CMS and originating from Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, and Libya. Screening for the mutation epsilon1293insG was performed by direct sequencing. Haplotype analysis was done with 9 (CA)n repeat microsatellite markers and 6 SNPs flanking epsilon1293insG on chromosome 17p13-p12. Dating was calculated using the ESTIAGE method for rare genetic diseases.\n\nThe epsilon1293insG mutation was identified in 14 families (about 60% of the initial 23). The expression of the CMS in affected members of these families was relatively homogeneous, without fetal involvement or being life-threatening, with moderate hypotonia and oculobulbar involvement, mild and stable disease course, and good response to cholinesterase inhibitors.

        "Indirect methods to predict the presence of esophageal varices (EV) in patients with cirrhosis are not sensitive enough to be used as a surrogate for endoscopy. We tested the effectiveness of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by transient elastography and the presence of insulin resistance (IR), a marker associated with fibrosis progression, in the noninvasive prediction of portal hypertension. One hundred four consecutive patients with newly diagnosed Child A hepatitis C virus (HCV) cirrhosis underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy to search for EV. Clinical, anthropometric, biochemical, ultrasonographic, and metabolic features, including IR by the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA), and LSM by transient elastography, were recorded at the time of endoscopy. EVs were detected in 63 of 104 patients (60%). In 10 patients (16%), the EVs were medium-large (>or=F2). By multivariate analysis, the presence of EVs was independently associated with a low platelet count/spleen diameter ratio (OR, 0.998; 95% CI, 0.996-0.999) and a high HOMA-IR score (OR, 1.296; 95%CI, 1.018-1.649), not with LSM (OR, 1.009; 95%CI, 0.951-1.070). It is noteworthy that nine of ten patients with medium-large EVs had a platelet/spleen ratio of less than 792 or an HOMA-IR of greater than 3.5. The independent association between low platelet count/spleen diameter ratio (OR, 0.998; 95%CI, 0.996-1.000), high HOMA-IR score (OR, 1.373; 95%CI, 1.014-1.859) and presence of EV was confirmed in the subgroup of 77 nondiabetic subjects.",
        "Studies in patients and experimental animals provide compelling evidence of the involvement of the major thrombin receptor, proteinase-activated receptor-1 (PAR(1)), and the potent chemokine, chemokine (CC motif) ligand-2 (CCL2)/monocyte chemotactic protein-1, in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). PAR(1) knockout mice are protected from bleomycin-induced lung inflammation and fibrosis and this protection is associated with marked attenuation in CCL2 induction.\n\nThe aim of this study was to determine which cell types represent the major source of PAR(1)-inducible CCL2 in the fibrotic lung.\n\nUsing immunohistochemistry and dual immunofluorescence, we examined PAR(1) and CCL2 expression in the bleomycin model and human IPF lung. PAR(1) and CCL2 gene expression was also assessed in laser-captured alveolar septae from patients with IPF. The ability of PAR(1) to induce CCL2 production by lung epithelial cells was also examined in vitro.\n\nWe report for the first time that PAR(1) and CCL2 are coexpressed and co-up-regulated on the activated epithelium in fibrotic areas in IPF. Similar observations were found in bleomycin-induced lung injury. Furthermore, we show that thrombin is a potent inducer of CCL2 gene expression and protein release by cultured lung epithelial cells via a PAR(1)-dependent mechanism.",
        "Schistosomiasis is a chronic liver disease that is endemic in rural areas of Egypt. Some patients may acquire infection and develop minimal complications while others may develop severe complications and progress to portal hypertension and cirrhosis especially if co-infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). The reasons for this are poorly understood. Previous studies suggested an independent role for Th2-biased cytokine responses to schistosomal antigens in persistent hepatic fibrosis and development of complications. Studies in murine schistosomiasis demonstrated that the development of fibrosis requires the production of the profibrotic cytokines such as IL-4. On the other hand, previous studies have suggested that reactive oxygen species may play an important role in schistosomal granuloma formation and disease progression\n\nTo investigate the status of the profibrotic IL-4 cytokine, oxidative stress (as indicated by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances), the antioxidants enzymes catalase and red blood cells glutathione content in a cohort of Egyptian patients affected with schistosomal hepatic disease and or hepatitis C infection.\n\nThe current study included four groups: patients with isolated HCV infection (HCV), comprised of 22 patients aged (mean +/- SD) 51.3 +/- 4.7 years; patients with HCV and schistosomal hepatic fibrosis (SHF) (Co-infected patients), comprised of 22 patients aged 49.6 +/- 4.0 years, patients with pure chronic schistosomiasis comprised of 22 patients with chronic schistosomiasis aged 53.7 +/- 5.6 years and a control group, comprised of 22 control subjects aged 48.5 +/- 5.4 years. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), Catalase activity and red blood cells glutathione contents were determined using chemical methods while plasma IL-4 was determined using a commercially available ELISA kit.\n\nA significant reduction in erythrocyte catalase activity in patients with isolated HCV infection, isolated SHF and those co-infected with SHF and HCV compared with the control group was found (P < 0.05). A similar pattern was found regarding erythrocyte glutathione content. Conversely TBARS level were significantly increased in patients with HCV, SHF and mixed groups compared with the control group (P < 0.05). Plasma IL-4-values were significantly increased in the three groups compared to the control subjects group. Furthermore, plasma IL-4 was significantly higher in patients with isolated SHF and those with SHF + HCV compared to the HCV alone patient group. Plasma IL-4 also correlated positively with portal vein diameter in SHF and SHF . HCV groups. (r = 0.54 and P < 0.05). Furthermore when all patients were analysed collectively, there was a positive correlation between plasma IL-4 and right lobe of the liver and plasma TBARS concentration.",
        "Mosquitoes are associated with the transmission of malaria, dengue, Japanese encephalitis, filariasis and other viral diseases throughout the globe, apart from being a nuisance pest. Biological control alone or as a part of integrated vector management stands to be a better alternative to the chemical controls aimed against pest mosquitoes. At the same time it is necessary to control bacteria by synthetic or natural means (plant products). Hence the present study was designed to screen the effect of mosquito larvicidal and antimicrobial activitiy of protein isolated from matured leaves of Solanum villosum against mosquito immatures and some pathogenic bacteria.\n\nAqueous solvent extract of fresh mature leaves of S. villosum was tested against 3rd instar larvae of Anopheles stephensi, Culex quinquefasciatus and Stegomyia aegypti mosquitoes and against four pathogenic bacteria. The protein fraction was isolated and tested for mosquitocidal and antibacterial activities. Amino acid analysis was performed on isolated protein using PICO.TAG amino acid system. SDS-PAGE was also done to detect the bands of amino acid on the basis of their molecular weights.\n\nProteins isolated from mature leaves of S. villosum were found to have larvicidal and antimicrobial properties. Analysis of the isolated protein identified fifteen amino acids of which eight were essential amino acids. SDS-PAGE detected seven bands corresponding to different molecular weights in the range of 69-109 KDa.",
        "Laboratory and epidemiologic studies have suggested a modifying effect of cardiac glycosides (for example, digoxin and digitoxin) on cancer risk. We explored the association between digoxin treatment and invasive breast cancer incidence among postmenopausal Danish women.\n\nWe used Danish registries to identify 5,565 postmenopausal women diagnosed with incident invasive breast carcinoma between 1 January 1991 and 31 December 2007, and 55,650 matched population controls. Cardiac glycoside prescriptions were ascertained from county prescription registries. All subjects had at least 2 years of recorded prescription drug and medical history data. We estimated the odds ratio associating digoxin use with breast cancer in conditional logistic regression models adjusted for age, county of residence, and use of anticoagulants, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), aspirin, and hormone replacement therapy. We also explored the impact of confounding by indication and detection bias.\n\nDigoxin was the sole cardiac glycoside prescribed to subjects during the study period. There were 324 breast cancer cases (5.8%) and 2,546 controls (4.6%) with a history of digoxin use at least 1 year before their index date (adjusted odds ratio (OR): 1.30; 95% confidence interval: 1.14 to 1.48). The breast cancer OR increased modestly with increasing duration of digoxin exposure (adjusted OR for 7 to 18 years of digoxin use: 1.39; 95% confidence interval: 1.10 to 1.74). The association was robust to adjustment for age, receipt of hormone replacement therapy, coprescribed drugs, and confounding by indication. A comparison of screening mammography rates between cases and controls showed no evidence of detection bias.",
        "Prospective studies have shown that C-reactive protein (CRP) is a predictor of hypertension. Because of confounding variables, a causal linkage between CRP and hypertension has not been clearly shown. We investigated whether high circulating concentrations of human CRP can induce hypertension in rats.\n\nWe administered a single intravenous injection of adeno-associated virus-green fluorescent protein (AAV-GFP) or AAV-hCRP and measured blood pressure. Using ELISA, we measured serum hCRP, serum endothelin 1 (ET-1), and urine cGMP, and we measured serum nitric oxide (NO) using the Griess method. We recorded heart rate, maximum pressure, arterial elastance, mean aortic pressure, cardiac output, and maximum rate of rise in left ventricular pressure (dP/dt max).\n\nA single injection of AAV-hCRP resulted in efficient and sustained hCRP expression and led to increased blood pressure 2 months after gene transfer that persisted for another 2 months. This effect was associated with decreased NO production, as demonstrated by decreased serum NO concentration and urinary cGMP excretion, and impairment of endothelial-dependent vascular relaxation. CRP transduction also increased expression of angiotensin type 1 receptor, ET-1, and endothelin type A receptor, decreased expression of angiotensin type 2 receptor and endothelial NO synthase in thoracic aortas, and increased arterial stiffness. Ex vivo studies indicated a similar detrimental effect of CRP that was reversed by the NO donor.",
        "Monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) is a chemokine ligand that has been associated with aggressive behavior in breast and prostate cancer. The present study was performed to determine if there is a relationship between the expression of MCP-1 in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and factors indicative of aggressive behavior in this disease.\n\nThe subjects of this study were 115 patients with PTC. MCP-1 expression was determined using a semiquantitative scoring system for immunohistochemical staining of MCP-1 in resected PTC samples. There were four levels of immunohistochemical staining intensity, and the population of cells that positively stained for MCP-1 was graded at four levels. The scores for the intensity of immunohistochemical staining for MCP-1 and for the percentage of cells that stained for MCP-1 were used to generate a range from 0 to 9 for scoring MCP-1 expression.\n\nPositive staining for MCP-1 was observed in the cytoplasm of PTC cells and stroma cells in 79.2% of the specimens. Expression levels of MCP-1 in PTC cells were positively correlated with tumor size (p < 0.05) and lymph node involvement (p < 0.05). In addition, the expression of MCP-1 in PTC cells level was an independent predictive factor for recurrence of PTC in an analysis that included age, sex, tumor size, extrathyroidal infiltration, and lymph node involvement (p < 0.005).",
        "Evidence from animal models suggests that fetal undernutrition can predispose to hypercholesterolemia and metabolic disorders directly by programming cholesterol metabolism and may indirectly influence lifestyle choices. We have shown that persons who were exposed to the Dutch famine in early gestation have a more atherogenic lipid profile.\n\nWe now investigate whether the excess in hypercholesterolemia may be a result of a more atherogenic diet or a reduction in physical activity.\n\nWe measured lipid profiles, dietary intake, and physical activity in 730 men and women (aged 58 y) born in the Wilhelmina Gasthuis in Amsterdam, Netherlands, around the time of the Dutch famine, whose birth records have been kept.\n\nNo differences were observed in mean intake of total energy or percentage of protein, carbohydrate, and fat in the diet between the different exposure groups. However, persons exposed to famine in early gestation were twice as likely (odds ratio: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.2, 3.9) to consume a high-fat diet (defined as the highest quartile of percentage of fat in the diet: >39% of energy from fat). They also tended to be less physically active (45% did sports compared with 52% in the unexposed group), although this did not reach statistical significance.",
        "Hepcidin is a key regulator of iron homeostasis, but to date no studies have examined the effect of hepcidin on iron absorption in humans.\n\nOur objective was to assess relations between both serum hepcidin and serum prohepcidin with nonheme-iron absorption in the presence and absence of food with the use of dual stable-iron-isotope techniques.\n\nThe study group included 18 healthy nonpregnant women. Women received in random order a supplemental iron source (7.6 mg FeSO4 providing 0.9 mg 58Fe as FeSO4) and 6.8 mg 57Fe ferrous sulfate tracer administered with a nonheme food source [orange-fleshed sweet potato (OFSP): 1.4 mg native Fe]. Iron absorption was determined by analyzing blood samples taken 14 d after dosing with the use of magnetic sector thermal ionization mass spectrometry. Serum hepcidin was assessed by a new competitive serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) specific for the refolded, mature 25-amino acid form, and serum prohepcidin was assessed by an ELISA specific for amino acids 28-47 of the hepcidin prohormone.\n\nIn these women, iron absorption averaged 14.71 +/- 10.7% from the supplemental iron compared with 3.63 +/- 6.5% from the OFSP. Absorption of nonheme iron assessed in the presence (P = 0.038) and absence (P = 0.0296) of food was significantly associated with serum hepcidin but was not significantly related to serum prohepcidin.",
        "Prognosis of patients following resection of CRC metastases to the liver has traditionally been predicted by clinical risk factors. In the era of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, determination of new prognostic indicators of outcome are necessary.\n\nThis retrospective study includes patients with CRC liver metastases, who received oxaliplatin or irinotecan based neoadjuvant chemotherapy and underwent R0 resection. Patients were followed by CT and PET-CT, before, during and after chemotherapy and surgery. The predictive value of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Clinical Score (MSKCC-CS) and degree of response to chemotherapy (measured by CT and PET-CT), were analyzed by univariate and multivariate COX regression.\n\nIncluded are 54 patients. Overall 1-, 2-, 3-year survival rates 88%, 70%, and 39%. Response to chemotherapy on CT was a significant predictor of survival on univariate (P = 0.03) and multivariate analysis (P = 0.03), whereas MSKCC-CS and response to chemotherapy on PET-CT were not. Multivariate analysis demonstrated response to chemotherapy as a predictor of time to recurrence on CT (P = 0.02) and PET-CT (P = 0.03), while the MSKCC-CS (P = 0.64) was not.",
        "Behavioral studies have shown that infants can form associations between environmental events and produce anticipatory actions for the predictable event, but the neural mechanisms for the learning and anticipation of events in infants are not known. Recent neuroimaging studies revealed that the association cortices of infants show activation related to auditory-stimulus discrimination and novelty detection during sleep. In the present study, we expected that when an auditory cue (beeps) predicted an auditory event (a female voice), specific regions of the infant cortex would show anticipatory activation before the event onset even while sleeping.\n\nWe examined the cortical activation of 3-month-old infants during delays between the cue and the event by using multi-channel near-infrared spectroscopy. To investigate spatiotemporal changes in cortical activation over the experimental session, we divided the session into two phases (early and late phase) and analyzed each phase separately. In the early phase, the frontal regions showed activation in response to the cue that was followed by the event compared with another cue that was not followed by any event. In the late phase, the temporoparietal region, in addition to the frontal region, showed prominent activation in response to the cue followed by the event. In contrast, when the cue was followed by an event and no-event in equal proportions, cortical activation in response to the cue was not observed in any phase.",
        "Endothelial function as determined by flow-mediated dilation (FMD) deteriorates during postprandial lipemia. The impairment can be neutralized by adding 50 g casein to the fatty meal. The objective of this study was to see which of the casein constituents is responsible for this neutralization effect.\n\nA crossover design was used in 15 healthy volunteers, who were given 3 ml cream/kg body weight with and without 2.5 g L-arginine. Lipids and FMD were then determined hourly over a period of 6h. In substudies this design was repeated with 2.5 g phenylalanine and 5 g leucine in 11 subjects. The effect of 2.5 g L-arginine on FMD in the absence of cream was tested in seven subjects.\n\nWithout L-arginine the FMD deteriorated during 4h after the fat loading. Addition of L-arginine prevented this deterioration at 3 and 4h. Phenylalanine and leucine, in contrast, did not prevent the lipemic endothelial dysfunction. L-Arginine alone similarly had no acute effect on the FMD.",
        "p-values are ubiquitous in medical research, but are often misunderstood. In addition to being misused or perhaps even abused at post-statistical analysis stage of making scientific inference and interpretations, p-values can also be a source of confusion at the design stage.\n\nApplication of standard test statistic on observed data may result in a small p-value which in turn may give the impression that a new study that has the same sample size as the observed data, perhaps even smaller, would have adequate power. We used re-sampling method and computed statistical power to illustrate the fallacy of this conclusion. We have also calculated power using analytical formulae.\n\nWe analyzed data consisting of two group comparisons with binary as well as continuous outcome variables. For the binary outcome, the event rates for the outcome of interest in the illustrative data were 15/43 (35%) and 22/34 (65%), respectively (p-value=0.0093). Using these data, a bootstrap-based empirical power was estimated to be 75.4%. One random sample with only two-third of the original data had a p-value of 0.0066, but only an empirical power of 57.4%. Similar results were observed for a continuous outcome.",
        "To understand the mechanisms underlying chronic interpersonal difficulties and their detrimental influence on mental and physical health.\n\nA total of 103 healthy young women (mean age = 17 years) were administered a structured interview to assess the degree of chronic interpersonal stress in their lives. At the same time, blood was drawn to measure systemic inflammation, the expression of signaling molecules that regulate immune activation, and leukocyte production of the cytokine interleukin-6 after ex vivo stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. All of the immunologic assessments were repeated 6 months later.\n\nTo the extent subjects were high in chronic interpersonal stress at baseline, their leukocytes displayed greater increases in messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) for the proinflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) over the next 6 months. They also showed larger increases in mRNA for inhibitor of kappaB, a molecule that sequesters NF-kappaB in the cytoplasm and minimizes its proinflammatory activities. Chronic interpersonal stress at baseline was unrelated to changes in biomarkers of systemic inflammation but was associated with increasingly pronounced interleukin-6 responses to lipopolysaccharide. These associations were independent of demographics, lifestyle variables, and depressive symptoms.",
        "The aim of this study is to compare self-reported health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) with the objective of exercise performance in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) according to diagnosis.\n\n564 patients (255 females, 14-73 years) with various CHD (62 shunt, 66 left heart obstruction, 33 PS/PR, 47 Ebstein, 96 Fallot, 98 TGA after atrial switch, 38 other TGA, 31 Fontan, 32 palliated/native cyanotic, 61 others) and a group of 53 healthy controls (18 females, 14-57 years) completed a QoL questionnaire (SF-36) and performed a symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise test. Despite several limitations at exercise (P = 1.30 x 10(-33)), patients only reported reductions in HRQoL concerning physical functioning (P = 4.41 x 10(-15)) and general health (P = 6.17 x 10(-5)) and not psychosocial aspects. This could be confirmed in all diagnostic subgroups. Correlation to peak oxygen uptake was found in physical functioning (r = 0.435, P = 1.72 x 10(-27)) and general health (r = 0.275, P = 3.79 x 10(-11)).

        "This phase III study tested the hypothesis that the CA-125-specific murine monoclonal antibody, oregovomab, administered as a monoimmunotherapy after front-line therapy in a selected ovarian cancer population would prolong time to relapse (TTR) and, ultimately, survival.\n\nPatients with stage III to IV ovarian cancer with preoperatively elevated CA-125 and objectively defined characteristics were randomly assigned 4 to 12 weeks after front-line carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy to maintenance monoimmunotherapy in a fully blinded protocol. Two mg of oregovomab or placebo was infused over 20 minutes at weeks 0, 4, and 8 and then 12 weeks until recurrence or up to year 5. Patients were evaluated with serial imaging and clinical evaluation for evidence of recurrence at quarterly visits. TTR was the primary end point.\n\nThree hundred seventy-three patients were accrued at more than 60 centers; 251 patients were assigned to oregovomab and 120 patients were assigned to placebo. The treatment arms were well balanced. There were no differences in the clinical outcomes between treatment groups. Median TTR measured from randomization after completion of chemotherapy for the integrated study was 10.3 months (95% CI, 9.7 to 13.0 months) for oregovomab and 12.9 months (95% CI, 10.1 to 17.4 months) for placebo (P = .29, log-rank test).

        "Personality and psychiatric disorders are reported to be more common in dyspeptic patients with severe complaints, but it remains unclear whether this association exists for patients with mild and moderate dyspepsia.\n\nTo study the association between dyspeptic symptom severity and psychopathology, major life events and coping ability in patients with a new episode of dyspepsia. METHODS; Dyspeptic symptom severity was measured using the validated eight symptom Veldhuyzen van Zanten questionnaire. Psychopathology was measured using the Symptom Check List-90 (SCL 90). Major life events were measured with a modified version of the Social Readjustment Rating Scale (SRRS). Coping styles were measured by a short version of the Utrecht Coping Questionnaire, distinguishing six coping styles. Linear regression was used to assess the relationship between dyspepsia symptom severity and psychological factors.\n\nIn all, 664 patients with a new episode of uninvestigated dyspepsia, aged >18 years were included. Dyspeptic symptom severity was positively correlated with the presence of depression (P < 0.01), somatization symptoms (P < 0.01), use of an active coping style (P < 0.01) and negatively correlated with age (P < 0.01).",
        "Previously, we hypothesized that exposing the distal oesophagus to acid signals the stomach to decrease gastric acidity.\n\nTo test the hypothesis that exposing the distal oesophagus to acid signals the stomach to decrease gastric acidity.\n\nTwenty-two healthy humans ingested a standard meal containing [(14)C]octanoic acid and [(13)C]glycine over 30 min on 2 separate occasions. Gastric pH was measured for 90 min before and 240 min after the meal. 10 mm HCl was infused continuously at 1 mL/min into either the distal oesophagus or stomach in a 2-way crossover fashion for 60 min before and 240 min after the meal. Gastric emptying of solid and liquid were determined with breath tests.\n\nCompared to gastric infusion, oesophageal infusion significantly decreased gastric acidity after the meal, but not before the meal and the magnitude of the decrease varied directly with gastric acidity. Gastric emptying of solid or liquid with oesophageal infusion was not significantly different from that with gastric infusion.",
        "Alzheimer\"s disease is the most common cause of dementia occurring in the elderly. The identification of the genetic factors in the familial forms of the disease enabled the generation of transgenic animals which reproduce an essential part of its pathology. Various lines of transgenic mice expressing human wild-type or mutated APP have been reported. The phenotype expressed in these mice varies according to the transgene itself, the promoter used for its expression, and the level of expression achieved in the brain, but is also determined by the genetic background of the mice.\n\nWe analyzed the variability in the amyloid load by ELISA and the levels of huAPP transcripts by quantitative PCR in our PS2APP double-transgenic mice when expressed in a mixed C57Bl/6, DBA/2 background.\n\nIn 12-month-old PS2APP double-transgenic mice, the amount of cerebral amyloid deposits is directly correlated with the levels of the huAPP transgenic transcript. Furthermore, a reduction in human APP transcripts by 50% leads to a complete absence of cerebral deposits at the age of 12 months.",

In the era of destination therapy and the total artificial heart, predicting post-LVAD RV failure requiring mechanical support is extremely important.\n\nWe reviewed patient characteristics, laboratory values and hemodynamic data from 266 patients who underwent LVAD placement at the University of Pennsylvania from April 1995 to June 2007.\n\nOf 266 LVAD recipients, 99 required RV assist device (BiVAD) placement (37%). We compared 36 parameters between LVAD (n = 167) and BiVAD patients (n = 99) to determine pre-operative risk factors for RV assist device (RVAD) need. By univariate analysis, 23 variables showed statistically significant differences between the two groups (p < or = 0.05). By multivariate logistic regression, cardiac index < or =2.2 liters/min/m(2) (odds ratio [OR] 5.7), RV stroke work index < or =0.25 mm Hg . liter/m(2) (OR 5.1), severe pre-operative RV dysfunction (OR 5.0), pre-operative creatinine > or =1.9 mg/dl (OR 4.8), previous cardiac surgery (OR 4.5) and systolic blood pressure < or =96 mm Hg (OR 2.9) were the best predictors of RVAD need.",
        "Expression of the principal initiator of coagulation, tissue factor (TF), by colorectal cancer (CRC) cells is involved in tumoral angiogenesis and metastasis progression, after binding of factor VIIa (FVIIa) to TF and generation of TF-FVIIa activity. We thus hypothesized that inhibition of the TF pathway by active site-blocked FVIIa (FFR-FVIIa) may prevent the development of hepatic metastasis in CRC.\n\nRat tumoral cells (DHDK12 proB cells) expressing high levels of TF were injected in the portal vein in syngenic BDIX rats. Rats received intraperitoneal injection of either FFR-FVIIa, from d 3 to d 7 (adjuvant treatment) (n = 19), or solvent buffer (n = 18) (control group). Additionally, cancer cells were infused subcutaneously in 20 other rats, which were assigned to FFR-FVIIa adjuvant treatment (n = 10), or buffer treatment (n = 10). Macroscopic and histological analysis was performed at d 14.\n\nIn the control group, infusion of cancer cells resulted in development of macroscopic hepatic tumors in 17/18 rats. In the adjuvant FFR-FVIIa group, macroscopic hepatic tumors were visible on the liver surface in 3/19 rats (P = 0.002 versus control). All rats with subcutaneous injection of proB cells exhibited macroscopic tumors, with no significant difference between the control and the treated ones.",
        "Obesity is epidemic in the 21st century and has been shown to be a risk factor for developing severe acute pancreatitis. Adipose tissue produces small molecules called adipokines, which are important in modulating metabolism and inflammation. The anti-inflammatory adipokine adiponectin is decreased in obesity and inversely mirrors the severity of pancreatitis in a murine experimental model. Adiponectin acts through two receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2; no data are currently available regarding adiponection receptor expression in the obese murine pancreas.\n\nImmunohistochemical and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis were undertaken to determine expression of adiponectin receptors AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 in the pancreas and liver of lean (C57BL/6J) and congenitally obese (Lep(Ob) and Lep(Db)) mice.\n\nImmunohistochemistry confirmed expression of both AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 in the pancreas of all three murine strains. Staining was positive in acinar cells and to a lesser extent in islet cells. Pancreatic gene expression of AdipoR2 was similar among lean and obese mice. AdipoR1 gene expression, however, was significantly (P < 0.001) decreased in the pancreas of both Lep(Ob) and Lep(Db) mice compared to wild-type lean animals. Gene expression of both AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 was significantly less in the liver of obese (Lep(Ob) and Lep(Db)) mice compared to wild-type lean animals (P < 0.001).",
        "An enriched environmental exposure has been shown to promote hippocampal neurogenesis, which is an important mechanism underlying enrichment-induced memory improvement. The cAMP response element-binding protein is an important stimulus-inducible factor in the brain and is crucial for neurogenesis and memory ability. Calmodulin activation is important for activity-induced cAMP response element-binding protein phosphorylation. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of calmodulin activation on hippocampal neurogenesis and spatial memory improvement in rats exposed to enriched environment.\n\nNinety-six neonatal pups were assigned to four groups: control group, enriched environment group, control + trifluoperazine (trifluoperazine, 5 mg/kg) group and enriched environment + trifluoperazine group. Pups in the enriched environment and enriched environment + trifluoperazine groups were exposed to enriched environments for 25 min from P10 to P24. Half of pups in each group were intraperitoneally injected with 50 mg/kg BrdU every other day from P10 to P24. Pups without BrdU injection were euthanized at P24, and hippocampal nuclear Ca(2+)-calmodulin and phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein were detected. Morris water maze acquisition and subsequent probe trial retention were performed in remained rats after P50 and immunohistochemistry was used to identify proliferating cells in the dentate gyrus 1 day after the probe trial.\n\nThe trifluoperazine injection could completely inhibit the environmental enrichment-induced activations of calmodulin and cAMP response element-binding protein. Enriched environmental exposure could improve Morris water maze performance and increase hippocampal BrdU-labeled cells, but the effects could be completely blocked by trifluoperazine injection.",
        "The discovery of IL-7R(alpha) polymorphisms implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis has highlighted the importance of interleukin 7 (IL-7) in central nervous system diseases. Hypoxia affects neurological disease states in part by modulating expression of many early and late response genes. The present work used cultured PC12 cells to investigate the effect of hypoxia on IL-7 expression.\n\nPC12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco\"s modified Eagle\"s medium (DMEM)/F12 medium. RNA was isolated and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was run to quantify messenger RNA (mRNA) change. Western blots were used to assess IL-7 protein change in the medium. Extracellular free Ca(2+) was removed by using Ca(2+)-free DMEM/F12 with 1 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid for 45 minutes before the start of hypoxia.\n\nExposure of PC12 cells to 1% oxygen for 6 hours decreased IL-7 mRNA by 77% using RT-PCR (p<0.01). Exposure to 1% oxygen for 24 hours decreased IL-7 protein in the medium by 21% (p<0.05). As hypoxia duration increased (2, 4, 6 and 24 hours) or oxygen concentrations decreased (10%, 5% and 1%), IL-7 mRNA expression progressively decreased. Removal of extracellular free Ca(2+) completely prevented these hypoxia-induced decreases of IL-7 mRNA.",
        "The 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) is a widely used measurement of functional exercise capacity in chronic lung disease. While exercise intolerance has been identified in patients with bronchiectasis, the clinical determinants of the 6MWT in this population have not been examined. The aim of this study was to 1) establish the relationship between the 6-Minute Walk Distance (6MWD), disease severity and Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) and 2) identify predictors of exercise tolerance in adults with bronchiectasis.\n\nThe 6MWT was performed in 27 patients with bronchiectasis (mean [SD] FEV(1) 73.9% predicted [23.4]). Disease severity was assessed using spirometry and HRCT scoring while HRQOL was evaluated using the St George\"s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the Short-Form 36 (SF-36). The relationships were evaluated using correlation and multiple regression.\n\nThe 6MWD correlated positively with FVC (r=0.52, p<0.01), generations of bronchopulmonary divisions (r(s)=0.38, p<0.05) and SF-36 physical summary (r=0.71, p<0.001) while a negative correlation was observed between all domains of the SGRQ (all correlations r>0.5, p<0.001). Multiple regression analysis indicated that the SGRQ activity, symptom scores and generations of bronchial divisions involved were identified as independent predictors of the 6MWD, explaining 76% of the variance.",
        "Factor (F) VIII consists of a heavy chain (A1A2B domains) and light chain (A3C1C2 domains), while the contiguous A1A2 domains are separate subunits in the cofactor, FVIIIa. Recently we reported that procofactor stability at elevated temperature and cofactor stability over an extended time course were increased following replacement of individual charged residues (Asp(D)519, Glu(E)665 or Glu(E)1984) with either Ala (A) or Val (V) (Wakabayashi et al., Blood, 112, 2761, 2008).\n\nIn the current study we generated combination mutants at these three sites to examine any additive and/or synergistic effects of these mutations on stability.\n\nStudies assessing FVIII stability involved monitoring decay rates of FVIII at 55 degrees C or in guanidinium, decay of FVIIIa following A2 subunit dissociation, and thrombin generation at low (0.3 nmol L(-1)) FVIII concentration.",
        "Rho guanidine triphosphatases (GTPases) are major regulators of cell migration. We investigated the cytoskeleton and Rho GTPases during cell migration and morphogenesis processes in isolated rat liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) cultured on Matrigel while stimulated by the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).\n\nTo obtain primary monolayers, LSECs were cultured on Matrigel for 5-17 h with or without VEGF. Sinusoidal endothelial fenestrae (SEF) morphology was observed using scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. RhoA, Rac1 and phosphorylated myosin light-chain kinase, Rho-binding domain of Rhotekin and the p21-binding domain of p21-activated protein kinase were analysed using Western blotting.\n\nThe LSECs showed cellular protrusions and or cords of aligned cells resembling primitive capillary-like structures, with SEF contraction. Time course analyses of Rac1 activation matched specific morphological changes. Rac1 activity increased progressively to 17 h in cells cultured without VEGF, but markedly increased at 7 h in the presence of VEGF. RhoA activity was slightly elevated at 5 h. The levels of endogenous caveolin-1 (CAV-1) expression increased in a time-dependent manner, reaching a peak at 7 h. CAV-1 expression occurred immediately before the formation of the capillary-like tube. Moreover, treatment with VEGF regulated CAV-1 expression in LSECs.",
        "In the present study we evaluated the effect of exercise on the plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and the anti-inflammatory molecule uric acid in the Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats that are more prone to develop type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\nSixteen obese ZDF (Gmi fa/fa) rats (8 wk old, 228.40 +/- 4.05 g) were randomly assigned to one of two groups (n = 8 each): an exercise-trained group and a sedentary one. In addition, 16 lean ZDF (Gmi +/+) rats (8 wk old, 199.00 +/- 3.50 g) were subjected to identical sedentary and exercise conditioning (n = 8 each). Initially, rats swam 15 min/d (5 d/wk) in a 36 degrees C bath. The exercise protocol was gradually increased by 15 min/d until a swimming period of 1 h/d (1 wk) was attained. Thereafter, rats swam 1 h/d, 3 d/wk, for an additional period of 11 wk. Rats were sacrificed 48 h after the last training period and the blood and pancreas were collected. Circulating levels of glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, total cholesterol, triglycerides, insulin, uric acid, IL-6, and TNF-alpha were assessed. The concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines in the pancreas were also evaluated.\n\nIn the diabetic ZDF (fa/fa) rats, exercise decreased hyperuricemia (-37.3%) and IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels (-16.9% and -12.7% respectively) and maintained the weight of the pancreas at near normal. Immunohistochemistry revealed a marked decrease in the expression of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in the pancreatic islet cells of ZDF (fa/fa) rats.",
        "We have made use of publicly available gene expression data to identify transcription factors and transcriptional modules (regulons) associated with leaf development in Populus. Different tissue types were compared to identify genes informative in the discrimination of leaf and non-leaf tissues. Transcriptional modules within this set of genes were identified in a much wider set of microarray data collected from leaves in a number of developmental, biotic, abiotic and transgenic experiments.\n\nTranscription factors that were over represented in leaf EST libraries and that were useful for discriminating leaves from other tissues were identified, revealing that the C2C2-YABBY, CCAAT-HAP3 and 5, MYB, and ZF-HD families are particularly important in leaves. The expression of transcriptional modules and transcription factors was examined across a number of experiments to select those that were particularly active during the early stages of leaf development. Two transcription factors were found to collocate to previously published Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) for leaf length. We also found that miRNA family 396 may be important in the control of leaf development, with three members of the family collocating with clusters of leaf development QTL.",
        "The classification of neuroendocrine lung tumors has changed over the last decades. Reliable diagnoses are crucial for the quality of clinical databases. The purpose of this study is to determine to which extent the use of different diagnostic criteria of neuroendocrine lung tumors has influenced the classification of these tumors. The prognostic information of tumor, node, metastasis descriptors was also evaluated.\n\nWe retrieved 110 tumors from the period 1989 to 2007. All tumors were reclassified according to the World Health Organization classification of 2004. Tumor, node, metastasis descriptors were evaluated.\n\nBy reclassification, the diagnoses on 48 tumors (44%) were changed. More diagnoses were changed in the older part of the material. A significantly different survival was shown for all patients in relation to tumor size (p < 0.0001). An endobronchial component was seen in 54%, 31%, and 11% of typical carcinoid, atypical carcinoid, and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, respectively with no impact on survival (p = 0.90). For all included patients the survival was significantly worse for patients having metastasis to N1 nodes as compared with N0 (p = 0.03). However, the number of removed lymph nodes were insufficient for definitive determination of the prognostic impact of node metastases. Regarding the revised diagnoses, a significant difference in survival between typical carcinoid, atypical carcinoid, large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma and small cell carcinoma was noted (p < 0.005).",
        "Until recently, there has been no unified definition of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) in the youth. Therefore, the prevalence of MetS and its association with potential correlates are largely unknown.\n\nThe objective was to quantify the prevalence, identify the correlates, and examine the independent associations between potential correlates with MetS.\n\nA population-based cohort study was conducted in 10- and 15-y-old youth from Estonia, Denmark, and Portugal (n = 3193). MetS was defined according to the International Diabetes Federation. Correlates included maternal socioeconomic status, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, and prevalent diabetes and maternally reported child\"s birth weight and duration of breastfeeding. Data on sexual maturity, objectively measured physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness, self-reported sports participation, television viewing, and regular play were collected for the children.\n\nThe prevalence of MetS was 0.2% and 1.4% in 10- and 15-y-olds, respectively. Cardiorespiratory fitness (standardized odds ratio: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.15, 0.75), physical activity (standardized odds ratio: 0.40; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.88), and maternal BMI (standardized odds ratio: 1.61; 95% CI: 1.11, 2.34) were all independently associated with MetS after adjustment for sex, age group, study location, birth weight, and sexual maturity. An increase in daily moderate-intensity physical activity by 10-20% was associated with a 33% lower risk of being categorized with MetS.",
        "Iron supplements are commonly recommended for infants but were suggested to inhibit zinc and copper absorption.\n\nThe objective of this study was to investigate potential effects of iron supplementation, infant age, and mineral status on zinc and copper absorption in infants at 6 and 9 mo of age.\n\nTwenty-five healthy breastfed term infants were recruited from a larger randomized iron supplementation trial. Six of these infants received iron supplements (1 mg . kg(-1) . d(-1)) from 4 to 9 mo, 8 were supplemented from 6 to 9 mo, and 11 received placebo only. Zinc and copper absorption was measured at 6 and 9 mo of age, using orally administered (70)Zn and (65)Cu and fecal monitoring of recovered stable isotopes.\n\nMean (+/-SD) zinc absorption was 51.9 +/- 17.9%, and mean copper absorption was 79.0 +/- 13.5%. No significant difference was observed in zinc or copper absorption between 6 and 9 mo of age. When combining all measurements, no significant effect of prior iron supplementation was observed on zinc or copper absorption. No significant correlation was observed between plasma zinc and zinc absorption or between plasma copper and copper absorption. No significant correlation was observed between erythrocyte copper-zinc-dependent superoxide dismutase activity and copper absorption.",
        "Effects of air pollution exposure on IgE-mediated response in asthmatics are poorly investigated. The aim was to examine the relationship between air pollution concentrations and total IgE levels in adult asthmatics.\n\nThe present study relates to the 369 asthmatic adults from the French Epidemiological study on Genetics and Environment of Asthma (EGEA), with availability of data on both total serum IgE measurements and air pollution concentrations. Geo-statistical models were performed on 4 x 4 km grids to assess individual outdoor air pollution exposure. Annual outdoor concentrations of ozone (O(3)), nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), sulphur dioxide (SO(2)), and particulate matter smaller than 10 microm size (PM(10)), and concentrations of summer ozone were assigned to subject\"s home address.\n\nThe geometric mean of total IgE was 161 IU/ml and the average of O(3) exposure was 44.9 +/- 9.5 microg/m(3). Ozone concentrations were positively related to total IgE levels and an increase of 10 microg/m(3) of O(3) resulted in an increase of 20.4% (95% CI = 3.0-40.7) in total IgE levels. Adjustment for age, gender, smoking habits and previous life in the countryside did not change the results, and an increase of 19.1% (2.4-38.6) in total IgE was observed with O(3). Negative associations observed between NO(2) and total IgE levels disappeared after including O(3) in the models. Neither SO(2) nor PM(10) were correlated with total IgE levels.",
        "To study the relationship between the downregulated expression of secretory leukocyte proteinase inhibitor (SLPI) in human bronchial epithelial cells and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1/Smads pathway.\n\nNormal human bronchial epithelial cells of the line HBE were cultured and divided into 4 groups: TGF-beta1 stimulation group stimulated by TGF-beta1, interference group preincubated with Smad4 siRNA and then stimulated by TGF-beta1, interference control group preincubated with negative siRNA and then stimulated by TGF-beta1, and normal control group. Forty-eight hours later immunocytochemistry was used to observe the SLPI positive staining in the cells, and the protein and mRNA expression levels of Smad4 and SLPI were detected by Western blotting and RT-PCR respectively.\n\nImmunocytochemistry showed that the Smad4 staining was strongly positive in the TGF-beta1 stimulation group and interference control group, and the SLPI staining was strongly positive in the normal control group, positive in the interference group, and only weakly positive in the TGF-beta1 stimulation and interference control groups. The protein and mRNA expression levels of Smad4 in the HBE cells of the TGF-beta1 stimulation group were 1.18 +/- 0.17 and 1.33 +/- 0.16 respectively, both significantly higher than those of the normal control group (0.29 +/- 0.06 and 0.31 +/- 0.07 respectively, both P < 0.01) and interference group (0.27 +/- 0.08 and 0.34 +/- 0.09 respectively, both P < 0.01). The protein and mRNA expression levels of SLPI in the HBE cells of the TGF-beta1 stimulation group were 0.17 +/- 0.10 and 0.11 +/- 0.05 respectively, both significantly lower than those of the normal control group (1.29 +/- 0.21 and 0.83 +/- 0.13 respectively, both P < 0.01), and those of the interference group (1.22 +/- 0.18 and 0.81 +/- 0.11 respectively, both P < 0.01). There were no significant differences in the expression levels of Smad4 and SLPI between the TGF-beta1 stimulation group and interference control group.",
        "Posttraumatic systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis and their subsequent complication, the multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), remain major complications following polytrauma. This prospective clinical study aimed at evaluating the association between these and plasma interleukin-18 (IL-18) and neopterin levels.\n\nInclusion in the series required an Injury Severity Score (ISS) >16, age 16-65 years, admission within 6 h of the accident and survival >48 h; 55 patients were enrolled. Over 14 days, plasma neopterin and IL-18 levels and the clinical course regarding MODS, SIRS and sepsis were recorded daily using the Marshall Score for MODS and the ACCP/SCCM criteria for SIRS and sepsis.\n\nNeopterin and IL-18 plasma levels were increased in +MODS cases as compared with -MODS cases over almost the entire observation period. IL-18 concentrations over days 3-6 were significantly increased among participants with sepsis. These increases were all apparent 2-3 days before the clinical diagnosis of sepsis or MODS was made. In contrast, no significant differences in neopterin and IL-18 plasma levels were observed between participants with and without SIRS.",
        "To present psychometric information and studies dealing with questionnaires for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and visually impaired patients in addition to the study by Finger et al. \"Quality of life in AMD: a review of available vision-specific psychometric tools\". We propose that their literature search should not have focused solely on the specific eye disease AMD.\n\nThe literature search was partly replicated (PubMed) by using \"visual impairment\" instead of \"macular degeneration\" as free text words. Psychometric information was obtained from the additional studies. Preliminary results from a differential item functioning (DIF) analysis used to examine the relationship between item responses on the Vision-related quality of life Core Measure (VCM1) of AMD patients versus patients with other eye conditions are discussed.\n\nEight studies of visually impaired patient populations, including AMD patients, are discussed, with psychometric information from six vision-specific questionnaires. The VCM1 items did not present DIF, which means that the items were equally interpreted by all patients.",
        "Deep vein thrombosis (DVT), usually asymptomatic, is common after total hip arthroplasty (THA). Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a potential late complication of DVT, but there is limited data on its occurrence.\n\nThis was a prospective cohort study of subjects at one hospital who had participated in a trial of thromboprophylaxis for THA and who had postoperative venography. Data were collected at baseline and 2-4 years later to ascertain symptoms of PTS using a modification of a validated scoring system. Outcomes were collected without knowledge of baseline characteristics or venogram results. Potential predictors of PTS were explored using exact logistic regression analyses.\n\nThe cohort (n=188) had a mean age of 63 years, 51% were male, 35% had a BMI of>30, and 4% had a prior history of DVT. 25 patients (13%) had DVTs on venography. 12 patients (6%, 95% CI: 3-11) subsequently developed symptoms consistent with PTS, 7 with bilateral symptoms. Most affected limbs (15 of 19) had no postoperative DVT. No statistically significant predictors of PTS were found.",
        "High-volume local infiltration analgesia has been shown to be an effective pain treatment after knee replacement, but the role of bandaging to prolong analgesia has not been evaluated.\n\n48 patients undergoing fast-track total knee replacement with high-volume (170 mL) 0.2% ropivacaine infiltration analgesia were randomized to receive a compression or a non-compression bandage, and pain was assessed at rest and with mobilization at regular intervals for 24 h postoperatively.\n\nPain at rest, during flexion, or on straight leg lift was lower for the first 8 h in patients with compression bandage than in those with non-compression bandage and with a similar low use of oxycodone. Mean hospital stay was similar (2.8 days and 3.3 days, respectively).",
        "The present study aimed to investigate possible association of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene polymorphisms with age at natural menopause (ANM) in Caucasian females.\n\nFour SNPs (including two replacements, SNP3 Cys112Arg and SNP4 Arg158Cys) were genotyped in 253 randomly selected unrelated Caucasian women having experienced natural menopause. The comprehensive statistical analyses focusing on the association of the APOE gene and some environmental factors with ANM were conducted.\n\nAlcohol consumption was a significantly predictor of earlier natural menopause (P<0.05). One SNP (rs769450) was significantly associated with ANM according to both population based and the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) analyses (P=0.007 and 0.046, respectively). However, no association was observed between APOE varepsilon2, varepsilon3, varepsilon4 and ANM.",
        "There is evidence to suppose that cholesterol-lowering drugs such as statins might confer protection against dementia, probably via modulation of cholesterol synthesis in the brain. The aim of the present study was to investigate possible influence of two lipophilic statins (simvastatin and atorvastatin) on cholesterol synthesis in selected parts of rat central nervous system (CNS).\n\nThree groups of rats were orally treated with simvastatin (10 mg/kg b.wt.), atorvastatin (10 mg/kg b.wt.) or vehicle (aqua) for 9 days. At the end of experiment, brains (for basal ganglia, frontal cortex and hippocampus) and spinal cord were isolated and cholesterol synthesis was determined using the incorporation of deuterium from deuterated water. ANOVA with Fisher\"s LSD Multiple-Comparison Test and Kruskal-Wallis test were applied for statistical evaluation. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nSignificant reductions of cholesterol synthesis rate were detected in both experimental groups (vs. controls) in all studied localisations. Both drugs elicited comparable effects on cholesterol synthesis rate irrespective of the examined tissue.",
        "We sought to study the epidemiology of scabies and to identify risk factors of severe disease in an impoverished rural community in northeast Brazil.\n\nThe study was designed as a repeated cross-sectional study based on two door-to-door surveys. One survey was carried out in the rainy season, the other in the dry season. The inhabitants of the community were examined for the presence of scabies and demographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral risk factors were assessed. Risk factors were analyzed using bivariate and multivariate regression analysis.\n\nThe overall prevalence was 9.8% with no significant variation between seasons and the incidence was estimated to be 196/1000 person-years. The highest prevalence (18.2%) was observed in children younger than 4 years. Risk factors in the bivariate analysis were young age, presence of many children in the household, illiteracy, low family income, poor housing, sharing clothes and towels, and irregular use of shower. Age younger than 15 years, illiteracy, sharing of clothes, and living in the community for more than 6 months remained significant independent risk factors in multivariate regression analysis.",
        "L-Arginine is an important precursor of nitric oxide (NO) and protein synthesis. Arginine is produced in the body (mainly kidney) by de novo production from citrulline and by protein breakdown. Arginine availability appears to be limited in sepsis.\n\nThe objective was to compare arginine and citrulline metabolism in septic patients and nonseptic control patients in an intensive care unit (ICU) and in healthy control subjects.\n\nTen patients with septic shock, 7 critically ill control patients, and 16 healthy elderly subjects were studied. Metabolism was measured by using a primed continuous (2 h) stable-isotope infusion protocol. NO production was calculated as the conversion rate of arginine to citrulline; de novo arginine production was calculated as the conversion rate of citrulline to arginine. Arterial blood (arterialized venous blood in healthy subjects) was collected for the measurement of amino acid enrichment and concentrations. Data are reported as means +/- SDs.\n\nWhole-body citrulline production was significantly lower in septic patients (4.5 +/- 2.1 micromol . kg(-1) . h(-1)) than in ICU control patients (10.1 +/- 2.9 micromol . kg(-1) . h(-1); P < 0.01) and in healthy control subjects (13.7 +/- 4.1 micromol . kg(-1) . h(-1); P < 0.001). Accordingly, de novo arginine production was lower in patients with sepsis (3.3 +/- 3.7 micromol . kg(-1) . h(-1)) than in healthy controls (11.9 +/- 6.6 micromol . kg(-1) . h(-1); P < 0.01) and tended to be lower in septic patients than in ICU control patients (10.9 +/- 9.4 micromol . kg(-1) . h(-1); P = 0.05). NO production was lower in septic patients than in healthy control subjects (P < 0.01), whereas a larger part of arginine was converted to urea in sepsis.",
        "Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn\"s disease (CD) are polygenic chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) of high prevalence that are associated with considerable morbidity. The hedgehog (HH) signalling pathway, which includes the transcription factor glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (GLI1), plays vital roles in gastrointestinal tract development, homeostasis, and malignancy. We identified a germline variation in GLI1 (within the IBD2 linkage region, 12q13) in patients with IBD. Since this IBD-associated variant encodes a GLI1 protein with reduced function and our expression studies demonstrated down-regulation of the HH response in IBD, we tested whether mice with reduced Gli1 activity demonstrate increased susceptibility to chemically induced colitis.\n\nUsing a gene-wide haplotype-tagging approach, germline GLI1 variation was examined in three independent populations of IBD patients and healthy controls from Northern Europe (Scotland, England, and Sweden) totalling over 5,000 individuals. On log-likelihood analysis, GLI1 was associated with IBD, predominantly UC, in Scotland and England (p < 0.0001). A nonsynonymous SNP (rs2228226C-->G), in exon 12 of GLI1 (Q1100E) was strongly implicated, with pooled odds ratio of 1.194 (confidence interval = 1.09-1.31, p = 0.0002). GLI1 variants were tested in vitro for transcriptional activity in luciferase assays. Q1100E falls within a conserved motif near the C terminus of GLI1; the variant GLI protein exhibited reduced transactivation function in vitro. In complementary expression studies, we noted the colonic HH response, including GLI1, patched (PTCH), and hedgehog-interacting protein (HHIP), to be down-regulated in patients with UC. Finally, Gli1(+/lacZ) mice were tested for susceptibility to dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)-induced colitis. Clinical response, histology, and expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were recorded. Gli1(+/lacZ) mice rapidly developed severe intestinal inflammation, with considerable morbidity and mortality compared with wild type. Local myeloid cells were shown to be direct targets of HH signals and cytokine expression studies revealed robust up-regulation of IL-12, IL-17, and IL-23 in this model.",
        "Grip strength and pinch strength measurements are often used to assess hand function. However, both measure a number of muscle groups in combination, and grip strength in particular is dominated by extrinsic hand muscles. The Rotterdam Intrinsic Hand Myometer (RIHM) was recently introduced to measure the force that individual fingers and thumb can exert in different directions. The aim of this study was to establish the reliability of these measurements with use of the RIHM in children.\n\nSixty-three healthy children between 4 and 12 years of age participated in this study. The RIHM was used to measure thumb palmar abduction, thumb opposition, thumb flexion at the metacarpal-phalangeal (MP) joint, index finger abduction, and little finger abduction. A retest was performed with an average test-retest interval of 26 days.\n\nFor the thumb, palmar abduction strength had intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of .98 for both hands. For both thumb opposition and flexion at the MP joint, ICCs were .97 for the dominant hands and .98 for the nondominant hands. Index finger abduction had ICCs of .94 and .95 and little finger abduction had ICCs of .90 and .92 for the dominant and nondominant hands, respectively. The smallest detectable differences for dominant and nondominant hands respectively were thumb palmar abduction, 15% and 15%; thumb opposition, 12% and 9%; thumb flexion (at the MP joint), 12% and 9%; abduction of the index finger, 17% and 17%; and little finger abduction, 26% and 26%.",
        "Although some studies have reported a negative influence of caffeine on bone metabolism, there is no information about its effect on the progression of periodontitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of high doses of caffeine on ligature-induced periodontitis in rats.\n\nTwenty-two Wistar rats were assigned to one of the following groups: non-caffeine group (n = 12) = animals without caffeine ingestion; caffeine group (n = 10) = animals ingesting 10 mg/100 g body weight/day of caffeine via drinking water for 56 days. Two weeks after the beginning of caffeine intake, one of the mandibular molar was randomly assigned to receive a ligature, whereas the contralateral molar was left unligated. Forty-two days later, the animals were sacrificed, and the specimens were processed to obtain decalcified sections. The area of periodontal ligament and/or bone loss in the furcation region of the first molars was histometrically determined.\n\nCaffeine intake did not have a direct effect on the alveolar bone loss in unligated teeth. But on the ligated tooth, a greater area of bone loss was observed in the animals that ingested caffeine compared to those that did not (P <0.05).",
        "Genetic defects in the oocyte can lead to female infertility due to failures in early embryogenesis. NLRP5 (NLR family, Pyrin domain containing 5) is a maternal effect factor required for early embryo development beyond the 2-cell stage in mice. The NLRP5 gene is conserved in mammals. Applying RNA interference (RNAi) technique in the macaque oocyte, we studied the in vitro effect of NLRP5 in preimplantation embryo development in rhesus macaques.\n\nMacaque MII oocytes were collected and subjected to NLRP5 long double-stranded (ds) RNA microinjection, followed by intracytoplasmic sperm injection and in vitro embryo culture. NLRP5 mRNA and protein expression were examined, and the progress of preimplantation embryo development was monitored until the blastocyst stage.\n\nWhile 46.7 and 41.4% of embryos derived from uninjected and EGFP (Enhanced Green Fluorescence Protein) dsRNA-injected oocytes (control) reached the blastocyst stage within 10 days of culture, respectively, only 7.0% of the NLRP5 knockdown embryos developed to term. The majority of NLRP5 knockdown embryos were arrested between the 8-cell and the 16-cell stages.",
        ": This study observed whether mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) adopt beta-cell fate upon diabetic microenvironment.\n\n: We transplanted male porcine MSCs to diabetic female pigs by directly injecting into pancreas. Recipients\" sera and pancreatic tissue were analyzed to assess the therapeutic effect. Islets were collected from the sections using laser-capture microdissection. The RNAs from these specimens were extracted and analyzed for insulin and pancreas duodenum homeobox 1 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression. SRY gene was detected from the specimens.\n\n: Compared with untreated diabetic controls, blood glucose level decreased greatly in recipients from 18 days (15.44 +/- 0.31 mmol/L vs 16.66 +/- 0.11 mmol/L) and insulin increased from 14 days (0.048 +/- 0.006 U/L vs 0.030 +/- 0.004 U/L). Hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections demonstrated increased islets in recipients and few lymphocytes present. The newly formed islets were smaller than normal islets (47.2 mum +/- 19.6 vs 119.6 +/- 27.7 mum). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed that microdissected cells expressed insulin and pancreas duodenum homeobox 1 mRNA (79.3% +/- 16.2% of control, 65.2% +/- 14.8% of control, respectively). Immunoreactivity showed that the transplanted MSCs expressed insulin. SRY gene and insulin mRNA double-positive cells were found in microdissected cells by fluorescence in situ hybridization.",
        "Recent information indicates that pentoxifylline (PTX) has the ability to suppress inflammation and profibrotic cell proliferation. In this study, we investigated the effect of PTX on tubulointerstitial fibrosis and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in a rat model of obstructive nephropathy.\n\nWistar rats with left ureteral ligation were divided into control and PTX-treated groups. The histopathologic degree of tubulointerstitial fibrosis was scored with PAS and Masson-stained sections. The protein and mRNA for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were semiquantitatively measured with immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. The protein for transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1) and hypoxia-induced factor 1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) was determined by Western blot.\n\nCompared with the control group, PTX treatment reduced fibrosis scores at d 7 and d 14 (P<0.05). The reduction was accompanied by inhibited expression of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGFbeta1), a key cytokine in tubulointerstitial fibrogenesis (P<0.01). Meanwhile, VEGF protein and mRNA in the kidney were increased in the PTX-treated group compared with the control group (P<0.01). PTX up-regulated expression of VEGF mRNA in a dose- and time-dependent manner in cultured HK-2 cells (P<0.01). However, expression of HIF-1alpha (a key transcription factor for VEGF gene expression) was unchanged by PTX treatment. PTX prolonged the half-life of VEGF mRNA by a 1.07-fold increase.",
        "Although splenic angioembolization (SAE) has been introduced and adopted in many trauma centers, the appropriate selection for and utility of SAE in trauma patients remains under debate. This study examined the outcomes of proximal SAE as part of a management algorithm for adult traumatic splenic injury compared with splenectomy.\n\nA retrospective cohort analysis was performed on all hemodynamically stable (HDS) blunt trauma patients with isolated splenic injury and computed tomographic (CT) evidence of active contrast extravasation that presented to a level 1 Trauma Center over a period of 5 years. The cohorts were defined by two separate 30 month periods and included 78 patients seen before (group I) and 76 patients seen after (group II) the introduction of an institutional SAE protocol. Demographics, splenic injury grade, and outcomes of the two groups were compared using Student\"s t test, or chi2 test. Analysis was by intention-to-treat.\n\nSix hundred eighty-two patients with blunt splenic injury were identified; 154 patients (29%) were HDS with CT evidence of active contrast extravasation. Group I (n = 78) was treated with splenectomy and group II (n = 76) was treated with proximal SAE. There was no difference in age (33 +/- 14 vs. 37 +/- 17 years), Injury Severity Score (31 +/- 13 vs. 29 +/- 11), or mortality (18% vs. 15%) between the two groups. However, the incidence of Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) was 4-fold higher in those patients that underwent proximal SAE compared with those that underwent splenectomy (22% vs. 5%, p = 0.002). Twenty two patients failed nonoperative management (NOM) after SAE. This failure appeared to be directly related to the grade of splenic organ injury (grade I and II: 0%; grade III: 24%; grade IV: 53%; and grade V: 100%).",
        "Treatment of scapholunate dissociation remains difficult. The modified Brunelli procedure, a flexor carpi radialis tenodesis through the scaphoid and secured with dorsal wrist ligaments, has shown promising results. This study compares the biomechanical effects on scaphoid flexion and scapholunate gap between proximal and distal tunnel placement in the modified Brunelli procedure.\n\nEight fresh-frozen cadaveric forearms were used. A dorsal approach to the wrist through the floor of the fourth compartment was used. Metallic markers were implanted into the scaphoid and lunate. Tunnels were drilled through the proximal and distal poles of the scaphoid. Wrists were positioned in neutral and loaded to 100 N through the wrist flexor and extensor tendons. Posteroanterior and lateral radiographs were taken with the scapholunate interval intact, with the scapholunate interval sectioned, and after the modified Brunelli tenodesis was performed through the proximal and then distal tunnels using Mersilene tape. Radiographs were analyzed for change in scapholunate angle and scapholunate gap. Multivariate analysis of variance was performed to assess statistical significance for each state compared with the intact wrist.\n\nIn the intact wrist, the mean scapholunate gap was 1.6 mm +/- 0.1. With the scapholunate interval sectioned, the scapholunate angle increased by 26 degrees +/- 12 and gap increased to 4.2 mm +/- 1.2. With a proximal tunnel for the modified Brunelli procedure, the change in scapholunate angle decreased to 15 degrees +/- 10 and gap decreased to 1.8 mm +/- 0.3. With a distal tunnel for the modified Brunelli procedure, the change in scapholunate angle decreased to 4 degrees +/- 7 and gap decreased to 1.3 mm +/- 0.2.",
        "Adiponectin is a circulating protein with hepatoprotective effects.\n\nTo study the relationship of excessive alcohol consumption and serum adiponectin levels (SAL).\n\nThe SAL were determined in (i) heavy drinkers without advanced liver damage during the course of alcohol withdrawal, (ii) patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, (iii) patients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis, and (iv) healthy volunteers that consumed excessive amounts of alcohol for only a short period of time. Further, primary human hepatocytes (PHH) and adipocytes were incubated in vitro with alcohol or serum of patients.\n\nPatients with chronic alcohol consumption had significantly higher SAL than HCV-patients with comparable degrees of liver damage. In alcoholics, but not in HCV patients, SAL positively correlated with serum levels of aminotransferases. Further, SAL correlated with the amount of alcohol consumption but declined during the course of alcohol abstinence. After short-term excessive alcohol consumption SAL were not elevated in healthy individuals. Adiponectin mRNA was detectable in adipocytes but not in hepatocytes, and alcohol failed to induce adiponectin in both cell types. In contrast, serum of active drinkers induced adiponectin expression in adipocytes while serum from the same individuals collected after alcohol withdrawal had no effect.",
        "We studied whether an increase in adenosine dose overcomes caffeine antagonism on adenosine-mediated coronary vasodilation.\n\nCaffeine is a competitive antagonist at the adenosine receptors, but it is unclear whether caffeine in coffee alters the actions of exogenous adenosine, and whether the antagonism can be surmounted by increasing the adenosine dose.\n\nMyocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) was used to assess adenosine-induced hyperemia in 30 patients before (baseline) and after coffee ingestion (caffeine). At baseline, patients received 140 microg/kg/min of adenosine combined with low-level exercise. For the caffeine study, 12 patients received 140 microg/kg/min of adenosine (standard) and 18 patients received 210 microg/kg/min (high dose) after caffeine intake (200 mg). Myocardial perfusion was assessed semiquantitatively and quantitatively, and perfusion defect was characterized according to the presence of reversibility.\n\nCaffeine reduced the magnitude of perfusion abnormality induced by standard adenosine as measured by the summed difference score (SDS) (12.0 +/- 4.4 at baseline vs. 4.1 +/- 2.1 after caffeine, p < 0.001) as well as defect size (18% [3% to 38%] vs. 8% [0% to 22%], p < 0.01), whereas it had no effect on the abnormalities caused by high-dose adenosine (SDS, 7.7 +/- 4.0 at baseline vs. 7.8 +/- 4.2 after caffeine, p = 0.7). There was good agreement between baseline and caffeine studies for segmental defect category (kappa = 0.72, 95% confidence interval: 0.65 to 0.79) in the high-dose group. An increase in adenosine after caffeine intake was well tolerated.",
        "Hip dislocation in nonambulatory multiply handicapped children (particularly in cerebral palsy [CP]) is a common and severe problem involving painful transportation and uneasy positioning, usually resulting from major anatomical osteoarticular and soft tissue disorders. Therefore, proximal femoral resection is seen as a salvage procedure whose primary purpose is to provide children and their caregivers with better comfort during activities of daily living thus allowing improved sitting tolerance in the wheelchair and painless nursing care.\n\nA series of 21 proximal femoral resections performed on 16 patients with a mean age at surgery of 12 years, and a follow-up period of 21 years (from 1984 to 2005) were retrospectively reviewed. All patients suffered from painful dislocation of the hip. Sixteen of the hips (76%) had been managed previously with bony and soft tissue surgery. Femoral resection was performed in the basicervical region in eight hips and distal to the lesser trochanter in 13 hips.\n\nAt a mean follow-up of five years and eight months, 18 of the 21 painful hips reported to be painless (86%). All preoperative stiffness and deformity of the hip joints was corrected, resulting in floppy, mobile hips with an increased range of motion after surgery. Femoral stump, regarding the acetabulum was above in three hips, at the same level in 18 and never below. The proximal end of the femoral shaft could often been palpated but did not reveal any skin irritation. The formation of heterotopic bone was discernible in five hips (24%). However, it did not affect the functional outcomes.",
        "Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a transmembrane protein that participates in the recognition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potentially important source of inflammation. To investigate the role of TLR4 in LPS-induced airway mucus hypersecretion (AMH), we used a LPS-induced rat model treated with dexamethasone (DEX).\n\nRats were randomly divided into four experimental groups: 1) saline (SA)-treated with distilled water (DW) (control group); 2) LPS-treated with DW (LPS group); 3) LPS-treated with DEX (LPS plus DEX group); 4) SA-treated with DEX (DEX group). DEX (5 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally injected 1 h before being administered intratracheally with LPS. Expressions of TLR4 and MUC5AC were evaluated with RT-PCR, in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry and Alcian blue/Periodic acid-schiff (AB/PAS) staining.\n\nIncreased expressions of TLR4 protein and mRNA were found in rat airway treated with LPS and peaked on day 2 after LPS administration. Following this, LPS increased MUC5AC expression and AB/PAS-stained goblet cells in rat airway. Correlation analysis showed TLR4 correlated well with the expression of MUC5AC (r = 0.684, p <0.01) and AB/PAS-stained area (r = 0.781, p <0.01). In addition, DEX pretreatment significantly reduced LPS-induced overexpression of TLR4 (p <0.05) in rat airway.",
        "Zebrafish mutants generated by ethylnitrosourea-mutagenesis provide a powerful tool for dissecting the genetic regulation of developmental processes, including organogenesis. One zebrafish mutant, \"flotte lotte\" (flo), displays striking defects in intestinal, liver, pancreas, and eye formation at 78 hours postfertilization (hpf). In this study, we sought to identify the underlying mutated gene in flo and link the genetic lesion to its phenotype.\n\nPositional cloning was employed to map the flo mutation. Subcellular characterization of flo embryos was achieved using histology, immunocytochemistry, bromodeoxyuridine incorporation analysis, and confocal and electron microscopy.\n\nThe molecular lesion in flo is a nonsense mutation in the elys (embryonic large molecule derived from yolk sac) gene, which encodes a severely truncated protein lacking the Elys C-terminal AT-hook DNA binding domain. Recently, the human ELYS protein has been shown to play a critical, and hitherto unsuspected, role in nuclear pore assembly. Although elys messenger RNA (mRNA) is expressed broadly during early zebrafish development, widespread early defects in flo are circumvented by the persistence of maternally expressed elys mRNA until 24 hpf. From 72 hpf, elys mRNA expression is restricted to proliferating tissues, including the intestinal epithelium, pancreas, liver, and eye. Cells in these tissues display disrupted nuclear pore formation; ultimately, intestinal epithelial cells undergo apoptosis.",
        "The relation between variation in interindividual levels of energy expenditure and weight gain remains controversial.\n\nTo determine whether or not components of the energy budget predict weight change, we conducted an international comparative study in 2 cohorts of women from sociocultural environments that give rise to the extremes of obesity prevalence.\n\nThis was a prospective study with energy expenditure measured at baseline and weight measured annually for 3 y. Participants included 149 women from rural Nigeria and 172 African American women. The energy budget was determined by using respiratory gas exchange and doubly labeled water. Main outcomes included total, resting, and activity energy expenditure and physical activity level (ie, total energy expenditure/resting energy expenditure); baseline anthropometric measures; and annual weight change.\n\nMean body mass index (in kg/m(2)) was 23 among the Nigerians and 31 among the African Americans; the prevalences of obesity were 7% and 50%, respectively. After adjustment for body size, no differences in mean activity energy expenditure or physical activity level were observed between the 2 cohorts. In addition, in a mixed-effects, random-coefficient model, interindividual variation in activity energy expenditure at baseline was unrelated to the subsequent pattern of weight change.",
        "Variants downstream of the melanocortin-4 receptor gene (MC4R) have been reported to associate with obesity. We examined rs17782313, rs17700633, rs12970134, rs477181, rs502933, and rs4450508 near MC4R for association with obesity-related quantitative traits, obesity, and type 2 diabetes in Danish individuals.\n\nThe variants were investigated for association with obesity-related quantitative traits in 5,807 population-based sampled individuals, obesity in 14,940 individuals, and type 2 diabetes in 8,821 individuals.\n\nThe minor risk alleles of rs17782313, rs17700633, and rs12970134 were associated with BMI (effect per allele 0.25 kg/m2, P = 0.01; 0.23, P = 0.01; and 0.31, P = 7 x 10(-4), respectively), waist circumference (0.67 cm, P = 0.006; 0.53, P = 0.02; and 0.85, P = 3 x 10(-4)), and body weight (1.04 kg, P = 6 x 10(-4); 0.71, P = 0.01; and 1.16, P = 8 x 10(-5)). In case-control studies of obesity defined by BMI, the minor C-allele of rs17782313 was associated with overweight/obesity and obesity (odds ratio [OR] 1.09, P = 0.006 and OR 1.12, P = 0.003, respectively). Similarly, the minor A-allele of rs17700633 was associated with overweight/obesity and obesity (1.12, P = 8 x 10(-5) and 1.16, P = 2 x 10(-5)), and the minor A-allele of rs12970134 was also associated with overweight/obesity and obesity (1.13, P = 2 x 10(-5) and 1.15, P = 6 x 10(-5)). rs477181, rs502933, and rs4450508 were not significantly associated with obesity in the Danish population. The frequency of the minor risk alleles of rs17782313 and rs12970134 was higher among patients with type 2 diabetes than among glucose-tolerant individuals (OR 1.08, P = 0.08 and 1.08, P = 0.06, respectively); however, these borderline associations were abolished after adjustment for BMI.",
        "Insulin secretion involves complex events in which the mitochondria play a pivotal role in the generation of signals that couple glucose detection to insulin secretion. Studies on the mitochondrial generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generally focus on chronic nutrient exposure. Here, we investigate whether transient mitochondrial ROS production linked to glucose-induced increased respiration might act as a signal for monitoring insulin secretion.\n\nROS production in response to glucose was investigated in freshly isolated rat islets. ROS effects were studied using a pharmacological approach and calcium imaging.\n\nTransient glucose increase from 5.5 to 16.7 mmol/l stimulated ROS generation, which was reversed by antioxidants. Insulin secretion was dose dependently blunted by antioxidants and highly correlated with ROS levels. The incapacity of beta-cells to secrete insulin in response to glucose with antioxidants was associated with a decrease in ROS production and in contrast to the maintenance of high levels of ATP and NADH. Then, we investigated the mitochondrial origin of ROS (mROS) as the triggering signal. Insulin release was mimicked by the mitochondrial-complex blockers, antimycin and rotenone, that generate mROS. The adding of antioxidants to mitochondrial blockers or to glucose was used to lower mROS reversed insulin secretion. Finally, calcium imaging on perifused islets using glucose stimulation or mitochondrial blockers revealed that calcium mobilization was completely reversed using the antioxidant trolox and that it was of extracellular origin. No toxic effects were present using these pharmacological approaches.",
        "The objective is to verify the cardiac troponin I values in children less than 1 year of age without clinical cardiac dysfunction.\n\nThe cardiac troponin I values were determined in 99 children less than 1 year of age, including term infants without diseases related to cardiac dysfunction using the specific kit Opus T Troponin I (cTn) (Dade Behring Inc. -Newalk, DE 19714, USA).\n\nAll children have values of cardiac troponin I less than 0.1 ng/ml.",
        "An intercostal muscle (ICM) flap is used to buttress the bronchial stump or bronchial anastomosis during thoracic surgery for airway reconstruction. Such flaps sometimes show ossification after surgery. Previous reports have suggested that such ossification requires a functional periosteum and good vascularization. We examined the background of ICM flap ossification and its relationship with complications and pain after surgery.\n\nWe surveyed the clinical records of 47 patients who underwent bronchial stump reinforcement with an ICM flap during thoracic surgery at Kansai Medical University Hospital between January 2003 and December 2005. We reviewed the post-surgical chest computed tomography (CT) scans of 42 patients, and examined the degree of ICM ossification. We classified patients into two groups: those with ossification of the ICM flap (O group) and those without (non-O group). We compared the two groups for age, gender, the site of ICM flap placement, disease, type of lymph node dissection, and pretreatment. We also compared the two groups for pain levels and complications after surgery. Eight (19%) of the 42 patients showed ossification of the ICM after surgery. There were statistically significant differences between the O and non-O groups in gender (p=0.029), lymph node dissection (p=0.024) and pain levels after surgery (p=0.034). There were no complications attributable to ICM ossification in this series.",
        "We sought to study the association between brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels and the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) and an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD).\n\nThis was a prospective study of consecutive, stable, ambulatory patients with moderate and severe ischemic LVD and an ICD. A plasma BNP level was obtained at recruitment. Patients were evaluated every 3-6 mo for a minimum of 1 y. The primary end point was the occurrence of malignant ventricular arrhythmia or sudden cardiac death (SCD).\n\nThe cohort consisted of 94 subjects (6 women) with a mean +/- standard deviation (SD) age of 69 +/- 10 y. The ICD implantation indication was primary and secondary prevention of SCD in 49% and 51% of subjects, respectively. A primary end point occurred in 27 patients (29%), and was more frequent in symptomatic heart failure patients and those implanted for secondary prevention of SCD. The median BNP level was significantly higher among patients who experienced an end point (191 pg/ml versus 142 pg/ml, p = 0.03). After controlling for New York Heart Association heart failure class and ICD implantation indication, the odds ratio (OR) for experiencing an adverse outcome among the upper BNP quartile versus all others was 3.5 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2-10.2). Among patients implanted for primary prevention of SCD, none of the patients in the lower BNP quartile (BNP < 91 pg/ml) experienced an adverse outcome.",
        "Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a well-recognised mediator of liver disease and regeneration. However, the in vivo effects of IL-6 on enterocytes and the intestinal tract have not been elucidated. We sought to determine the in vivo effects of IL-6 on enterocytes.\n\nMurine models of increased or absent IL-6 were examined.\n\nSystemic, high-dose IL-6 administration to mice over 7-10 days resulted in intestinal hyperplasia with a approximately 40% increase in small bowel mass and in intestinal villus height. No increase in crypt cell proliferation was noted. IL-6 administration was associated with induction of pSTAT3 in enterocytes along the lower and middle regions of villi but not in crypts. IL-6 administration was also associated with induction of anti-apoptotic proteins including pAKT, and FLIP along with decreased executor caspase activity and PARP cleavage. Pulse bromodeoxyuridine labelling demonstrated equivalent crypt cell proliferation rates but prolonged enterocyte lifespan and slowed enterocyte migration rates in IL-6 treated mice. Furthermore, IL-6 treated mice showed less intestinal injury and improved barrier function following ischaemia reperfusion of the small bowel. Conversely, Il6 null mice exhibited impaired recovery following massive enterectomy and increased apoptosis after 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy relative to wild-type controls.",
        "Patients with type 2 diabetes are under high oxidative stress, and levels of hyperglycemia correlate strongly with levels of LDL oxidation. Carnitine favorably modulates oxidative stress.\n\nThis objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of L-carnitine on the reduction of oxidized LDL cholesterol in patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\nEighty-one patients with diabetes were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups for 3 mo. The 2 groups received either 2 g L-carnitine once daily (n = 41) or placebo (n = 40). The following variables were assessed at baseline, after washout, and at 1, 2, and 3 mo of treatment: body mass index, fasting plasma glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein A1, apolipoprotein B-100, oxidized LDL cholesterol, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, and conjugated dienes.\n\nAt the end of the study period, the L-carnitine-treated patients showed significant improvements compared with the placebo group in the following markers: oxidized LDL levels decreased by 15.1 compared with 3.0 U/L (P < 0.001); LDL cholesterol decreased by 0.45 compared with 0.16 mmol/L (P < 0.05); triglycerides decreased by 1.02 compared with 0.09 mmol/L (P < 0.001); apolipoprotein A1 concentrations decreased by 0.12 compared with 0.03 mg/dL (P < 0.05); apolipoprotein B-100 concentrations decreased by 0.13 compared with 0.04 mg/dL (P < 0.05); thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance concentrations decreased by 1.92 compared with 0.05 (P < 0.001), and conjugated diene concentrations decreased by 0.72 compared with 0.11 in the placebo group (P < 0.001).",
        "Short sleep is associated with obesity and may alter the endocrine regulation of hunger and appetite.\n\nWe tested the hypothesis that the curtailment of human sleep could promote excessive energy intake.\n\nEleven healthy volunteers [5 women, 6 men; mean +/- SD age: 39 +/- 5 y; mean +/- SD body mass index (in kg/m(2)): 26.5 +/- 1.5] completed in random order two 14-d stays in a sleep laboratory with ad libitum access to palatable food and 5.5-h or 8.5-h bedtimes. The primary endpoints were calories from meals and snacks consumed during each bedtime condition. Additional measures included total energy expenditure and 24-h profiles of serum leptin and ghrelin.\n\nSleep was reduced by 122 +/- 25 min per night during the 5.5-h bedtime condition. Although meal intake remained similar (P = 0.51), sleep restriction was accompanied by increased consumption of calories from snacks (1087 +/- 541 compared with 866 +/- 365 kcal/d; P = 0.026), with higher carbohydrate content (65% compared with 61%; P = 0.04), particularly during the period from 1900 to 0700. These changes were not associated with a significant increase in energy expenditure (2526 +/- 537 and 2390 +/- 369 kcal/d during the 5.5-h and 8.5-h bedtime periods, respectively; P = 0.58), and we found no significant differences in serum leptin and ghrelin between the 2 sleep conditions.",
        "The cytotoxicity of single and repeated administration of bevacizumab to retinal ganglion cells was studied in vivo and in vitro.\n\nRats received single or repeated injections of 125 microg of bevacizumab into the vitreous cavity of the left eye, while saline was injected into the right eye as a control. In the repeated injection group, bevacizumab was injected at the same concentration once per week for 4 weeks. Retinal ganglion cells were retrogradely labeled with Fluorogold dye, and counted after kill at 0 and 6 months after treatment. In the in vitro study, PC12 cells were cultured in various concentrations of bevacizumab (0, 1, 2, 5, and 10 mg/mL) to model retinal ganglion cells exposure. Cell viability in each group was assessed by an MTT assay.\n\nThere was no significant difference in retinal ganglion cell numbers between control and bevacizumab-treated eyes following either single or repeated injection, or did bevacizumab have any significant influence on PC12 cell viability in vitro.",
        "We investigated the relationship between the magnitude of comprehensive hepatitis C virus (HCV)-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses and the clinical course of acute HCV infection.\n\nSix consecutive patients with acute HCV infection were studied. Analysis of HCV-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses was performed using an interferon-gamma-based enzyme-linked immunospot assay using peripheral CD8(+) T-cells, monocytes and 297 20-mer synthetic peptides overlapping by 10 residues and spanning the entire HCV sequence of genotype 1b.\n\nFive patients presented detectable HCV-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses against a single and different peptide, whereas 1 patient showed responses against three different peptides. Neither the magnitude of HCV-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses nor the severity of hepatitis predicts the outcome of acute hepatitis. The maximum number of HCV-specific CD8(+) T-cells correlated with maximum serum alanine aminotransferase level during the course (r = 0.841, P = 0.036).",
        "We investigated lipid metabolism in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV), serotype 1, undergoing combination therapy with PEG-IFN alpha-2b (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV).\n\nA total of 185 patients with chronic HCV (HCV serotype 1; HCV RNA levels >/= 100 KIU/mL) who received a combination of PEG-IFN and RBV were enrolled.\n\nSustained virological response (SVR) was obtained in 82 cases (44.3%). The median age, red blood cell and platelet counts differed significantly between the SVR and non-SVR groups before treatment. However there was no significant difference between total cholesterol (TC), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglyceride (TG) levels before treatment. TC and LDL-C levels decreased during the treatment in both groups. In the SVR group, TC and LDL-C levels increased quickly after the end of the treatment and were higher than those before treatment. On the other hand, TC and LDL-C levels returned to pretreatment levels in the non-SVR group and were significantly lower than in the SVR group. TG levels were elevated in both groups after the beginning of treatment. After the end of treatment, this elevation persisted in the SVR group, while TG levels returned to pre-treatment levels in the non-SVR group. There was a significant difference in TG levels at 24 weeks after the end of the treatment between the 2 groups. In the non-SVR group some patients achieved normalization of ALT (alanine aminotransferase) but persistence of normal ALT levels did not contribute to the increase of TC and TG.",
        "To investigate the effects of ginsenoside R(g1) on the transdifferentiation of rat renal tubular epethelial cells induced by transforming growth factor-beta1, (TGF-beta1).\n\nCultured normal rat renal tubular epethelial cells (NRK-52E) were divided into control group, TGF-beta1-induced group and treated with ginsenoside R(g1) at different concentration (10, 20, 40 mg x L(-1)) group. The morphology of tubular epithelial-myofibroblast transdifferentiation induced by TGF-beta1 was observed through light microscope. alpha-SMA and E-cadherin protein expression were assessed by immunohistochemistry and western blot analyses. alpha-SMA, collagen I and and fibronectin gene expression were assessed by real-time quantitative chain reaction. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to quantitatively detect collagen I and fibronectin in the supernatant.\n\n10 mg x L(-1) TGF-beta1 could induce the transdifferentiation of tubular epithelial myofibroblast, showing fibroblast-like in morphology, with significantly enhanced expression of alpha-SMA, depressed expression of E-cadherin and increased secretion of fibronectin and collagen I (P < 0.05). Compared to TGF-beta1-induced group, ginsenoside R(g1) partly abrogated the alpha-SMA expression and E-cadherin depression triggered by TGF-beta1 in tubular epithelial cells in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05). Meanhile, ginsenoside R(g1) blocked morphologic transformation of tubular epithelial cells and decreased levels of collagen I and fibronectin (P < 0.05).",
        "Dipstick urine analysis is the most common and convenient examination in routine health care. The criteria for abnormal proteinuria is a level of more than (+). However, the interference of urine concentration should be considered in the judgement.\n\nThe purpose is to demonstrate the effect of the combined use of specific gravity (SG) in the dipstick judgement to evaluate pathological proteinuria in Japanese people.\n\nThe hospital laboratory database of Kitano hospital was searched for urine samples, for patients consulted at our nephrology department from Oct. 2004 to Sep. 2005 (n=1767), and simultaneously assayed for dipstick proteinuria(DSP), SG, urinary protein, urine creatinine (UC) and urinary protein-creatinine ratio (UPC ratio). To generate a model table, samples were stratified according to DSP and SG values. A DSP versus SG matrix (5 x 6)was created, and then all 30 cells were color-coded by the pathological proteinuria proportion (white: < 5%, gray: 5-95%, black: <95%).\n\nSG was positively associated with UC. In the patients, SG < or = 1.005 and DSP(-), 12/70 (17.1%) was > or =300 mg/gCr. Moreover in the patients, both 1.005 < SG < or = 1.010 and DSP(+/-), 21/32 (65.6%) had pathological proteinuria. We confirmed the consistency for this combination table in the urine samples of another 1111 out-patients. Moreover, the area under the curve in DSP(+/-) suggests that the patients whose SG was < or = 1.011 might have pathological proteinuria (sensitivity; 82.1%, specificity; 89.3%).",
        "Structural brain abnormalities are already present at early phases of psychosis and might be the consequence of neurodevelopmental deviance. Neuregulin 1 gene (NRG1) is a candidate gene for schizophrenia, and its protein has different roles in nervous system development and plasticity. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within NRG1, SNP8NRG243177, has been associated with brain function among healthy and high-risk subjects and with reduced cell migration among patients with schizophrenia. We examined whether variations in this polymorphism influence brain volumes in first-episode schizophrenia subjects.\n\nNinety-five minimally medicated patients experiencing their first episode of schizophrenia underwent genotyping of three SNPs within the NRG1 gene and structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A comparison of volumes of lobar gray matter (GM), lateral ventricles, and cortical cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was made between the groups according to their genotype after controlling for total intracranial volume.\n\nThe SNP8NRG243177 risk T allele was significantly associated, in an allele copy number-dependent fashion, with increased lateral ventricle volume. Genotype explained 7% of the variance of lateral ventricle volume. No significant differences in GM lobar or cortical CSF volumes were found among subgroups.",
        "Ischemic preconditioning has been well established in healthy human hearts, but limited information is available about its occurrence or its integrity in the brain. The aim of the present study was therefore to investigate whether a prior cerebral ischemic episode (stroke or transient ischemic attack [TIA]) is able to confer protection against ischemic stroke, reflected by in-hospital case fatality.\n\nA total of 2874 acute stroke patients included in the prospective, hospital-based Debrecen Stroke Database were studied, of whom 673 had previous stroke and 195 had prior TIA.\n\nFollowing adjustment for active confounders, TIA but not stroke in the history was associated with decreased odds for in-hospital case fatality (odds ratio, 0.53; 95% confidence interval: 0.29-0.98; P = 0.041). The fitness of the final multiple regression model was good (Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit chi(2) statistic (P = 0.328).",
        "Triiodothyronine (T3) is used to potentiate the clinical effect of antidepressant drugs. Inter-individual differences in efficacy may be related to genetically-based variability in thyroid function.\n\nDNA was obtained from 64 patients treated with sertraline plus T3 (SERT-T3, N=35) or plus placebo (SERT-PLB, N=29), for 8 weeks. Antidepressant efficacy was rated with the 21 item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-21). Functional polymorphisms in type 1 (DIO1-C785T, DIO1-A1814G) and type 2 deiodinase (DIO2-Thr92Ala and DIO2-ORFa-Gly3Asp) were genotyped.\n\nDIO1-C785T was associated with efficacy of T3 but not placebo supplementation, as indicated by the interaction of treatment, DIO1-C758T genotype and time (p=0.04) and a stronger effect of SERT-T3 among DIO1-758T allele carriers (p=0.01).

The general condition of S180-bearing mice was observed. The white blood cells, red blood cells, and reticulocytes in the peripheral blood were counted, and the ratio of reticulocytes was measured too. The life-span of the S180-bearing mice was recorded.\n\nThe white blood cell count and the ratio of reticulocytes in 5-FU plus RPM group were higher than those in 5-FU group (P<0.01). The average lifespan of 5-FU plus RPM group was 32.5 days and that of the 5-FU group was 23.5 days; there was a significant difference in the lifespan between the two groups (P<0.01).",
        "To investigate whether levels of psychosocial impairment and psychological distress at diagnosis in those with vasovagal syncope (VVS) predict subsequent response to conventional treatment.\n\nThis is a prospective, observational new patient cohort study, which includes consecutive patients with head-up tilt-confirmed VVS (September 2004-March 2006). Subjects completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, State and trait anxiety inventory, and an Adapted Syncope Functional Status Questionnaire at diagnosis and at 3 months. A total of 108 participants [mean (SD) age 52 (21) years, 70.4% were female] completed baseline assessments. Response status was ascertained for 103 individuals; 70 were responders and 33 non-responders. Eighty-three of 103 participants (81%) completed the follow-up questionnaires. At follow-up, compared with responders, non-responders reported higher levels of Impairment (P = 0.001), negative cognitions (P = 0.01), and depression scores (P = 0.006). At diagnosis those who ultimately did not respond to treatment reported significantly higher levels of Impairment (P < 0.001) and negative cognitions (P = 0.03). Those who did not respond to treatment were significantly more depressed (P = 0.001) with higher Trait anxiety scores (P = 0.007). Multivariate analysis confirmed increased impairment predicted poor response status (z = 9.82, P = 0.002) with participants being 3% more likely to be a non-responder with each 1% increase in self-reported level of impairment.",

Moreover, TIPS placement enhanced renal function and thereby decreased systemic SDMA levels. In patients with renal dysfunction before TIPS placement, both the arginine/ADMA ratio and creatinine clearance rate increased significantly, while this was not the case in patients with normal renal function before TIPS placement. Hepatic function did not change significantly after TIPS placement and no significant decline in ADMA plasma levels was measured.",
        "A large percentage of patients with recurrent ovarian cancer develop resistance to the taxane class of chemotherapeutics. While mechanisms of resistance are being discovered, novel treatment options and a better understanding of disease resistance are sorely needed. The mitotic kinase Aurora-A directly regulates cellular processes targeted by the taxanes and is overexpressed in several malignancies, including ovarian cancer. Recent data has shown that overexpression of Aurora-A can confer resistance to the taxane paclitaxel.\n\nWe used expression profiling of ovarian tumor samples to determine the most significantly overexpressed genes. In this study we sought to determine if chemical inhibition of the Aurora kinase family using VE-465 could synergize with paclitaxel to induce apoptosis in paclitaxel-resistant and sensitive ovarian cancer cells.\n\nAurora-A kinase and TPX2, an activator of Aurora-A, are two of the most significantly overexpressed genes in ovarian carcinomas. We show that inhibition of the Aurora kinases prevents phosphorylation of a mitotic marker and demonstrate a dose-dependent increase of apoptosis in treated ovarian cancer cells. We demonstrate at low doses that are specific to Aurora-A, VE-465 synergizes with paclitaxel to induce 4.5-fold greater apoptosis than paclitaxel alone in 1A9 cells. Higher doses are needed to induce apoptosis in paclitaxel-resistant PTX10 cells.",

Measurement of P and E(2) levels in the conditioned media by RIA and determination of cell proliferation by tritied thymidine incorporation.\n\nHuman GCs express adiponectin receptors AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 but not adiponectin. In primary human GCs, adiponectin increases P and E(2) secretion in response to insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). This was associated with an increase in the p450 aromatase protein level but not those of p450scc, 3 beta HSD, or StAR. Adiponectin treatment does not affect IGF-1-induced cell proliferation and basal steroidogenesis (no IGF-1 or FSH stimulation). Adiponectin rapidly stimulates MAPK ERK1/2 and p38 phosphorylation in primary human GCs.",
        "Hypertension is a risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD), but the causes of hypertension remain largely unknown. Genetic variation is thought to contribute to the etiology of hypertension. We tested a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (Lys67Arg, rs197922) in the Golgi SNAP Receptor Complex Member 2 (GOSR2) gene for association with hypertension and blood pressure (BP). We chose this SNP because it was nominally associated with CHD in earlier studies. Further, GOSR2 is located in a linkage region for hypertension and BP in human and animal studies.\n\nWe used logistic and linear regression to test associations of the GOSR2 SNP with hypertension and BP among 3,528 blacks and 9,861 whites from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. Race-specific regression models of hypertension were adjusted for age and gender. Regression models of BP were further adjusted for antihypertensive medication use.\n\nThe GOSR2 Lys67 allele was associated with hypertension in whites (odds ratio (OR) = 1.09, P = 0.01) but not blacks (OR = 0.96, P = 0.47). The Lys67 allele was associated with increased systolic BP (SBP) in both races (0.87 mm Hg, P < 0.001 among whites and 1.05 mm Hg, P = 0.05 among blacks). A similar association in whites was observed for the GOSR2 SNP and SBP in the Women\"s Genome Health Study (WGHS) (OR = 1.03, P = 0.04). The OR remained unchanged after adjustment for antihypertensive medication use (OR = 1.03, P = 0.11), though it was no longer statistically significant.",
        "Medication errors constitute a major problem in all hospitals. Between 20% and 46% of prescriptions requiring dosage adjustments based on renal function are inappropriate. This study aimed to determine whether implementing alerts at the time of ordering medication integrated into the computerized physician order entry decreases the proportion of inappropriate prescriptions based on the renal function of inpatients.\n\nSix alternating 2-month control and intervention periods were conducted between August 2006 and August 2007 in two medical departments of a teaching hospital in France. A total of 603 patients and 38 physicians were included. During the intervention periods, alerts were triggered if a patient with renal impairment was prescribed one of the 24 targeted drugs that required adjustment according to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).\n\nThe main outcome measure was the proportion of inappropriate first prescriptions, according to recommendation.\n\nA total of 1,122 alerts were triggered. The rate of inappropriate first prescriptions did not differ significantly between intervention and control periods (19.9% vs. 21.3%; p=0.63). The effect of intervention differed significantly between residents and senior physicians (p=0.03). Residents tended to make fewer errors in intervention versus control periods (Odds ratio 0.69; 95% confidence interval 0.41 to 1.15), whereas senior physicians tended to make more inappropriate prescriptions in intervention periods (odds ratio 1.88; 95% confidence interval 0.91 to 3.89).",
        "Febrile seizures (FS) are the most common form of childhood convulsions. Many reports have shown that a proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1 (IL-1) beta, may have a facilitatory effect on the development of FS. We have previously shown that the IL1B -511C/T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is associated with simple FS of sporadic occurrence. The balance between pro- and antiinflammatory cytokines influences the regulation of infections and could, therefore, play a role in the pathogenesis of FS. Here, to determine whether pro- and antiinflammatory cytokine genes are responsible for the susceptibility to FS, we have performed an association study on functional SNPs of cytokine genes in FS patients and controls.\n\nThe promoter SNPs of four inflammatory cytokine genes (IL6 -572C/G, IL8 -251A/T, IL10 -592A/C and TNFA -1037C/T) were examined in 249 patients with FS (186 simple and 63 complex FS) and 225 controls. Because the IL10 -592 SNP showed a positive association with FS, two additional SNPs (IL10 -1082A/G and -819T/C) were subjected to haplotype analysis. Furthermore, we examined the in vivo role of IL-10 in hyperthermia-induced seizures using immature animal models.\n\nThe frequencies of the IL10 -592C allele and -1082A/-819C/-592C haplotype were significantly decreased in FS as compared with in controls (p = 0.014 and 0.013, respectively). The seizure threshold temperature in the IL-10-administered rats was significantly higher than that in the saline-treated control ones (p = 0.027).",
        "The resting partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (Petco2) has been shown to reflect cardiac performance in acute care settings in patients with heart failure (HF). The purpose of the present study was to compare the prognostic ability of the partial pressure of Petco2 at rest to other commonly collected resting variables in patients with systolic HF.\n\nA total of 353 patients (mean age 58.6+/-13.7, 72% male) with systolic HF were included in this study. All patients underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing where New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, resting Petco2, peak oxygen consumption, and the minute ventilation/carbon dioxide production slope were determined. Subjects were then followed for major cardiac events (mortality, left ventricular assist device implantation implantation, urgent heart transplantation).\n\nThere were 104 major cardiac events during the 23.6+/-17.0-month tracking period. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed NYHA class (chi2 28.7, P<.001), left ventricular ejection fraction (residual chi2 21.7, P<.001), and resting Petco2 (residual chi2 14.1, P<.001) were all prognostically significant and retained in the regression. In a separate Cox regression analysis, left ventricular ejection fraction (residual chi2 8.8, P=.003), NYHA class (residual chi2 7.7, P=.005), and resting Petco2 (residual chi2 5.7, P=.02) added prognostic value to the minute ventilation/carbon dioxide production slope (chi2 26.0, P<.001).",

        "Smooth muscle 22 alpha (SM22 alpha) is not required for the development and basal homeostatic function of smooth muscle cells (SMCs). However, a recent study demonstrated that SM22 alpha plays a role in inhibiting the phenotypic modulation of vascular SMCs (VSMCs) from contractile to synthetic/proliferative cells. The present study investigated the mechanism underlying the SM22 alpha-mediated maintenance of the contractile phenotype of VSMCs.\n\nThe redifferentiation of synthetic SMCs was induced by serum deprivation for 48-72 h. The expression plasmids containing full-length cDNA of rat SM22 alpha and a vector expressing SM22 alpha antisense transcripts were constructed, respectively. Coimmunoprecipitation, cosedimentation assay and immunofluorescence analyses were used to detect the interaction of SM22 alpha with F-actin.\n\nThe results revealed that SM22 alpha directly interacted and colocalized with F-actin and thus participated in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in differentiated VSMCs. SM22 alpha facilitated the assembly of actin filaments into bundles. The blockade of SM22 alpha expression by SM22 alpha antisense RNA led to the thinning and dispersion of actin filaments. Consequently, the ratio of F-actin to globular (G)-actin was reduced, and the cell contractility was lost.",

Within this group, its main etiology is adenotonsillar hyperplasia, being adenoidectomy or adenotonsillectomy the best treatment option for quality of life improvement.\n\nTo asses quality of life of children with OSD after adenoidectomy/adenotonsillectomy.\n\nA prospective study was carried out with 48 children, between 2 and 11 years, with clinical manifestations of OSD and obstructive adenotonsillar hyperplasia. The OSA18 questionnaire was answered by the parents to evaluate their children\"s quality of life before surgery; at about thirty days and at least eleven months after the procedure. A higher score meant a worse quality of life.\n\nBefore surgery, the average OSA18 score was 82.83(SD=12.57), with an average global score for quality of life of 6.04(SD=1.66). Within thirty days after surgery, the average OSA18 score was 34.3 (SD=9.95) with an average global score of 9.6(SD=0.81), both showing significant reduction (p< 0.001).

        "Cellular RNA polymerases are highly conserved enzymes that undergo complex conformational changes to coordinate the processing of nucleic acid substrates through the active site. Two domains in particular, the bridge helix and the trigger loop, play a key role in this mechanism by adopting different conformations at various stages of the nucleotide addition cycle. The functional relevance of these structural changes has been difficult to assess from the relatively small number of static crystal structures currently available.\n\nUsing a novel robotic approach we characterized the functional properties of 367 site-directed mutants of the Methanocaldococcus jannaschii RNA polymerase A\" subunit, revealing a wide spectrum of in vitro phenotypes. We show that a surprisingly large number of single amino acid substitutions in the bridge helix, including a kink-inducing proline substitution, increase the specific activity of RNA polymerase. Other \"superactivating\" substitutions are located in the adjacent base helices of the trigger loop.",

        "Drought is a major social and economic problem resulting in huge yield reduction in the field. Today\"s challenge is to develop plants with reduced water requirements and stable yields in fluctuating environmental conditions. Arabidopsis thaliana is an excellent model for identifying potential targets for plant breeding. Drought tolerance in the field was successfully conferred to crops by transferring genes from this model species. While involved in a plant genomics programme, which aims to identify new genes responsible for plant response to abiotic stress, we identified ESKIMO1 as a key gene involved in plant water economy as well as cold acclimation and salt tolerance.\n\nAll esk1 mutants were more tolerant to freezing, after acclimation, than their wild type counterpart. esk1 mutants also showed increased tolerance to mild water deficit for all traits measured. The mutant\"s improved tolerance to reduced water supply may be explained by its lower transpiration rate and better water use efficiency (WUE), which was assessed by carbon isotope discrimination and gas exchange measurements. esk1 alleles were also shown to be more tolerant to salt stress. Transcriptomic analysis of one mutant line and its wild-type background was carried out. Under control watering conditions a number of genes were differentially expressed between the mutant and the wild type whereas under mild drought stress this list of genes was reduced. Among the genes that were differentially expressed between the wild type and mutant, two functional categories related to the response to stress or biotic and abiotic stimulus were over-represented. Under salt stress conditions, all gene functional categories were represented equally in both the mutant and wild type. Based on this transcriptome analysis we hypothesise that in control conditions the esk1 mutant behaves as if it was exposed to drought stress.",

To analyse the worldwide distribution of this polymorphism we analyzed five different populations (586 Vietnamese, 199 Central Africans, 265 Brazilians, 108 Kaingang and 98 Guarani). To investigate a possible association with susceptibility to infectious diseases we determined the polymorphism in malaria patients suffering either mild or severe malaria and in a cohort of hepatitis C virus infected individuals.\n\nWe could detect the indel polymorphism in all populations analysed.

All subjects were given 500 mg calcium supplementation.\n\nFour hundred and forty five healthy, overweight, and obese men and women (age 21-70 years, body mass index (BMI) 28.0-47.0 kg/m(2)). Body weight, fatness, and fat distribution parameters were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and anthropometry, blood samples and 24-h urinary samples were collected.\n\nAt baseline, there were no significant differences between the groups, but there was a significant inverse relation between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and BMI, and a significant positive association between calorie intake and BMI. Three hundred and thirty four subjects completed the study. During the study, there was no significant change in weight, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) or percentage body fat in any of the groups, nor between them. Parathyroid hormone decreased and 25(OH)D increased significantly in both groups receiving cholecalciferol, and serum levels of 25(OH)D stabilized after 3 months. Serum calcium was unchanged in all groups. Urinary calcium excretion increased in all groups, but there was no significant difference between the groups.

        "Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a condition of severe undernutrition associated with altered regional fat distribution in females. Although primarily a disease of females, AN is increasingly being recognized in males and is associated with hypogonadism. Testosterone is a major regulator of body composition in males, and testosterone administration in adults decreases visceral fat. However, the effect of low testosterone and other hormonal alterations on body composition in boys with AN is not known.\n\nWe hypothesized that testosterone deficiency in boys with AN is associated with higher trunk fat, as opposed to extremity fat, compared with control subjects.\n\nWe assessed body composition using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and measured fasting testosterone, estradiol, insulin- like growth factor-1, leptin, and active ghrelin concentrations in 15 boys with AN and in 15 control subjects of comparable maturity aged 12-19 y.\n\nFat and lean mass in AN boys was 69% and 86% of that in control subjects. Percentage extremity fat and extremity lean mass were lower in boys with AN (P = 0.003 and 0.0008); however, percentage trunk fat and the trunk to extremity fat ratio were higher after weight was adjusted for (P = 0.005 and 0.003). Testosterone concentrations were lower in boys with AN, and, on regression modeling, positively predicted percentage extremity lean mass and inversely predicted percentage trunk fat and trunk to extremity fat ratio. Other independent predictors of regional body composition were bone age and weight.",
        "Spina bifida occulta (SBO) is a common developmental variant. The aim of this study was to re-examine the possible association between SBO and constipation in children.\n\nA total of 113 children with constipation underwent plain abdominal radiography, anorectal manometry, neurophysiologic study, electromyography testing, and colonic transit study. Eighty-six were diagnosed with functional constipation (FC) and 27 were diagnosed with nonretentive fecal incontinence (NRFI). The incidence of SBO in these children was compared with 226 sex- and age-matched controls. Twenty-four SBO children with either FC or NRFI also underwent individualized biofeedback training and electric stimulation therapy based on the investigation results.\n\nThe incidence of SBO in the FC and NRFI groups was 47.7% and 77.8%, respectively. Statistically, this is significantly higher than that of the control group (chi-square, 23.9%; P < .05). Compared with the FC or NRFI children without SBO, the FC and NRFI children with SBO had decreased vector volumes and electromyography amplitudes, increased rectal sensory thresholds, and prolonged latency of pudendo-anal reflex. All 24 children who underwent individualized biofeedback training and electrical stimulation treatment had sustained symptomatic improvement with less straining, fewer incomplete bowel movements, and less abdominal pain. The recovery rate was 79.2% (19 of 24).",
        "Phogrin and IA-2, autoantigens in insulin-dependent diabetes, have been shown to be involved in insulin secretion in pancreatic beta-cells; however, implications at a molecular level are confusing from experiment to experiment. We analyzed biological functions of phogrin in beta-cells by an RNA interference technique.\n\nAdenovirus-mediated expression of short hairpin RNA specific for phogrin (shPhogrin) was conducted using cultured beta-cell lines and mouse islets. Both glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and cell proliferation rate were determined in the phogrin-knockdown cells. Furthermore, protein expression was profiled in these cells. To see the binding partner of phogrin in beta-cells, coimmunoprecipitation analysis was carried out.\n\nAdenoviral expression of shPhogrin efficiently decreased its endogenous expression in pancreatic beta-cells. Silencing of phogrin in beta-cells abrogated the glucose-mediated mitogenic effect, which was accompanied by a reduction in the level of insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2) protein, without any changes in insulin secretion. Phogrin formed a complex with insulin receptor at the plasma membrane, and their interaction was promoted by high-glucose stimulation that in turn led to stabilization of IRS2 protein. Corroboratively, phogrin knockdown had no additional effect on the proliferation of beta-cell line derived from the insulin receptor-knockout mouse.",
        "Skeletal muscle insulin resistance is associated with lipid accumulation, but whether insulin resistance is due to reduced or enhanced flux of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria is both controversial and unclear. We hypothesized that skeletal muscle-specific overexpression of the muscle isoform of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), the enzyme that controls the entry of long-chain fatty acyl CoA into mitochondria, would enhance rates of fatty acid oxidation and improve insulin action in muscle in high-fat diet insulin-resistant rats.\n\nRats were fed a standard (chow) or high-fat diet for 4 weeks. After 3 weeks, in vivo electrotransfer was used to overexpress the muscle isoform of CPT1 in the distal hindlimb muscles (tibialis anterior and extensor digitorum longus [EDL]). Skeletal muscle insulin action was examined in vivo during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp.\n\nIn vivo electrotransfer produced a physiologically relevant increase of approximately 20% in enzyme activity; and although the high-fat diet produced insulin resistance in the sham-treated muscle, insulin action was improved in the CPT1-overexpressing muscle. This improvement was associated with a reduction in triacylglycerol content, the membrane-to-cytosolic ratio of diacylglycerol, and protein kinase C theta activity. Importantly, overexpression of CPT1 did not affect markers of mitochondrial capacity or function, nor did it alter skeletal muscle acylcarnitine profiles irrespective of diet.",
        "This study aims to analyze the embolic activity in patients with calcified aortic stenosis who underwent aortic valve replacement using intra-aortic filtration with an EMBOL-X System device (Edwards Lifesciences Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA).\n\nFrom January 2007 to July 2007, 13 consecutive patients with calcified aortic stenosis, who underwent isolated aortic valve replacement using intra-aortic filtration by an EMBOL-X System for 5 minutes after aortic clamp release, were evaluated. Mean patient age was 63.7 years (range 34 to 79 years) and 61.5% were female. The mean bypass time was 60.2 +/- 7.5 minutes (range 45 to 72 minutes) and the mean cross-clamp time was 50 +/- 7.5 minutes (range 35 to 63 minutes). Following removal, each filter was fixed in formalin and analyzed macroscopically with the captured fragments being counted. Histological examinations of the captured material were performed.\n\nThere were no strokes or gross neurological events. There were no cases of postoperative renal failure. No deaths were reported during hospitalization. Particulate emboli were found in five (38.5%) of the filters. On histological analysis of the particulate emboli captured, two (40%) contained fibrin, two (40%) presented conjunctive tissue, one (20%) contained red blood cells and in one it was not possible to determine the nature of the particulates captured.",
        "Diagonal earlobe crease (ELC) have been proposed as a marker of generalized atherosclerosis, so in the present study it was investigated whether individuals with ELC have a shortened telomere, which correlates with an accelerated cell turnover and premature aging, leading to atherosclerosis.\n\nThe mean terminal restriction fragment (TRF) was determined by Southern blot hybridization in the peripheral blood cells of 34 male Japanese patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS) who were under 70 years of age with (n=17) and without (n=17) bilateral ELC, and assessed the relationship of ELC to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (AVD). The results showed that the TRF was shorter in the MetS patients with ELC in comparison to age- and risk-factor-matched MetS patients without ELC (7.6+/-1.1 kbp vs 8.6+/-1.2 kbp; P<0.05). ELC were present in 13 patients in the AVD group (n=18), but only 4 patients in the non-AVD group (n=16) had ELC (72.2% and 25% respectively; P<0.05).",
        "To evaluate the patterns of distant relapse, focusing on brain metastasis, in patients with stage III nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with radical chemoradiation therapy (CRT).\n\nThe British Columbia Cancer Agency provincial database identified 2268 patients presenting with stage III NSCLC between January 1, 1990 and December 31, 2000. Of these, 120 patients received radical CRT, forming the study cohort. Variables analyzed included gender, age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, stage, histology, sites of metastasis, and survival. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.\n\nThe study cohort comprised 59 men and 61 women, median age 54.5 years. There were 74 stage IIIA and 46 stage IIIB cases. Histologic subtypes were squamous cell carcinoma (n = 29), adenocarcinoma (n = 53), and other non-squamous histologies (n = 38). Median follow-up time was 17.7 months. Median overall survival time was 19.2 months. Thirty-two patients (27%) developed brain metastasis. Non-brain metastases occurred in 51 patients (42%). No variables were statistically significantly associated with the risk of developing brain metastasis. Trends for higher risks of brain metastasis were observed with younger age (P = 0.09), and poor performance status (P = 0.07). Brain metastasis risk was highest during the first 10 months, progressively declining thereafter.",
        "To test the hypothesis that individuals with regional and widespread pain disorders have an increased risk of mortality.\n\nWe conducted a prospective cohort study of 4515 adults. Subjects were an age- and sex-stratified sample who had participated in a population study of pain occurrence during 1996. Based on those reports subjects were classified as having no pain, regional pain or widespread pain. All subjects were identified on the National Health Service Central Register and followed up until April 2005, a total of 8.2 yrs, at which time information was obtained on vital status, and if applicable, date and cause of death. The relationship between pain status and subsequent death is expressed as mortality rate ratios with 95% CIs, adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity and practice.\n\nA total of 35.2% reported regional pain and 16.9% satisfied criteria for widespread pain. In comparison with those without pain, there was a 20% and 30% increased risk of dying over the follow-up period among subjects with regional and widespread pain, respectively. The specific causes of death in excess were cancer and cardiovascular disease. In addition, the mortality risk from both cancer and cardiovascular deaths was found to increase as the number of pain sites that subjects reported increased.",
        "In SSc, diagnosis and classification is based mainly on skin sclerosis. Herein, we investigated in a large multicentre cohort, to what extent skin sclerosis reflects organ involvement and additional clinical symptoms.\n\nA total of 1200 SSc patients from the register of the German Systemic Sclerosis Network (DNSS), classified as either lcSSc or dcSSc, were analysed for their serological characteristics, clinical symptoms and organ manifestations in relation to skin involvement measured by the modified Rodnan skin score (mRSS).\n\nSSc patients with different mRSS did not differ significantly in their disease duration and in most of the clinical symptoms. They showed a similar distribution of most organ manifestations such as pulmonary arterial hypertension as well as cardiac, renal and nervous system involvement. More severe skin thickening was found to be associated with pulmonary fibrosis and gastrointestinal symptoms, as well as with digital ulcers and musculoskeletal involvement.",
        "To investigate the association of mannose-binding lectin (MBL)-low genotypes with the clinical and immunological expression of primary SS.\n\nEighty-one patients with primary SS who fulfilled the 2002 classification criteria were included in the study. MBL2 polymorphisms were investigated by sequence-based DNA typing of the promoter and exon 1. Genotypes 0/0, 0/XA or XA/XA were considered as MBL-low and XA/A, A/0 and A/A as MBL-sufficient. Control groups included 46 patients who exclusively fulfilled the 1993 SS criteria, 114 SLE patients and 104 healthy individuals.\n\nTwelve (15%) SS patients had MBL-low genotypes, of whom six (7%) had genotype 0/XA, five (6%) had genotype 0/0 and one (1%) had genotype XA/XA. A higher prevalence of the XA/A genotype (32 vs 17%, P = 0.01) was found in primary SS patients in comparison with SLE patients. No patient with primary SS carrying MBL-low genotypes had purpura, glomerulonephritis or neurological involvement (0 vs 29%, P = 0.025). Immunologically, patients carrying MBL-low genotypes had a lower frequency of anti-Ro/SS-A antibodies (17 vs 55%, P = 0.014), anti-La/SS-B antibodies (8 vs 48%, P = 0.009) and low C4/C3 levels (0 vs 32%, P = 0.016). No patient with primary SS carrying the homozygous MBL-deficient genotype 0/0 had anti-Ro/SS-A or anti-La/SS-B antibodies, low C3/C4 levels or circulating cryoglobulins.",
        "MMP is a key enzyme in the degradation of extracellular matrices, and its expression plays important roles in inflammatory diseases. Cordycepin (3\"-deoxyadenosine), a bioactive compound of Cordyceps militaris, has been shown to exhibit many pharmacological activities, such as anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory and anti-infection activities. In this study, we aimed at the inhibitory effect of cordycepin on IL-1beta-induced MMP-1 and MMP-3 expression as well as the molecular basis using RA synovial fibroblasts (RASFs).\n\nRASFs were isolated from synovial tissue obtained from 12 patients with RA and cultured in monolayer. Expression of MMP-1 and MMP-3 was evaluated using western blotting and real-time PCR. Chemokines were analysed by ELISA. The phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase was measured by western blotting. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed to evaluate binding activities of DNA to nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1).\n\nCordycepin inhibited IL-1beta-induced MMP-1 and MMP-3 expressions in RASFs in a dose-dependent manner. Among various chemokines [such as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), GRO-alpha, regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and presumably secreted (RANTES) and epithelial neutrophil activating peptide 78 (ENA-78)], cordycepin specifically blocked IL-1beta-induced ENA-78 production in RASF. Moreover, cordycepin significantly inhibited IL-1beta-induced p38/JNK and AP-1 activation, but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and NF-kappaB activation.",
        "High-throughput sequencing technology is capable to identify novel short RNAs in plant species. We used Solexa sequencing to find new microRNAs in one of the model legume species, barrel medic (Medicago truncatula).\n\n3,948,871 reads were obtained from two separate short RNA libraries generated from total RNA extracted from M. truncatula leaves, representing 1,563,959 distinct sequences. 2,168,937 reads were mapped to the available M. truncatula genome corresponding to 619,175 distinct sequences. 174,504 reads representing 25 conserved miRNA families showed perfect matches to known miRNAs. We also identified 26 novel miRNA candidates that were potentially generated from 32 loci. Nine of these loci produced eight distinct sequences, for which the miRNA* sequences were also sequenced. These sequences were not described in other plant species and accumulation of these eight novel miRNAs was confirmed by Northern blot analysis. Potential target genes were predicted for most conserved and novel miRNAs.",
        "To observe the influence of HCV F protein on apoptosis of HepG2 cells, and explore the association between F protein and NF-kappaB signal pathway.\n\nHCV 1b F gene containing HepG2-F cells and HCV 1b C gene containing HepG2-C cells were treated with 100 IU/mL TNF-alpha, and analyzed by flow cytometry, Western blotting, and dual luciferase reporter assay. Empty plasmid pcDNA3.1(+) containing HepG2-3.1 cells were used as control.\n\n(i) With the treatment of TNF-alpha for 18 h, the apoptosis rates (AR) of HepG2-F and HepG2-3.1 cells were 0.41% (+/- 0.11%) and 37.43% (+/- 2.03%) respectively, while that of HepG2-C was 4.07% (+/- 0.18%). At 36 h after TNF-alpha treatment, the AR of HepG2-F and HepG2-3.1 cells were 10.03% (+/- 0.41%) and 44.63% (+/- 3.37%), and that of HepG2-C was 14.95% (+/- 0.85%). (ii) After the treatment of TNF-alpha for 0.5-18 h, the p65 contents in the whole cells of HepG2-F and HepG2-3.1 showed no significant difference (P = 0.34, t = 1.08), while the p65 contents in the nucleus of HepG2-F and HepG2-3.1 cells were 3.8-1.9 times and 1.8-1.0 times higher than that in the non-treated cells (P = 0.013, t = 4.25). (iii) The relative luciferase unit (RLU) of the HepG2 cells, co-transfected with pcDNA3.1-F and pNF-kappaB-luc, and then treated with TNF-alpha (100 IU/mL) for 18 h, showed a pcDNA3.1-F dose-dependent increase.",
        "Infection with the protozoan parasite Plasmodium is the cause of malaria. Plasmodium infects host erythrocytes causing the pathology of the disease. Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes can modulate the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and alter their capacity to activate T cells.\n\nMice infected with Plasmodium yoelii and isolated P. yoelii-infected erythrocytes were used to study their effect on the maturation of mouse dendritic cells.\n\nDCs are not able to mature in response to LPS injection during the late stage of P. yoelii infection in mice, indicating impaired functionality of these cells in vivo. P. yoelii- infected erythrocytes inhibit the maturation of DCs in vitro in a dose-dependent manner, which is consistent with the inhibition found during late infection when parasite burden is highest. The inhibition of DC maturation and the cytokine secretion profile of DCs are modulated by soluble factors released by P. yoelii-infected erythrocytes. A small, heat-stable, non-hydrophobic molecule of P. yoelii-infected erythrocytes rapidly inhibits the LPS induced phenotypic maturation of DCs in a reversible manner.",
        "To assess the association of lymphovascular invasion (LVI) with cancer recurrence and survival in a large international series of patients treated with radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) for upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC).\n\nData were collected on 1,453 patients treated with RNU at 13 academic centers and combined into a relational database. Pathologic slides were rereviewed by genitourinary pathologists according to strict criteria. LVI was defined as presence of tumor cells within an endothelium-lined space.\n\nLVI was observed in 349 patients (24%). Proportion of LVI increased with advancing tumor stage, high tumor grade, presence of tumor necrosis, sessile tumor architecture, and presence of lymph node metastasis (all P < .001). LVI was an independent predictor of disease recurrence and survival (P < .001 for both). Addition of LVI to the base model (comprising pathologic stage, grade, and lymph node status) marginally improved its predictive accuracy for both disease recurrence and survival (1.1%, P = .03; and 1.7%, P < .001, respectively). In patients with negative lymph nodes and those in whom a lymphadenectomy was not performed (n = 1,313), addition of LVI to the base model improved the predictive accuracy of the base model for both disease recurrence and survival by 3% (P < .001 for both). In contrast, LVI was not associated with disease recurrence or survival in node-positive patients (n = 140).",
        "Serum sodium predicts prognosis in chronic severe hepatitis B and may improve the prognostic accuracy of the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, but the available information is limited. The present study was undertaken to study the clinical use of the serum sodium incorporated MELD (MELD-Na) and assess its validity by the concordance (c)-statistics in predicting the prognosis of the patient with chronic severe hepatitis B.\n\nA total of 426 adult patients with a diagnosis of chronic severe hepatitis B between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2007 at a single center were studied. The scores of serum sodium, MELD, MELD-Na, and DeltaMELD-Na (DeltaMELD-Na = MELD-Na at 14 days after medical treatment -MELD-Na score on admission) of the patients with chronic severe hepatitis B were calculated. The 3-month mortality in the patients was measured, and the validity of the models was determined by means of the concordance (c) statistics.\n\nThe average MELD, MELD-Na scores of survival group were 25.70 +/- 5.08 and 26.60 +/- 6.90, and those of dead group were 35.60 +/- 6.78 and 42.80 +/- 9.57 on admission. There was a significant difference in MELD and MELD-Na between the survival and dead groups (P < 0.01). The average DeltaMELD-Na score of the survival group was -0.97 +/- 3.51, and that of the dead group was 3.45 +/- 2.38 at 2 weeks after the treatment. There was a significant difference in DeltaMELD-Na between the survival and dead groups (P < 0.01). The areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves of Na, MELD and MELD-Na for the occurrence of death in 3 months were 0.742, 0.875 and 0.922. The 3-month mortality of the MELD-Na scores group < 25, 25-30, 31-34, 35-40 and > 40 were 2.0%, 5.4%, 35.4%, 53.8 % and 86.9%, respectively. There was a significant difference in the 3-month mortality between the five groups (P < 0.05). The 3-month mortality of the DeltaMELD-Na > 0 group was 65.9%, and that of the DeltaMELD-Na = 0 group was 15.8%; there was a significant difference in the 3-month mortality between the two groups (P < 0.05).",
        "To determine whether the mechanical stretching renders modulation of the peptidyl arginine deiminase 2 (PAD2) expression in cultured astrocytes.\n\nIsolated rat brain astrocytes were subjected to mechanical stretching using a glass bead set-up and polyethylene set-up with or without immobilization. Activity assays and ELISA were performed to detect PAD2 expression. Protein deimination levels in the cells were measured using an anti-citrulline ELISA. PAD2 expression in cells subjected to mechanical stretching was compared with controls. Astrocytes were also subjected to pressure treatment and compared to control cells for PAD2 expression and deimination levels.\n\nAstrocytes subjected to mechanical stretching with or without immobilization showed elevated PAD2 expression. Pressure treatment of astrocytes (25-100 mmHg) also resulted in elevated PAD2 expression and deimination.",
        "The objective of this study was to characterize the effects of the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonist, montelukast (0.1-2 micromol x L(-1)), on Ca(2+)-dependent pro-inflammatory activities, cytosolic Ca(2+) fluxes and intracellular cAMP in isolated human neutrophils activated with the chemoattractants, N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (1 micromol x L(-1)) and platelet-activating factor (200 nmol x L(-1)).\n\nGeneration of reactive oxygen species was measured by lucigenin- and luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence, elastase release by a colourimetric assay, leukotriene B(4) and cAMP by competitive binding ELISA procedures, and Ca(2+) fluxes by fura-2/AM-based spectrofluorimetric and radiometric ((45)Ca(2+)) procedures.\n\nPre-incubation of neutrophils with montelukast resulted in dose-related inhibition of the generation of reactive oxygen species and leukotriene B(4) by chemoattractant-activated neutrophils, as well as release of elastase, all of which were maximal at 2 micromol x L(-1) (mean percentages of the control values of 30 +/- 1, 12 +/- 3 and 21 +/- 3 respectively; P < 0.05). From a mechanistic perspective, treatment of chemoattractant-activated neutrophils with montelukast resulted in significant reductions in both post-peak cytosolic Ca(2+) concentrations and store-operated Ca(2+) influx. These montelukast-mediated alterations in Ca(2+) handling by the cells were associated with a significant elevation in basal cAMP levels, which resulted from inhibition of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases.",
        "In steady state, hemopoietic progenitors constantly egress from the bone marrow (BM) into the blood and circulate through the peripheral tissues. In allergic diseases, the BM releases increased numbers of CD34(+) progenitor cells that migrate to the site of allergic inflammation, where they differentiate into tissue-dwelling and classic effector cells of allergy, such as mast cells, eosinophils, and basophils.\n\nTo examine whether peripheral blood CD34(+) cells in addition to being progenitors may also directly function as inflammatory effector cells.\n\nHighly purified neonatal or adult blood CD34(+) cells were examined for the expression of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) and IL-33 receptors and for their response to these cytokines as well as to supernatants of primary small airway epithelial cells and nasal explants from rhinosinusitis and control subjects. Sputum of patients with asthma was examined before and after allergen inhalation for the presence of IL-5 and IL-13-containing CD34(+) cells.\n\nCirculating CD34(+) cells expressed receptors for TSLP and IL-33 and responded to these cytokines by rapidly releasing high levels of proinflammatory T(H)2-like cytokines and chemokines. These cells were activated in a TSLP-dependent manner by the supernatant fluids from activated primary human small airway epithelial cells and from nasal explants of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Moreover, activated CD34(+) cells containing IL-5 and IL-13 could be detected in the sputum of individuals with allergic asthma, with numbers increasing in response to specific allergen inhalation challenge.",
        "Studies suggested that exogenous ghrelin administration could prevent early left ventricular remodeling in rats with myocardial infarction. We investigated herein whether ghrelin attenuated left ventricular remodeling induced by hypertension and whether ghrelin\"s effect was mediated through the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma)-dependent pathway.\n\nSpontaneously hypertensive rats (8-week-old males) were randomly divided into three groups with 12 rats in each: ghrelin group (received ghrelin 100 microg/kg subcutaneously (s.c.) twice daily); ghrelin + GW9662 group (received the PPAR-gamma antagonist GW9662 at 2 mg/kg s.c., and then ghrelin as above); saline controls. Normal male Wistar Kyoto rats (n = 12) served as normal controls. Four weeks later, the effects of ghrelin on cardiac remodeling were evaluated by echocardiographic, hemodynamic, and histopathological examination, and gene expression analysis (PPAR-gamma protein and mRNA expression). The serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.\n\nGhrelin prevented ventricular remodeling, increased PPAR-gamma expression in the myocardium, suppressed collagen I and collagen III mRNA expression, and also decreased the serum levels of TNF-alpha, but not CRP. All abovementioned effects of ghrelin were inhibited by GW9662.",
        "Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) may influence epigenetic mechanisms; therefore, they could affect chromosomal stability and gene expression. DNA methylation, an epigenetic mechanism, has been associated with cancer initiation and progression. Greenlandic Inuit have some of the highest reported POP levels worldwide.\n\nOur aim in this study was to evaluate the relationship between plasma POPs concentrations and global DNA methylation (percent 5-methylcytosine) in DNA extracted from blood samples from 70 Greenlandic Inuit. Blood samples were collected under the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program and previously analyzed for a battery of POPs.\n\nWe used pyrosequencing to estimate global DNA methylation via Alu and LINE-1 assays of bisulfite-treated DNA. We investigated correlations between plasma POP concentrations and global DNA methylation via correlation coefficients and linear regression analyses.\n\nWe found inverse correlations between percents methylcytosine and many of the POP concentrations measured. Linear regressions, adjusting for age and cigarette smoking, showed statistically significant inverse linear relationships mainly for the Alu assay for p,p\"-DDT (1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane; beta = -0.26), p,p\"-DDE [1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl) ethylene; beta = -0.38], beta-hexachlorocyclohexane (beta = -0.48), oxychlordane (beta = -0.32), alpha-chlordane (beta = -0.75), mirex (beta = -0.27), sum of polychlorinated biphenyls (beta = -0.56), and sum of all POPs (beta = -0.48). Linear regressions for the LINE-1 assay showed beta estimates of similar magnitudes to those using the Alu assay, however, none was statistically significant.",
        "Many agricultural contaminants disrupt endocrine systems of wildlife. However, evidence of endocrine disruption in wild amphibians living in agricultural areas has been controversial. Typically, studies on the effects of pollutants on wildlife attempt to compare polluted with unpolluted sites.\n\nWe took a novel approach to address this question by explicitly quantifying the relationship between gonadal abnormalities and habitats characterized by differing degrees of agricultural activity.\n\nWe quantified the occurrence of gonadal abnormalities and measures of gonadal function in at least 20 giant toads (Bufo marinus) from each of five sites that occur along a gradient of increasing agricultural land use from 0 to 97%.\n\nThe number of abnormalities and frequency of intersex gonads increased with agriculture in a dose-dependent fashion. These gonadal abnormalities were associated with altered gonadal function. Testosterone, but not 17beta-estradiol, concentrations were altered and secondary sexual traits were either feminized (increased skin mottling) or demasculinized (reduced forearm width and nuptial pad number) in intersex toads. Based on the end points we examined, female morphology and physiology did not differ across sites. However, males from agricultural areas had hormone concentrations and secondary sexual traits that were intermediate between intersex toads and non-agricultural male toads. Skin coloration at the most agricultural site was not sexually dimorphic; males had female coloration.",
        "The prevalence of restless legs syndrome (RLS) among the general population is 2-15%, and with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) 2%. Both RLS and FMS are more common among women. The aim of our study was to evaluate the prevalence of RLS in a group of female patients diagnosed with FMS and to compare the occurrence of symptoms of daytime sleepiness and experienced sleep disorders between fibromyalgia patients with or without RLS.\n\nThree hundred and thirty-two female patients, 20-60 years old, diagnosed with FMS at Skonviks Rehab between 2002 and 2006, answered a questionnaire mailed to their home address. The questionnaire consisted of the international RLS study group criteria as well as of questions concerning symptoms of insomnia and daytime sleepiness measured according to the Epworth Sleepiness Scale.\n\nNearly 64% of the women were also suffering from RLS. More patients suffering from both RLS and FMS were affected by problems of initiating and maintaining sleep than those suffering from FMS only. More patients suffering from both RLS and FMS did not feel refreshed on awakening compared with those suffering from FMS without RLS. The patients with concomitant RLS and FMS were more often hypersomnolent than those suffering from FMS only.",
        "Evidence regarding the association between alcohol consumption and the gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) spectrum has been conflicting. We examined the association between alcohol consumption and erosive esophagitis and Barrett\"s epithelium in Japanese men.\n\nThe study population comprised 463 men subjects who had undergone an upper endoscopy at the Gastroenterology Division of Yokohama City University Hospital between August 2005 and July 2006. The presence of erosive esophagitis and Barrett\"s epithelium was diagnosed based on the Los Angeles Classification and the Prague C and M Criteria, respectively. We divided the study population into four groups: never drinkers, light drinkers (less than 25.0 g of ethanol per day), moderate drinkers (25.0 to 50.0 g of ethanol per day), and heavy drinkers (more than 50.0 g of ethanol per day). A linear regression of the logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the dose-response trends.\n\nCompared with never drinkers, light drinkers (less than 25.0 g ethanol per day), moderate drinkers (25.0 to 50.0 g per day), and heavy drinkers (more than 50.0 g per day) had ORs for erosive esophagitis of 1.110 (95% CI: 0.553 - 2.228, p = 0.7688), 1.880 (95% CI: 1.015 - 3.484, p = 0.0445) and 1.988 (95% CI: 1.120 - 3.534, p = 0.0190), respectively. These groups had ORs for Barrett\"s epithelium of 1.278 (95% CI: 0.752 - 2.170, p = 0.3643), 1.458 (95% CI: 0.873 - 2.433, p = 0.1500), and 1.912 (95% CI: 1.185 - 3.086, p = 0.0079), respectively. The odds ratios/grams (alcohol)/day of dose response trends for erosive esophagitis and Barrett\"s epithelium were 1.015 (95% CI: 1.004-1.026, p = 0.0066) and 1.012 (95% CI: 1.003-1.021, p = 0.0079), respectively.",
        "There is evidence supporting that tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-signaling can induce production of beta-amyloid (A\u03b2) in the brain. Moreover, amyloid-induced toxicity has been shown to be dependent on TNFR-signaling. However, it is still unclear whether TNFRs are involved in the early stages of dementia.\n\nWe analyzed soluble TNFR1 and TNFR2 levels in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at baseline in 137 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 30 age-matched controls. The MCI patients were followed for 4-6 years with an incidence of Alzheimer\"s disease (AD) or vascular dementia (VaD) of 15% per year.\n\nThe patients with MCI who subsequently developed these forms of dementias had higher levels of sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 in both CSF and plasma already at baseline when compared to age-matched controls (p<0.05). In the CSF of MCI subjects and controls the levels of both sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 correlated strongly with \u03b2-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) activity (r(s)=0.53-0.68, p<0.01) and A\u03b2 40 levels (r(s)=0.59-0.71, p<0.001). Similarly, both sTNFRs were associated with A\u03b2 40 (r(s)=0.39-0.46, p<0.05) in plasma. Finally, the levels of both sTNFRs correlated with the axonal damage marker tau in the CSF of MCI subjects and controls (r(s)=0.57-0.83, p<0.001).",
        "Resident-led teaching on surgical services is typically disorganized, and the primary responsibility is often unassigned. Creation of a specified role of \"teaching resident\" (TR) is hypothesized to encourage residents to teach more, develop leadership skills, and enhance medical student clerkship experiences.\n\nAll residents in general surgery training at the University of California, San Francisco, were surveyed to determine perceptions of teaching responsibility. Independently, second-year residents were solicited for voluntary participation in a TR program that gave them primary responsibility for teaching medical students assigned to their services during a 1-month rotation. After completion of the TR rotation, these residents evaluated the TR experience with their prior rotation at the same hospital (which had the same service structure but no TR duties). Medical student clerkship evaluations were reviewed to compare experiences between the 2 periods as well.\n\nOverall response rate for the general survey administered to all residents was 93% (67/72). All 6 second-year residents rotating through the designated services over a 6-month period volunteered to participate, but 2 did not have assigned medical students. Evaluations of the TR program were thus completed by 100% (4/4) residents. Time spent teaching medical students increased significantly, from 0.625 hours/week pre-TR to 2.75 hours/week during TR (p = 0.0026). All felt that teaching skills and motivation to teach increased, and 75% also reported improvement in leadership skills. Medical student scores on a 5-point scale revealed an increase in clinical instruction from 2.17 pre-TR to 3.25 (p = 0.0054). Satisfaction of clerkship objectives also increased from 3.17 pre-TR to 3.75 (p = 0.038).",
        "Some patients with plaque-type psoriasis respond slowly to treatment with etanercept. In such cases combining etanercept with conventional treatments might be helpful.\n\nTo investigate whether treatment with 311-nm ultraviolet (UV) B can improve the therapeutic response in patients treated with etanercept.\n\nFour women and one man (mean age 57 years, range 48-66) with moderate to severe plaque-type psoriasis who had received standard treatment with etanercept 50 mg twice weekly for 6 weeks without Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) reduction of 75% or greater (of initial mean PASI of 16.0, range 15.4-20.4) were enrolled in the study. Starting at 6 weeks, 311-nm UVB treatment was given to a randomly selected body half (left or right, excluding the head) for another 6 weeks, while all patients continued receiving etanercept. The patients were monitored by half-body PASI at weekly intervals.\n\nDuring the 6-week irradiation regimen, 311-nm UVB significantly bolstered the therapeutic response in the patients on etanercept treatment. After 6 weeks of 311-nm UVB, the patients had a mean PASI on their UV-irradiated body halves of 1.6 (range 0.6-3.3) vs. 4.7 (range 1.4-8.6) on nonirradiated body halves (P = 0.0192, paired two-tailed t-test), compared with 10.7 (range 6-16.4) and 10.5 (range 5.2-16.4) at start of 311-nm UVB treatment. The overall mean PASI reduction from baseline (i.e. at etanercept start) was 89% vs. 68%, respectively (P = 0.0009 and P = 0.0088).",
        "Combining statins with antihypertensive therapy has been demonstrated to provide an early reduction in cardiovascular events. This nested substudy of the AVALON trial assessed the effects of coadministered amlodipine and atorvastatin vs. either therapy alone or placebo on arterial compliance, to evaluate the vascular benefits of coadministered therapy.\n\nDuring an initial 8-week, double-blind phase, patients with concomitant hypertension and dyslipidemia were randomized into four treatment groups (placebo, amlodipine 5 mg, atorvastatin 10 mg, or coadministered amlodipine 5 mg and atorvastatin 10 mg). The sustained effect of combined therapy was evaluated during subsequent 8-week, single-blind, and 12-week, open-label periods. In the single-blind phase, all patients were coadministered amlodipine 5 mg and atorvastatin 10 mg, which were then titrated to optimize blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol control during the open-label phase. Arterial compliance was assessed every 4 weeks using the HDI/Pulsewave CR-2000.\n\nOverall, 668 patients (61% male, mean age 55 years) were randomized to treatment. A 19% improvement in small artery compliance (C2) was observed with coadministered amlodipine and atorvastatin from baseline to week 8, which was significantly greater than with either treatment alone or with placebo (P = 0.03 to 0.0001). After 28 weeks, C2 was increased from baseline in all groups, but the overall improvement was greatest in the group receiving coadministered drugs for the entire study period (P < 0.05).",
        "Preeclampsia is a serious complication in pregnancy with an increased future cardiovascular and metabolic risk for both mother and newborn. Recently, angiopoietin-related growth factor (AGF) was introduced as a novel liver-derived protein with proangiogenic and insulin-sensitizing effects. In the current study, we hypothesized that serum levels of AGF would be lower in preeclamptic patients as compared to healthy controls.\n\nAGF was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in control and preeclamptic patients during pregnancy (\n\nn =22, Preeclampsia: n =22) and 6 months after delivery (\n\nn =20, Preeclampsia: n =20). Furthermore, circulating AGF was correlated to clinical and biochemical measures of renal function, glucose, and lipid metabolism, as well as inflammation.\n\nDuring pregnancy, median maternal AGF concentrations were significantly higher in preeclampsia (191.6 microg/l) as compared to control subjects (136.3 microg/l) (P = 0.004). Furthermore, preeclampsia and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were associated with AGF levels in multivariate analyses independent of maternal age. However, higher circulating AGF concentrations in preeclampsia did not persist 6 months after delivery.",
        "Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA) autoantibodies recognize epitopes predominantly within the N-terminal noncollagenous (NC)-1 domain of type VII collagen. Recently, some EBA cases with reactivity to other domains, i.e. the triple-helical (T-H) collagenous domain and the NC-2 domain, have been reported.\n\nTo investigate the ultrastructural localization of epitopes for sera from five patients with EBA that were unreactive by immunoblotting with the NC-1, NC-2 and collagenous domains of type VII collagen.\n\nImmunogold postembedding indirect immunoelectron microscopy was performed using normal human skin and type VII collagen-deficient skin as substrates.\n\nPostembedding indirect immunoelectron microscopy revealed that the five EBA sera showed immunoreactivity in the dermis, mainly located 0-400 nm below the lamina densa. IgG labelling was not observed in type VII collagen-deficient skin from a patient with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. The distribution histogram found in this study was different from those of sera that reacted with the NC-1 and/or NC-2 domains, and was similar to those of sera reacting with the T-H collagenous domain.",
        "Blockade of the CD40-CD154 costimulatory pathway can prolong allograft survival, but does not prevent the development of transplant arteriosclerosis in several models. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of CD40-CD154-independent transplant arteriosclerosis in major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-class I-mismatched aortic allografts.\n\nMHC class I-mismatched CBK (H2k+Kb) donor aortas were transplanted into CBA (H2k) recipients who can only recognize the graft through CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells responding to the class I MHC mismatch through the indirect pathway of allorecognition. Recipients were treated with anti-CD154 antibody (MR1) alone or in combination with anti-CD8 (YTS169) or anti-interleukin (IL)-4 (11B11) antibodies. Grafts were analyzed by histology on days 30 and 60 and for intragraft mRNA expression on day 14 after transplantation.\n\nRepeated treatment with anti-CD154 alone or in combination with anti-CD8 antibody did not prevent intimal proliferation compared with untreated controls (65%+/-6%, 62%+/-9%, and 71%+/-7% luminal occlusion, respectively, 60 days after transplantation). In both treatment groups, the expression of IL-4, IL-5, and eotaxin was increased compared with control grafts, and an eosinophilic infiltration was observed. Neutralizing IL-4 in combination with CD40-CD154 blockade and CD8+ T-cell depletion abrogated transplant arteriosclerosis (9%+/-4% luminal occlusion 60 days after transplantation).",
        "Understanding the molecular control of cell lineages and fate determination in complex tissues is key to not only understanding the developmental biology and cellular homeostasis of such tissues but also for our understanding and interpretation of the molecular pathology of diseases such as cancer. The prerequisite for such an understanding is detailed knowledge of the cell types that make up such tissues, including their comprehensive molecular characterisation. In the mammary epithelium, the bulk of the tissue is composed of three cell lineages, namely the basal/myoepithelial, luminal epithelial estrogen receptor positive and luminal epithelial estrogen receptor negative cells. However, a detailed molecular characterisation of the transcriptomic differences between these three populations has not been carried out.\n\nA whole transcriptome analysis of basal/myoepithelial cells, luminal estrogen receptor negative cells and luminal estrogen receptor positive cells isolated from the virgin mouse mammary epithelium identified 861, 326 and 488 genes as highly differentially expressed in the three cell types, respectively. Network analysis of the transcriptomic data identified a subpopulation of luminal estrogen receptor negative cells with a novel potential role as non-professional immune cells. Analysis of the data for potential paracrine interacting factors showed that the basal/myoepithelial cells, remarkably, expressed over twice as many ligands and cell surface receptors as the other two populations combined. A number of transcriptional regulators were also identified that were differentially expressed between the cell lineages. One of these, Sox6, was specifically expressed in luminal estrogen receptor negative cells and functional assays confirmed that it maintained mammary epithelial cells in a differentiated luminal cell lineage.",
        "Recent studies have demonstrated that cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) reduces sleep apnea in heart failure (HF); however, the mechanism of benefit remains unclear.\n\nOvernight polysomnography (PSG) was performed in consecutive HF patients who were scheduled for CRT implant. Patients with sleep apnea defined by an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of >10/hour were recruited and underwent echocardiogram examination at baseline and 3 months after CRT.\n\nAmong 37 HF patients screened, 20 patients (54%) had sleep apnea and 15 of them consented for the study. After 3 months of CRT, there was a significant improvement in New York Heart Association functional class (3.1+/-0.1 vs 2.1+/-0.1, P<0.01), quality-of-life (QoL) score (62.9+/-3.3 vs 56.1+/-4.5, P=0.02), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF, 28.8+/-2.5% vs 38.1+/-2.3%, P<0.01), and reduction in pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP, 41.0+/-2.7 vs 28.6+/-2.2 mmHg; P<0.01) compared with baseline. Repeated PSG after CRT demonstrated a reduction in the duration of arterial oxygen desaturation<or=95% (251.2+/-36.7 vs 141.0+/-37.1 minutes), AHI (27.5+/-4.7 vs 18.1+/-3.0, P=0.05), and number of central sleep apnea (CSA) (7.8+/-2.6 vs 3.0+/-1.3/hour, P=0.03), but not number of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA, 8.6+/-3.3 vs 7.2+/-2.3/hour, P=0.65) compared to baseline.

        "BACKGROUND\" Human thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is expressed in the human asthmatic lung and activates dendritic cells (DCs) to strongly induce proallergic T-helper type 2 (Th2) cell responses, suggesting that TSLP plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of human asthma. Th2 cells are predominantly involved in mild asthma, whereas a mixture of Th1 and Th2 cells with neutrophilic inflammation, probably induced by Th17, affects more severe asthmatic disease. Exacerbation of asthmatic inflammation is often triggered by airway-targeting RNA viral infection; virus-derived double-stranded RNA, Toll-like receptor (TLR)3 ligand, activates bronchial epithelial cells to produce pro-inflammatory mediators, including TSLP.\n\nBecause TSLPR-expressing DCs express TLR3, we examined how the relationship between TSLP and TLR3 ligand stimulation influences DC activation.\n\nCD11c(+)DCs purified from adult peripheral blood were cultured in TLR ligands containing media with or without TSLP and then co-cultured with allogeneic na\u00efve CD4(+)T cells.\n\nCD11c(+) DCs responded to a combination of TSLP and TLR3 ligand, poly(I : C), to up-regulate expression of the functional TSLP receptor and TLR3. Although TSLP alone did not induce IL-23 production by DCs, poly(I : C) alone primed DCs for the production of IL-23, and a combination of TSLP and poly(I : C) primed DCs for further production of IL-23. The addition of poly(I : C) did not inhibit TSLP-activated DCs to prime na\u00efve CD4(+) T cells to differentiate into inflammatory Th2 cells. Furthermore, DCs activated by a combination of TSLP and poly(I : C) primed more na\u00efve CD4(+) T cells to differentiate into Th17-cytokine-producing cells with a central memory T cell phenotype compared with DCs activated by poly(I : C) alone.",

However, compared with healthy subjects, patients with BAFME displayed elevated choline/creatine ratio in the cerebellar cortex (p = 0.01), whereas there was no significant difference for the other ratios. No (1)H-MRS values in the frontal and occipital cortex differed significantly in the patients compared with the healthy controls. No correlation was detected between (1)H-MRS values and disease duration (p = -0.35) as well as myoclonus severity (p = -0.48).",
        "Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is the second most common leukemia with approximately 13,410 new cases and 8,990 deaths annually in the United States. A novel fusion toxin treatment, diphtheria toxin GM-CSF (DT-GMCSF) has been shown to selectively eliminate leukemic repopulating cells that are critical for the formation of AML. We previously showed that DT-GMCSF treatment of U937 cells, an AML cell line, causes activation of caspases and the induction of apoptosis.\n\nIn this study we further investigate the mechanisms of cell death induced by DT-GMCSF and show that, in addition to the activation of caspase-dependent apoptosis, DT-GMCSF also kills AML cells by simultaneously activating caspase-independent necroptosis. These mechanisms depend on the ability of the targeted toxin to inhibit protein synthesis, and are not affected by the receptor that is targeted or the mechanism through which protein synthesis is blocked.",
        "Mutations in STOX1 were proposed to be causal for predisposing to preeclampsia, a hypertensive disorder originating from placental defects, affecting up to 10% of human pregnancies. However, after the first study published in 2005 three other groups have dismissed the polymorphism described in the first paper as a causal mutation.\n\nIn the present study, we have produced a choriocarcinoma cell line overexpressing STOX1. This overexpression results in transcriptional modification of 12.5% of the genes, some of them being direct targets as shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation. STOX1 overexpression correlates strongly and specifically with transcriptomic alterations in preeclamptic placentas (r = 0.30, p = 9.10(-7)). Numerous known key modulators of preeclampsia (such as Endoglin, Syncytin, human chorionic gonadotrophin -hCG-, and Glial Cell Missing Homolog -GCM1-) were modified in these transformed choriocarcinoma cells.",
        "To examine the prevalence of self-reported functional limitations in a breast cancer population, identify whether these reported limitations are attributed to breast cancer versus other coexisting illnesses, and examine how this attribution changes over time from early in treatment to 9 months later.\n\nLongitudinal, observational study.\n\nCommunity dwelling adults in Detroit metropolitan area.\n\n2033 participants (1011 breast cancer patients, 1022 controls) aged 40-84 years.\n\nParticipants were asked about each of 23 possible coexisting illnesses in addition to breast cancer and whether or not each illness, including breast cancer, caused any activity limitation.\n\nOf the 933 cancer patients who completed both baseline and follow-up evaluations, 45% were aged 65 years and older. At baseline, 56% of patients 65 years and older reported functional limitation compared with 50% of patients younger than 65 years (p=0.005). Of those patients who reported limitation at baseline, 59% of older patients and 78% of younger patients attributed their limitation to breast cancer (p<0.001).

        "Recent data have shown a high incidence of the early repolarization pattern confined in inferolateral leads in patients with idiopathic ventricular fibrillation.\n\nThe purpose of the present study was to investigate the prevalence and the prognostic significance of the early repolarization pattern in inferolateral leads in patients with Brugada syndrome.\n\nClinical, genetic, and electrophysiologic data from 290 individuals (223 males, mean age 48.3 +/- 14.2 years) with a spontaneous or drug-induced type 1 electrocardiogram (ECG) pattern of Brugada syndrome and structurally normal hearts were analyzed. Twelve-lead ECGs were evaluated for the presence of early repolarization pattern, which was defined as J-point elevation of at least 0.1 mV from baseline in at least two inferior or lateral leads. Follow-up data were obtained for all subjects.\n\nAn early repolarization pattern manifested as notched or slurred J-point elevation mainly in lateral leads was observed in 35 subjects (12%). The prevalence of the early repolarization pattern was significantly higher in male subjects (P = .004). During a mean follow-up period of 44.9 +/- 27.5 months, 22 subjects (8%) displayed an arrhythmic event including sudden cardiac death. There were no significant differences regarding spontaneous ECG type of Brugada syndrome, symptoms, family history of sudden cardiac death, and positive genetic test between subjects with and without the early repolarization pattern.

        "Endothelin-1 (ET-1) may function as an aldosterone secretagogue and, in turn, aldosterone can upregulate ET-1 expression. Hence, the existence of a feedforward loop involving ETs and aldosterone has been speculated in primary aldosteronism (PA). In the present study, we sought to examine ET-1 secretion from the adrenal glands in patients with PA.\n\nWe determined ET-1 levels in blood samples obtained during adrenal venous sampling of patients affected by PA (n=17). Furthermore, we examined the mRNA expression of the ET system in tissue samples from aldosterone-producing adenomas (APAs, n=9) and control normal adrenals (n=3).\n\nBlood ET-1 levels were determined by RIA. Tissue mRNA expression of the ET system was assayed with Affymetrix microarrays.\n\nET-1 levels did not differ between inferior vena cava and adrenal vein blood in both bilateral adrenal hyperplasia and APA patients. Moreover, cortisol-normalized ET-1 levels did not show lateralized adrenal ET-1 secretion in APAs. Through gene expression profiling with microarray performed in a distinct set of APA individuals (n=9), we confirmed the adrenal expression of a complete ET system, but we did not detect a significant upregulation of ET components within the APA tissue compared with normal adrenals.",
        "In rodent models of chronic renal disease bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7) has been shown to halt disease progression and promote recovery. Subsequent studies utilizing immortalized rodent renal cell lines showed that BMP-7 was renoprotective by antagonizing TGF-beta1-stimulated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The present study sought to determine if BMP-7 prevents TGF-beta1-induced EMT in primary (RPTEC) and immortalized (HK-2) human proximal tubule epithelial cells.\n\nEMT was determined by quantitative real-time PCR analysis of e-cadherin, vimentin, CTGF and TGF-beta1 transcript expression and immunocytochemical analysis of ZO-1 and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) protein expression following TGF-beta1 treatment in RPTEC and HK-2 cells.\n\nIn RPTEC and HK-2 cells, TGF-beta1 significantly reduced e-cadherin expression and significantly increased vimentin, CTGF and TGF-beta1 expression. TGF-beta1 also diminished ZO-1 immunoreactivity and increased alpha-SMA expression in confluent cell monolayers. Co-incubation of TGF-beta1 with an anti-TGF-beta1 neutralizing antibody substantially reduced the cytokine\"s effects, which indicated EMT in these cells was inhibitable. Co-administration of BMP-7 over a broad concentration range (0.01-100 microg/ml) with TGF-beta1 failed to attenuate EMT in RPTEC or HK-2 cells, as demonstrated by no inhibition of altered e-cadherin, vimentin, CTGF and TGF-beta1 expression and no restoration of ZO-1 immunoreactivity. Furthermore, when BMP-7 was applied to proximal tubule cells alone, it also decreased e-cadherin expression and increased vimentin, CTGF and TGF-beta1 expression. Additionally, BMP-7 failed to induce the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) in NRK-49F rat renal fibroblasts. BMP-7 did however prevent TGF-beta1-mediated e-cadherin downregulation in TCMK-1 mouse renal tubular epithelial cells. BMP-7 activity was routinely confirmed by examining BMP-7-induced phosphorylation of SMADs 1/5/8, BMP-7 regulation of BMPR-IA, BMP-7-mediated reduction of IL-6 transcript expression and BMP-7-mediated reduction of secreted IL-6 and IL-8 proteins.",
        "Brain-expressed genes that were created in primate lineage represent obvious candidates to investigate molecular mechanisms that contributed to neural reorganization and emergence of new behavioural functions in Homo sapiens. PMCHL1 arose from retroposition of a pro-melanin-concentrating hormone (PMCH) antisense mRNA on the ancestral human chromosome 5p14 when platyrrhines and catarrhines diverged. Mutations before divergence of hylobatidae led to creation of new exons and finally PMCHL1 duplicated in an ancestor of hominids to generate PMCHL2 at the human chromosome 5q13. A complex pattern of spliced and unspliced PMCHL RNAs were found in human brain and testis.\n\nSeveral novel spliced PMCHL transcripts have been characterized in human testis and fetal brain, identifying an additional exon and novel splice sites. Sequencing of PMCHL genes in several non-human primates allowed to carry out phylogenetic analyses revealing that the initial retroposition event took place within an intron of the brain cadherin (CDH12) gene, soon after platyrrhine/catarrhine divergence, i.e. 30-35 Mya, and was concomitant with the insertion of an AluSg element. Sequence analysis of the spliced PMCHL transcripts identified only short ORFs of less than 300 bp, with low (VMCH-p8 and protein variants) or no evolutionary conservation. Western blot analyses of human and macaque tissues expressing PMCHL RNA failed to reveal any protein corresponding to VMCH-p8 and protein variants encoded by spliced transcripts.",
        "Valproic acid (VPA), a commonly used mood stabilizer that promotes neuronal differentiation, regulates multiple signaling pathways involving extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and glycogen synthase kinase3beta (GSK3beta). However, the mechanism by which VPA promotes differentiation is not understood.\n\nWe report here that 1 mM VPA simultaneously induces differentiation and reduces proliferation of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-treated embryonic day 14 (E14) rat cerebral cortex neural progenitor cells (NPCs). The effects of VPA on the regulation of differentiation and inhibition of proliferation occur via the ERK-p21Cip/WAF1 pathway. These effects, however, are not mediated by the pathway involving the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) but via the pathway which stabilizes Ras through beta-catenin signaling. Stimulation of differentiation and inhibition of proliferation in NPCs by VPA occur independently and the beta-catenin-Ras-ERK-p21Cip/WAF1 pathway is involved in both processes. The independent regulation of differentiation and proliferation in NPCs by VPA was also demonstrated in vivo in the cerebral cortex of developing rat embryos.",
        "PCK rats, an animal model of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD), develop cholangiocyte-derived liver cysts associated with increased intracellular adenosine 3\n\n-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), the inhibition of which suppresses cyst growth. We hypothesized that elevated cAMP stimulates cholangiocyte proliferation via two downstream effectors, exchange proteins activated by cAMP (Epac1 and Epac2 isoforms) and protein kinase A (PKA), and that intracellular calcium is also involved in this process. Assessment of Epac isoforms and PKA regulatory subunits at the messenger RNA and protein level showed that cultured normal rat cholangiocytes express Epac1, Epac2, and all regulatory PKA subunits. Epac isoforms and the PKA RIbeta subunit were overexpressed in cultured PCK cholangiocytes. Proliferation analysis in response to Epac and PKA activation indicated that both normal and PCK cholangiocytes increase their growth upon Epac-specific stimulation, while PKA-specific stimulation results in differential effects, suppressing proliferation in normal cholangiocytes but accelerating this process in PCK cholangiocytes. On the other hand, both PKA and Epac activation of cystic structures generated by normal and PCK cholangiocytes when cultured under three-dimensional conditions resulted in increased cyst growth, particularly in PCK-cholangiocyte derived cysts. Pharmacological inhibitors and small interfering RNA-mediated gene silencing demonstrated the specificity of each effector activation, as well as the involvement of MEK-ERK1/2 signaling in all the observed effector-associated proliferation changes. Hyperproliferation of PCK cholangiocytes in response to PKA stimulation, but not to Epac stimulation, was found to be associated with decreased intracellular calcium, and restoration of calcium levels blocked the PKA-dependent proliferation via the PI3K/AKT pathway.",
        "There have been several descriptions of mouse models that manifest select immunological and clinical features of autoimmune cholangitis with similarities to primary biliary cirrhosis in humans. Some of these models require immunization with complete Freund\"s adjuvant, whereas others suggest that a decreased frequency of T regulatory cells (Tregs) facilitates spontaneous disease. We hypothesized that antimitochondrial antibodies (AMAs) and development of autoimmune cholangitis would be found in mice genetically deficient in components essential for the development and homeostasis of forkhead box 3 (Foxp3)(+) Tregs. Therefore, we examined Scurfy (Sf) mice, animals that have a mutation in the gene encoding the Foxp3 transcription factor that results in a complete abolition of Foxp3(+) Tregs. At 3 to 4 weeks of age, 100% of animals exhibit high-titer serum AMA of all isotypes. Furthermore, mice have moderate to severe lymphocytic infiltrates surrounding portal areas with evidence of biliary duct damage, and dramatic elevation of cytokines in serum and messenger RNAs encoding cytokines in liver tissue, including tumor necrosis factor alpha, interferon-gamma, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-12, and IL-23.",

Leptin-deficient ob/ob mice do not develop liver fibrosis despite the presence of severe long-standing steatohepatitis.

In the chronic TAA fibrosis model, leptin administration was associated with significantly enhanced liver disease and a 100% 5-week to 8-week mortality rate, while administration or coadministration of MLA markedly improved survival, attenuated liver fibrosis, and reduced interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) levels. No significant changes in weight, serum cholesterol, or triglycerides were noted. In vitro administration of rat leptin antagonist (RLA), either alone or with leptin, to rat primary HSCs reduced leptin-stimulated effects such as increased expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA), and activation of alpha1 procollagen promoter.",
        "In perioperative management after hepatectomy, some patients require fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to treat coagulopathy associated with blood loss. However, several studies have suggested a correlation between blood products and pulmonary complications or surgical-site infection (SSI).\n\nThe subjects were 99 patients who underwent hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma without plasma exchange for postoperative liver failure in the Department of Surgery, Jikei University Hospital, between January 2000 and December 2006. We investigated the association of 16 factors including age; gender; preoperative ICG(R15); type of resection; concomitant resection of other digestive organs; duration of operation; blood loss; hepatitis virus status; postoperative minimum platelet count, maximum serum total bilirubin (max T-Bil), minimum serum albumin, or minimum prothrombin time; and the dose of red-blood-cell concentration (RC), FFP, platelet concentration, or albumin given in relation to postoperative pulmonary complications and SSI.\n\nIn univariate analysis, pulmonary complications were correlated with gender (P = 0.012), max T-Bil (P = 0.043), dose of RC given (P = 0.007), dose of FFP given (P < 0.001), and dose of albumin given (P < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, pulmonary complications were correlated with FFP given (P = 0.031) and albumin given (P = 0.020), while the incidence of SSI was not correlated with any factors.",
        "We investigated the effects of a standardized water extract of Labisia pumila var. alata (LPva), and compared to estrogen replacement (ERT), on body weight gain, uterus weight, adipose tissue mRNA and protein levels of adipokines in ovariectomized (OVX) rats.\n\nEight-week-old OVX Sprague-Dawley rats were administered orally with either 10 mg/kg/day (LPva10), 20 mg/kg/day (LPva20) or 50 mg/kg/day (LPva50) of LPva for 30 days. Sham-operated (Sham) and estrogen-treated OVX rats (ERT, 0.625 mg/kg/day) served as controls. Plasma adipokines were measured, and mRNA expressions of the adipokines were determined in the adipose tissues.\n\nERT- and LPva50-treated OVX rats showed significantly less (p<0.05) weight gain compared to untreated OVX rats. Ovariectomy caused plasma leptin levels to decrease significantly (p<0.05), but when treated with LPva or ERT, plasma leptin increased significantly to levels higher or comparable to that seen in the Sham group. The mRNA expression of leptin was higher in the LPva-treated animals than in all other groups. In contrast, the elevated plasma resistin concentrations in OVX rats were significantly reduced in rats given ERT (p<0.05) and LPva extracts (p<0.05). There was no difference in adiponectin levels in all groups. The uterus to body weight ratio of untreated OVX rats was significantly low compared to Sham (p<0.05), but showed dose-dependent increase upon treatment with LPva.",
        "The study was designed to analyze body mass index (BMI) as one of risk factors for snoring in Chinese women.\n\nTotally, 2,938 women (2,423 available for evaluation of menstrual status) aged over 30 years from a population-based epidemiologic study were enrolled.",
        "The main goal of the present study was to evaluate the effect of a commercially available milk containing small amounts of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, oleic acid, and vitamins A, B6, D, E, and folic acid compared with semi-skimmed and skimmed milk in volunteers with moderate cardiovascular risk.\n\nTwo hundred ninety-seven subjects 25 to 65 y of age with moderate cardiovascular risk were randomly allocated into three groups. In addition to their diets, one group consumed 500 mL/d of the enriched milk, another group consumed 500 mL/d of skimmed milk, and a control group consumed 500 mL/d of semi-skimmed milk. All groups consumed the dairy drinks for 1 y and blood samples were taken at 0 and 12 mo.\n\nConsumption of enriched milk for 1 y produced significant (P < 0.05) increases in serum folate (58%) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (4%). Plasma triacylglycerols (10%), total cholesterol (4%), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (6%) were reduced significantly only in the supplemented group. Serum glucose, homocysteine, and C-reactive protein remained unchanged. In the skimmed milk and semi-skimmed milk groups, the only significant decreases were in serum folate (17% and 11%, respectively).",
        "On-demand relaparotomy has been associated with a slightly decreased mortality compared to planned relaparotomy in the surgical treatment of secondary peritonitis. On-demand relaparotomy must be performed without delay to detect progressing sepsis early, before the onset of multiorgan failure. The aim of the study was to evaluate procalcitonin (PCT) as a parameter for early detection of progressing sepsis after operative treatment of the infective source.\n\nIn 104 consecutive patients with secondary peritonitis, PCT serum levels were monitored on postoperative days 1 and 2 after initial operative elimination of the septic focus. The PCT ratio between postoperative days 1 and 2 was calculated and correlated to the success of the initial intervention. The latter was considered inadequate if relaparotomies were necessary to eliminate the intraabdominal infection.\n\nUsing classification and regression tree analysis, a cutoff could be calculated at 1.03 for the PCT ratio of postoperative day 1 to day 2. Lesser values indicated unsuccessful elimination of the septic source, whereas values above 1.03 represented successful operative treatment of the septic focus. Unsuccessful treatment of the septic process could be detected with a specificity of 63% and a sensitivity of 95%.",
        "Hypertension has been related to endothelial dysfunction. Patients with refractory hypertension (RH) have a reduced number of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs).\n\nTo evaluate if blood EPC levels relate to endothelium-dependent vasodilation (ED-VD) in RH.\n\nWe analyzed 29 RH confirmed by 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and assessed complete clinical and laboratory evaluation. EPCs were isolated from peripheral mononuclear cells (MNC) by flow cytometry. ED-VD was determined measuring flow-mediated dilation (FMD) by venous occlusion plethysmography. Results. Circulating EPCs/10(5) MNC (median [Q1-Q3]): 23.0 [4.5-53.8]. FMD (median [Q1-Q3]): 211.7 [79.5-365.8]%. Significant correlations with log-FMD: EPCs (r = 0.469; p = 0.018) and homocysteine (r = -0.414; p = 0.045). There was no collinearity between EPCs and homocysteine. FMD did not correlate with age, gender, office BP, 24-h systolic blood pressure or 24-h diastolic blood pressure, laboratory parameters, C-reactive-protein, left ventricular-mass index, dyslipidaemia, smoking habit and statin or angiotensin system blockers treatment. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that after age-adjustment, EPC (p = 0.027) and homocysteine (p = 0.004) were the only variables that predicted FMD (R = 0.740). After dividing patients according to EPC number, patients in the lower tertile showed a significantly reduced FMD compared with those in the group of the two upper tertiles of EPC: log-FMD (mean+/-SD): 4.7+/-0.9 vs 5.6+/-0.8, respectively (p = 0.031).",
        "Preterm infants endowed with an immature antioxidant defense system are prone to oxidative stress. Hydroxyl radicals are very aggressive reactive oxygen species that lack specific antioxidants. These radicals cannot be measured directly, but oxidation byproducts of DNA or phenylalanine in urine are reliable markers of their activity. Human milk has a higher antioxidant capacity than formula.\n\nWe hypothesized that oxidative stress associated with prematurity could be diminished by feeding human milk.\n\nWe recruited a cohort of stable preterm infants who lacked perinatal conditions associated with oxidative stress; were not receiving prooxidant or antioxidant drugs, vitamins, or minerals before recruitment; and were fed exclusively human milk (HM group) or preterm formula (PTF group). Collected urine was analyzed for oxidative bases of DNA [8-hydroxy-2\"-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG)/2\"-deoxyguanosine (2dG) ratio] and oxidative derivatives of phenylalanine [ortho-tyrosine (o-Tyr)/Phe ratio] by HPLC coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Healthy term newborn infants served as control subjects.\n\nBoth preterm groups eliminated greater amounts of metabolites than did the control group. However, the PTF group eliminated significantly (P < 0.02) higher amounts of 8-oxodG (8-oxodG/2dG ratio: 10.46 +/- 3.26) than did the HM group (8-oxodG/2dG ratio: 9.05 +/- 2.19) and significantly (P < 0.01) higher amounts of o-Tyr (o-Tyr/Phe ratio: 14.90 +/- 3.75) than did the HM group (o-Tyr/Phe ratio: 12.53 +/- 3.49). When data were lumped together independently of the type of feeding received, a significant correlation was established between the 8-oxodG/2dG and o-Tyr/Phe ratios in urine, dependent on gestational age and birth weight.",
        "Acute physical stress causes alteration in gut autonomic function and visceral hypersensitivity in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). We have developed a model to measure this stress response.\n\nTo assess whether treatment with a drug effective in treating IBS (amitriptyline) alters the response to acute stress in IBS patients.\n\nNineteen patients with IBS were given amitriptyline 25-50 mg. Patients underwent physical stress (cold pressor) test at baseline and after 3 months of treatment. Physiological parameters measured were: stress perception; systemic autonomic tone [heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP)]; gut specific autonomic innervation [rectal mucosal blood flow (RMBF)] and visceral sensitivity (rectal electrosensitivity).\n\nFourteen of 19 (74%) patients improved symptomatically after 3 months of amitriptyline. Acute stress induced increased perception of stress and systemic autonomic tone and reduced RMBF in symptomatic responders and nonresponders (P > 0.05 for all). All nonresponders but only 3 of 14 responders continued to exhibit stress-induced reduced pain threshold at 3 months (change from baseline -31% vs. +2%, P < 0.03 respectively).",
        "Mechanical strain and cytokine stimulation are two important mechanisms leading to airway remodeling in asthma. The effect of mechanical strain on cytokine secretion in airway fibroblasts is not known. The aim of this study was to determine whether bronchial and nasal fibroblasts differentially alter cytokine secretion in response to mechanical strain.\n\nWe measured secretion of the pro-fibrotic cytokine, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and the pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-8 and monocyte chemotactic protein 1, before and after mechanical strain in bronchial fibroblasts obtained from asthmatic patients [asthmatic bronchial fibroblasts (BAF)] and normal volunteers [normal bronchial fibroblasts (BNF)], and in nasal fibroblasts (NF) obtained from nasal polyps. Cells were grown on flexible membranes and a mechanical strain of 30% amplitude, 1 Hz frequency was applied for 3, 6 and 24 h. Control cells were unstrained. IL-6, IL-8 and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 was measured after 24 h strain using enzyme-linked immunoassay; mRNA was measured by real time polymerase chain reaction. We also measured mRNA for versican, a matrix proteoglycan, known to be upregulated in the asthmatic airway wall.\n\nIn unstrained conditions, no differences in cytokine secretion were observed. After 24 h strain, BAF secreted more IL-6 than BNF. Mechanical strain increased IL-8 mRNA in BAF, BNF and NF; and IL-6 and versican mRNA, in BAF, only.",
        "Migration is important for the metastatic capacity and thus for the malignancy of cancer cells. There is limited knowledge on regulatory factors that promote the migration of neuroblastoma cells. This study investigates the hypothesis that protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms regulate neuroblastoma cell motility.\n\nPKC isoforms were downregulated with siRNA or modulated with activators and inhibitors. Migration was analyzed with scratch and transwell assays. Protein phosphorylation and expression levels were measured with Western blot.\n\nStimulation with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) induced migration of SK-N-BE(2)C neuroblastoma cells. Treatment with the general protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor GF109203X and the inhibitor of classical isoforms G\u00f66976 inhibited migration while an inhibitor of PKCbeta isoforms did not have an effect. Downregulation of PKCepsilon, but not of PKCalpha or PKCdelta, with siRNA led to a suppression of both basal and TPA-stimulated migration. Experiments using PD98059 and LY294002, inhibitors of the Erk and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways, respectively, showed that PI3K is not necessary for TPA-induced migration. The Erk pathway might be involved in TPA-induced migration but not in migration driven by PKCepsilon. TPA induced phosphorylation of the PKC substrate myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) which was suppressed by the PKC inhibitors. Treatment with siRNA oligonucleotides against different PKC isoforms before stimulation with TPA did not influence the phosphorylation of MARCKS.",
        "By using methylation-sensitive representational difference analysis, we identified protocadherin 10 (PCDH10), a gene that encodes a protocadherin and is silenced in a tumor-specific manner. We analyzed its epigenetic inactivation, biological effects, and prognostic significance in gastric cancer.\n\nMethylation status was evaluated by combined bisulfite restriction analysis and bisulfite sequencing. The effects of PCDH10 re-expression were determined in growth, apoptosis, proliferation, and invasion assays. PCDH10 target genes were identified by complementary DNA microarray analysis.\n\nPCDH10 was silenced or down-regulated in 94% (16 of 17) of gastric cancer cell lines; expression levels were restored by exposure to demethylating agents. Re-expression of PCDH10 in MKN45 gastric cancer cells reduced colony formation in vitro and tumor growth in mice; it also inhibited cell proliferation (P < .01), induced cell apoptosis (P < .001), and repressed cell invasion (P < .05), up-regulating the pro-apoptosis genes Fas, Caspase 8, Jun, and CDKN1A; the antiproliferation gene FGFR; and the anti-invasion gene HTATIP2. PCDH10 methylation was detected in 82% (85 of 104) of gastric tumors compared with 37% (38 of 104) of paired nontumor tissues (P < .0001). In the latter, PCDH10 methylation was higher in precancerous lesions (27 of 45; 60%) than in chronic gastritis samples (11 of 59; 19%) (P < .0001). After a median follow-up period of 16.8 months, multivariate analysis revealed that patients with PCDH10 methylation in adjacent nontumor areas had a significant decrease in overall survival. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that PCDH10 methylation was associated significantly with shortened survival in stage I-III gastric cancer patients.",
        "Current evidence suggests that the mechanisms underlying depth electrode-recorded seizures beginning with hypersynchronous (HYP) onset patterns are functionally distinct from those giving rise to low-voltage fast (LVF) onset seizures. However, both groups have been associated with hippocampal atrophy (HA), indicating a need to clarify the anatomic correlates of each ictal onset type. We used three-dimensional (3D) hippocampal mapping to quantify HA and determine whether each onset group exhibited a unique distribution of atrophy consistent with the functional differences that distinguish the two onset morphologies.\n\nSixteen nonconsecutive patients with medically refractory epilepsy were assigned to HYP or LVF groups according to ictal onset patterns recorded with intracranial depth electrodes. Using preimplant magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), levels of volumetrically defined HA were determined by comparison with matched controls, and the distribution of local atrophy was mapped onto 3D hippocampal surface models.\n\nHYP and LVF groups exhibited significant and equivalent levels of HA ipsilateral to seizure onset. Patients with LVF onset seizures also showed significant contralateral volume reductions. On ipsilateral contour maps HYP patients exhibited an atrophy pattern consistent with classical hippocampal sclerosis (HS), whereas LVF atrophy was distributed more laterally and diffusely. Contralateral LVF maps also showed regions of subicular atrophy.",

        "Viral eradication in chronic hepatitis C patients with sustained virological response (SVR) after interferon (IFN) therapy remains controversial.\n\nDuring a long-term follow-up study, 157 patients with SVR to IFN-alpha-2b-based therapy were investigated with a transcription-mediated amplification (TMA) assay in serum. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody was assessed by measuring the optical density (OD) (Axsym HCV v3.0) and the semiquantitative titres (RIBA HCV v3.0) of the HCV antibodies directed against the core, NS3, NS4 and NS5 proteins. A control group included 23 untreated patients with persistently normal serum alanine aminotransferase and detectable serum HCV-RNA.\n\nThe median duration of follow-up was 4.0 (0-10) years. Serum HCV-RNA remained undetectable in all patients. The mean HCV antibody OD were 93 +/- 19 and 45 +/- 21 before therapy and in the last available serum sample respectively (P=0.001). There was a marked decrease in the HCV antibodies directed against the NS3, NS4 and NS5 proteins (P=0.001), while the core protein titre remained strongly positive. The 23 control patients were followed for a median of 5 (2-14) years. The mean HCV antibody OD were 65 +/- 14 and 64 +/- 19 in the first and the last measurements, respectively (NS), and HCV antibody titres for structural and non-structural proteins remained unchanged.",
        "Bexarotene is the first synthetic retinoid X receptor-selective retinoid (rexinoid) approved for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). However, little is known about the signalling pathways by which it exerts its anticarcinogenic effect.\n\nTo characterize the effects of bexarotene in CTCL cell lines and elucidate the underlying molecular pathways of its antineoplastic effect.\n\nThe cell lines Hut-78, HH and MJ were used. Cell viability was assessed with the XTT assay. The self-renewal potential of cells after bexarotene treatment was studied with the methylcellulose clonogenic assay. Flow cytometry was used to analyse the effects on cell cycle, Ki-67 expression and apoptosis induction. Cell cycle and apoptosis-related protein expression were determined by Western blot and immunofluorescence.\n\nBexarotene induced a loss of viability and more pronounced inhibition of clonogenic proliferation in HH and Hut-78 cells, whereas the MJ line exhibited resistance. Bexarotene upregulated and activated Bax in sensitive lines, although not enough to signal significant apoptosis. Instead, all data point to the inhibition of proliferation, rather than apoptosis, as the main mechanistic action of the rexinoid. Bexarotene signals both G(1) and G(2)/M arrest by the modulation of critical checkpoint proteins. We further found that bexarotene activates p53 by phosphorylation at Ser15, which influences the binding of p53 to promoters for cell cycle arrest, induces p73 upregulation, and, in concordance, also modulates some p53/p73 downstream target genes, such as p21, Bax, survivin and cdc2. Bexarotene-mediated ataxia telangiectasia mutated protein (ATM) activation in all studied lines suggests that ATM is likely to be the p53/p73 upstream activator.",
        "Thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1) is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of multiple genes involved in lung development. It is preferentially expressed in adenocarcinomas of the lung and has been investigated as a potential prognostic parameter in patients with lung cancer, with conflicting results. We quantitatively assessed TTF1 protein expression in two large and independent data sets to investigate the impact of TTF1 nuclear expression on patient survival.\n\nAutomated quantitative analysis, a fluorescent-based method for analysis of in situ protein expression, was used to assess a series of cell lines to find the threshold of detection of TTF1 expression. Then two independent cohorts (176 and 237 cases, respectively) were measured by the same technique, and TTF1 expression was correlated with survival.\n\nTumors expressed TTF1 in 45% and 58% of the cases in each cohort. TTF1 was consistently expressed in adenocarcinomas (n = 61 and 73; Spearman rho = 0.313 and 0.4 for the first and second set, respectively; P < .0001) independent of their differentiation and stage. Survival analysis showed that patients with stage I adenocarcinoma with TTF1 expression had a longer median overall survival than those without expression (n = 43, 44.3 v 26.2 months, P = .05 for the first cohort; n = 87; 49.7 v 38.5 months, P = .03 for the second cohort) Multivariate analysis revealed an independent lower risk of death for patients with stage I adenocarcinoma with TTF1-expressing tumors (hazard ratio = 0.479, 95% CI, 0.235 to 0.977; P = .043).",
        "To determine the acute hemodynamic effects of the nonessential amino acid, glycine, and its precursor, L-serine, in normotensive and hypertensive rats.\n\nChanges in mean arterial pressure and heart rate evoked by comparable intravenously administered doses (0.3-3.0 mmol/kg) of L-serine, D-serine and glycine were examined in anaesthetized normotensive 14-week-old male Sprague-Dawley, Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, spontaneously hypertensive rats and WKY rats subjected to chronic nitric oxide synthase inhibition by treatment with NG nitro L-arginine methyl ester (0.7 mg/ml in drinking water for 5 days).\n\nL-Serine evoked a greater maximal fall in mean arterial pressure [L-serine vs. D-serine in Sprague-Dawley rats, mean +/- standard error of the mean values (mmHg): 30 +/- 3 vs. 20 +/- 5, P < 0.05; in control WKY rats: 46 +/- 3 vs. 30 +/- 4, P < 0.05; in NG nitro L-arginine methyl ester-treated WKY rats: 93 +/- 6 vs. 41 +/- 5, P < 0.01; in spontaneously hypertensive rats: 81 +/- 7 vs. 39 +/- 5 P < 0.01]. The effects of L-serine were significantly reduced in rats pretreated with a combination of apamin and charybdotoxin, inhibitors of the small conductance and intermediate conductance calcium-activated potassium (KCa) channels. Glycine elicited a dose-dependent fall in mean arterial pressure in normotensive WKY rats (25 +/- 4; P < 0.01) and evoked pressor responses in both spontaneously hypertensive rats (29 +/- 3; P < 0.01) and NG nitro L-arginine methyl ester-pretreated hypertensive WKY (39 +/- 5; P < 0.01) rats. Both the depressor and pressor responses to glycine were abolished by pretreatment with the N-methyl D-aspartate receptor antagonist, MK-801.",
        "Duct-to-duct (DD) anastomosis is an accepted procedure for biliary reconstruction in living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). However, biliary complication rates in LDLT recipients have been reported to be as high as 20% to 30% or more. In this study, we examined various potential risk factors for biliary stricture (BS) that occurs in the context of DD reconstruction in a single-active transplant center.\n\nEnrolled in this study were adults who underwent their first LDLT with DD reconstruction between August 2002 and May 2007 (n=283). BSs were defined as anastomotic strictures that required interventions or operative procedures to be corrected. We reviewed retrospectively the medical records of recipients, including medical history, surgical procedures, and progress, and analyzed risk factors of BS with the Kaplan-Meier method.\n\nBS occurred in 58 of the 283 recipients (20.5%). The mean follow-up period was 24.4 months posttransplant (SD=16.5). The univariate analysis revealed that recipient age (P=0.032), bile duct size (P=0.003), biliary reconstruction surgeon (P=0.023), perfusion solution (P=0.001), cold ischemic time (CIT) (P<0.001), and biliary leakage history (P<0.001) were significant risk factors. In the multivariable analysis, CIT (P=0.001), biliary leakage history (P=0.002), bile duct size (P=0.021), and recipient age (P=0.036) were significant risk factors for BS. And, a CIT cutoff value of 71 min was calculated using the minimum P value approach with correction by the Miller and Siegmund method (P=0.0186).",
        "The purpose of this study was to identify the causative gene defect in two siblings with an uncharacterized cone-rod dysfunction and to describe the clinical characteristics.\n\nGenome-wide homozygosity mapping, with a 250K SNP-array followed by a search for candidate genes, was performed. The patients underwent ophthalmic examination, including elaborate electroretinography.\n\nIn a Dutch sib pair, a shared 9-Mb homozygous region was found on 11q13.1-q13.5 that encompasses the CABP4 gene, previously implicated in autosomal recessive incomplete congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB2) in two small families. A novel homozygous p.Arg216X mutation in CABP4 was detected in the sib pair. Quantitative RT-PCR on RNA isolated from patient lymphoblast cells showed no nonsense-mediated degradation of mutant CABP4 mRNA. Clinically, patients presented with reduced visual acuity, photophobia, and abnormal color vision, but they did not experience night blindness. Electroretinograms showed electronegative mixed rod-cone responses and severely reduced cone responses, as in CSNB2. Isolated rod responses, however, were (sub)normal.",
        "More than one half of lower respiratory cultures are negative for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and final reporting requires 72 hours to 96 hours. A previous retrospective study concluded that preliminary bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) culture results (pBAL), reported at approximately 24 hours, accurately predicted final BAL culture results (fBAL). Our objective was to verify the predictive value of pBALs for fBALs, and evaluate the use of insignificant (1-99,999 cfu/mL) pBALs for rapid discontinuation of empirical antibiotics.\n\nAll BALs performed in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the Presley Regional Trauma Center were used to compare pBALs with fBALs. Trauma intensive care unit patients whose antibiotics were discontinued using pBALs (study group), were compared with a historical control group who had their antibiotics discontinued using fBALs.\n\nPreliminary and final results of 474 prospectively collected BALs were compared. Significant pBALs had a positive predictive value of 100%, whereas the negative predictive values of \"no growth to date\" and insignificant pBALs were 99% and 95%, respectively. Study patients (n = 176) were similar to control patients (n = 112) except for a higher median injury severity score (34 vs. 29; p < 0.001). The median (interquartile range) duration of empirical antibiotic therapy in patients without VAP was shorter for study patients [1.5 (1.25, 2) vs. 3 (3, 4) days, p < 0.001]. Empirical antibiotics were temporarily interrupted in four patients with VAP because of falsely negative pBALs without adverse clinical sequelae.",
        "Endocrine gland-derived vascular endothelial growth factor (EG-VEGF)/prokineticins have been identified as tissue-specific angiogenic factors. This study investigates the expression and localization of EG-VEGF and its receptors in pancreatic tissues and pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs).\n\nmRNA levels of EG-VEGF/prokineticin 1 (PK1), prokineticin 2 (PK2) and their receptors 1 (PKR1) and 2 (PKR2) were measured in pancreatic tissues, pancreatic cancer cell lines and PSCs by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR). Protein expression of PK1, PKR1 and PKR2 was assessed in pancreatic tissues by immunohistochemistry. Growth factor-induced secretion of EG-VEGF was measured by ELISA.\n\nQRT-PCR analysis in bulk tissues of normal pancreas, chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma showed no significant difference of PK1 mRNA levels, whereas PK2 mRNA was barely detectable. High PK1 mRNA levels were observed only in cultured PSCs and microdissected islet cells, but not in cancer cells, and PK1 protein was localized mainly in islets and cancer-associated stromal cells. PKR1 and PKR2 proteins were present in endothelial cells of small blood vessels. TGF-beta(1) and PDGF-BB specifically stimulated PK1 secretion in PSCs.",
        "Neurogenic placodes are focal thickenings of the embryonic ectoderm that form in the vertebrate head. It is within these structures that the precursors of the majority of the sensory neurons of the cranial ganglia are specified. The trigeminal placodes, the ophthalmic and maxillomandibular, form close to the midbrain-hindbrain boundary and many lines of evidence have shown that signals emanating from this level of the neuraxis are important for the development of the ophthalmic placode.\n\nHere, we provide the first evidence that both the ophthalmic and maxillomandibular placodes form under the influence of isthmic Wnt and FGF signals. Activated Wnt signals direct development of the Pax3 expressing ophthalmic placodal field and induce premature differentiation of both the ophthalmic and the maxillomandibular placodes. Similarly, overexpression of Fgf8 directs premature differentiation of the trigeminal placodes. Wnt signals require FGF receptor activity to initiate Pax3 expression and, subsequently, the expression of neural markers, such as Brn3a, within the cranial ectoderm. Furthermore, fibroblast growth factor signaling via the mitogen activated protein kinase pathway is required to maintain early neuronal differentiation within the trigeminal placodes.",
        "To assess the impact of intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) versus conventional radiation on late xerostomia and Quality of Life aspects in head and neck cancer patients. PATIENTS AND NETHODS: Questionnaires on xerostomia in rest and during meals were sent to all patients treated between January 1999 and December 2003 with a T1-4, N0-2 M0 head and neck cancer, with parotid gland sparing IMRT or conventional bilateral neck irradiation to a dose of at least 60 Gy, who were progression free and had no disseminated disease (n = 192). Overall response was 85% (n = 163); 97% in the IMRT group (n = 75) and 77% in the control group (n = 88) the median follow-up was 2.6 years. The prevalence of complaints was compared between the two groups, correcting for all relevant factors at multivariate ordinal regression analysis.\n\nPatients treated with IMRT reported significantly less difficulty transporting and swallowing their food and needed less water for a dry mouth during day, night and meals. They also experienced fewer problems with speech and eating in public. Laryngeal cancer patients in general had fewer complaints than oropharynx cancer patients but both groups benefited from IMRT. Within the IMRT group the xerostomia scores were better for those patients with a mean parotid dose to the \"spared\" parotid below 26 Gy.",
        "To explore the combined effect of yeast proteins and surfactants on bacterial metabolism.\n\nProtein-rich cell-free supernatant from heat-shocked yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was combined with certain synthetic surfactants. These blends affected the metabolism of a Polyseed inoculum of aerobic bacteria, accelerating CO(2) production and consumption of nutrients from a sterile nutrient broth solution, without a concomitant accumulation of biomass. It is suggested that in the presence of the yeast protein-surfactant complexes, bacterial electron transport is uncoupled from biomass accumulation. The \"uncoupling hypothesis\" is supported by experiments with model membranes, in which the same complexes induced proton leak similar to standard chemical uncouplers, such as dinitrophenol, indicating that uncoupling may occur at the stage of generation of the transmembrane pH gradient as the driving force for ATP production.",
        "Cancer cells with overexpression of heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) are resistant to chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (Dox). Paclitaxel (Pacl) was reported to suppress HSP27 expression in ovarian and uterine cancer cells. The purposes of this study were to investigate whether Pacl inhibits the expression of HSP27 in breast cancer cells, whether Pacl can sensitize breast cancer cells with HSP27 overexpression to Dox, and to define a more effective schedule for the combination of Dox with Pacl.\n\nThe HSP27 high-expressing human breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-435, and the HSP27 low-expressing cell line, MDA-MB-231, were used in this study. The level of HSP27, topoisomerase (Topo) IIalpha and beta expression were assessed by Western blotting. The cytotoxic activities of Dox, Pacl and combination of these two drugs were evaluated by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and flow cytometric assays.\n\nPacl (0.1 micromol/L) inhibited HSP27 expression by approximately 2-fold in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-435 cells, while up-regulating the level of topo IIalpha and beta. In contrast, expression of HSP27 in MDA-MB-231 did not change significantly following Pacl treatment. There were synergistic effects in both treatment sequences (Pacl-Dox and Dox-Pacl) when Pacl was combined with Dox. Compared with those treated with the Dox-Pacl sequence, the Pacl-Dox sequence had a stronger effect in cancer cells with HSP27 overexpression, as MCF-7 and MDA-MB-435 treated with the Pacl-Dox sequence had lower viabilities and a higher apoptotic rate.",
        "Sun sensitivity is one of the predictors of melanoma risk, together with other individual characteristics such as skin and eye colour and number of naevi. However, it is unclear how best to measure sun sensitivity in order to quantify the individual risk of melanoma.\n\nIn this case-control study, the relationship between minimal erythema dose (MED) and skin colour (both instrumentally assessed) was investigated, and their possible role as independent risk factors for melanoma in a Mediterranean population evaluated.\n\nIn total, 143 patients with cutaneous melanoma and 102 controls were enrolled in the study. Skin colour was assessed using a Minolta CR-200 chromameter. For MED calculation, a fluorescent lamp (Philips TL 4W/12) was used as a source of ultraviolet B light. MED was defined as the lowest dose that produced an increase of 2.5 in the redness value, expressed by the parameter a* of the Commission Internationale d\"Eclairage (CIE) L*a*b* colour space (Deltaa* = 2.5).\n\nA significant excess of risk was associated with increasing L* values of skin colour (P < 0.05; OR = 1.12; 95% CI 1.01-1.24) for each unit of change. Low MED values were also associated with an increasing risk of melanoma, with an excess of risk of 18% (OR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.04-1.35) for every 10 mJ/cm(2) of MED reduction. Compared with the highest MED values (> 97.7 mJ/cm(2)), subjects with MED values <or= 50 euro mJ/cm(2) or lower had a > 2-fold increased risk of melanoma (OR = 2.37, 95% CI 1.05-5.38). The effect of decreasing MED value as a melanoma risk factor persisted after adjustment for skin colour and atypical naevi in a multivariate model.",
        "To investigate whether bone marrow-derived denritic cells pulsed with tumor lysates induce immunity against gastric cancer ex vivo.\n\nc-kit(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells were magnetically isolated with a MiniMACS separator from BALB/c mice bone marrow cells. These cells were cultured with cytokines GM-CSF, IL-4, and TNFalpha to induce their maturation. They were analysed by morphological observation, phenotype analysis, and mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). Bone marrow-derived DCs (BM-DCs) were pulsed with tumor cell lysate obtained by rapid freezing and thawing at a 1:3 DC:tumor cell ratio. Finally, cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity and interferon gamma (IFNgamma) secretion was evaluated ex vivo.\n\nc-kit(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells from mice bone marrow cells cultured with cytokines for 8 d showed the character of typical mature DCs. Morphologically, observed by light microscope, these cells were large with oval or irregularly shaped nuclei and with many small dendrites. Phenotypically, FACS analysis showed that they expressed high levels of Ia, DEC-205, CD11b, CD80 and CD86 antigen, moderate levels of CD40, and negative for F4/80. Functionally, these cells gained the capacity to stimulate allogeneic T cells in MLR assay. However, immature DCs cultured with cytokines for 5 d did not have typical DCs phenotypic markers and could not stimulate allogeneic T cells. Ex vivo primed T cells with SGC-7901 tumor cell lysate-pulsed (TP) DCs were able to induce effective CTL activity against SGC-7901 tumor cells (E:T = 100:1, 69.55% +/- 6.05% specific lysis), but not B16 tumor cells, and produced higher levels of IFNgamma when stimulated with SGC-7901 tumor cells but not when stimulated with B16 tumor cells (1575.31 +/- 60.25 pg/mL in SGC-7901 group vs 164.11 +/- 18.52 pg/mL in B16 group, P < 0.01).",
        "Oxygen toxicity has been identified as a risk factor for adverse neurological outcome in survivors of preterm birth. In infant rodent brains, hyperoxia induces disseminated apoptotic neurodegeneration. Because a tissue-protective effect has been observed for recombinant erythropoietin (rEpo), widely used in neonatal medicine for its hematopoietic effect, we examined the effect of rEpo on hyperoxia-induced brain damage.\n\nSix-day-old C57Bl/6 mice or Wistar rats were exposed to hyperoxia (80% O(2)) or normoxia for 24 hours and received rEpo or normal saline injections intraperitoneally. The amount of degenerating cells in their brains was determined by DeOlmos cupric silver staining. Changes of their brain proteome were determined through two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Western blot, enzyme activity assays and real-time polymerase chain reaction were performed for further analysis of candidate proteins.\n\nSystemic treatment with 20,000 IE/kg rEpo significantly reduced hyperoxia-induced apoptosis and caspase-2, -3, and -8 activity in the brains of infant rodents. In parallel, rEpo inhibited most brain proteome changes observed in infant mice when hyperoxia was applied exclusively. Furthermore, brain proteome changes after a single systemic rEpo treatment point toward a number of mechanisms through which rEpo may generate its protective effect against oxygen toxicity. These include reduction of oxidative stress and restoration of hyperoxia-induced increased levels of proapoptotic factors, as well as decreased levels of neurotrophins.",
        "Our previous pharmacological and cellular studies showed that peripheral (cardiac and vascular) nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-derived NO is implicated in the estrogen (E(2))-dependent hypotensive action of ethanol in female rats. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that enhanced NO production in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) is implicated in the E(2)-dependent hypotensive action of ethanol.\n\nTo achieve this goal, we utilized in vivo electrochemistry to measure real time changes in neuronal NO to investigate the acute effects of intragastric ethanol (0, 0.5, or 1 g/kg) on NO in NTS neurons, blood pressure (BP), and heart rate (HR) in conscious female rats in the absence (ovariectomized, OVX, rats) or presence of E(2).\n\nIn sham operated (SO) rats, ethanol elicited dose-related increase in NTS NO and reduction in BP. These neurochemical and BP effects of ethanol were absent in OVX rats. Whether the neurochemical effect of ethanol and the associated hypotension are dependent on rapid E(2) signaling was investigated. In OVX rats pretreated, 30 minutes earlier, with E(2) (1 microg/kg), intragastric ethanol (1 g/kg) increased NTS NO and reduced BP and these responses were comparable to those obtained in SO rats.",
        "The Gly482Ser polymorphism in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PPARGC1A) has been demonstrated to be associated with diabetes, obesity and hypertension, all of which are important risk factors for left ventricular diastolic dysfunction.\n\nThe PPARGC1A Gly482Ser polymorphism was genotyped in a community-based cohort of 499 men and 533 women, who also underwent an echocardiographic examination to determine their left ventricular diastolic function. The association between the polymorphism and the presence of diastolic dysfunction was evaluated using logistic regression models.\n\nThe Ser allele of the PPARGC1A Gly482Ser polymorphism was significantly associated with a lower risk of diastolic dysfunction in men, but not in women. In a model adjusting for potential confounders (age, body mass index, leisure time physical activity, hypertension and diabetes) the results were still significant and substantial (odds ratio 0.13, 95% confidence interval 0.03-0.54, p for trend = 0.004). The results were consistent in a series of models, and they imply a multiplicative, protective effect of the Ser allele, with lower risk of diastolic dysfunction for each copy of the allele.",
        "Atypical antipsychotics are commonly prescribed to clinically referred youngsters for treatment of heightened aggressive behavior associated with various psychiatric disorders. Previously, we demonstrated risperidone\"s anti-aggressive effects using a well-validated animal model of offensive aggression. Paliperidone, the main active metabolite of risperidone, is a potent serotonin-2A and dopamine-2 receptor antagonist with slightly different pharmacodynamic properties compared to risperidone. Given that much of risperidone\"s therapeutic efficacy is due to its active metabolite, paliperidone may effectively suppress aggression with fewer adverse side effects.\n\nInvestigate whether paliperidone administration would reduce heightened aggressive behavior induced by low-dose cocaine exposure in a developmentally sensitive model of offensive aggression.\n\nMale Syrian hamsters (n = 12/group) were administered an acute dose of paliperidone (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 mg/kg) and then tested for aggressive behavior using the resident-intruder paradigm. To investigate the effects of chronic paliperidone administration, a separate set of animals (n = 12/group) was exposed to repeated paliperidone administration (0.1 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) during different developmental periods and varying lengths of time (1-4 weeks).\n\nExperiment 1 results revealed a dose-dependent decrease in bite and attack behaviors with an effective dose observed at 0.1 mg/kg. In Experiment 2, the maximal reduction in aggressive behavior in response to chronic paliperidone treatment was observed in animals treated during the third week of adolescence, and this reduction occurred without concomitant alterations in non-aggressive behaviors.",
        "Current murine models of sepsis do not account for the effects of aggressive fluid resuscitation on hemodynamics and mortality.\n\nEvaluate the impact of fluid resuscitation regimens on cardiovascular performance and survival in a murine model of sepsis.\n\nMice (n = 90) were made septic by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP), and received antibiotics plus Low, Intermediate, or High fluid resuscitation regimens. Stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), and fractional shortening (FS) were measured by echocardiography at predefined time points.\n\nBaseline echocardiographic measurements were similar in all groups. After CLP, SV and CO decreased early in all groups; High: 57.2 +/- 9.2 to 23.9 +/- 7.2 microL, and 26.8 +/- 4.9 to 13.1 +/- 5.8 ml/min; Intermediate: 52.1 +/- 7.0 to 21.5 +/- 6.6 microL, and 24.9 +/- 4.1 to 11.9 +/- 3.9 ml/min; Low: 54.0 +/- 7.0 to 20.3 +/- 5.6 microL, and 25.8 +/- 4.0 to 11.3 +/- 3.9 ml/min (P < 0.05 for all vs. baseline). With resuscitation there was a dose-dependent improvement in SV and CO (P < 0.05). At 24 h SV and CO were 44.0 +/- 13.8 microL and 20.7 +/- 8.5 ml/min in the High group, 39.8 +/- 12.3 microL and 16.7 +/- 6.5 ml/min in the Intermediate group, and 30.1 +/- 12.4 microL and 14.0 +/- 7.2 ml/min in the Low group. Survival was improved in the High fluid group (75%) compared to the Intermediate (58%) and the Low (35%) resuscitation groups (P < 0.05).",
        "Barth syndrome (BTHS) is a mitochondrial disorder characterized by neutropenia, among other defects. As yet, the correlation between the mitochondrial defect in BTHS and the neutropenia observed in these patients is unclear. In this review, we hope to shed some light upon the correlation between the metabolic properties of neutrophil mitochondria and their susceptibility to the defects observed in BTHS.\n\nBTHS neutrophils avidly expose phosphatidyl serine, a phospholipid that is normally restrained to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Although phosphatidyl serine exposure is usually considered to be a marker for apoptosis, BTHS neutrophils have no other apoptotic features and function normally. It has recently become clear that the respiratory chain in all BTHS tissues lacks super-complex organization, leading to inefficient electron transport. In neutrophils, the super-complex organization of the respiratory chain is disturbed by default, even in healthy individuals. Further disturbance in BTHS patients may lie at the basis of their neutropenia.",
        "To determine the prognostic significance of FOXP3(+) lymphocyte (Treg) density in colorectal cancer compared with conventional histopathologic features and with CD8(+) and CD45RO(+) lymphocyte densities.\n\nTissue microarrays and immunohistochemistry were used to assess the densities of CD8(+), CD45RO(+), and FOXP3(+) lymphocytes in tumor tissue and normal colonic mucosa from 967 stage II and stage III colorectal cancers. These were evaluated for associations with histopathologic features and patient survival.\n\nFOXP3(+) Treg density was higher in tumor tissue compared with normal colonic mucosa, whereas CD8(+) and CD45RO(+) cell densities were lower. FOXP3(+) Tregs were not associated with any histopathologic features, with the exception of tumor stage. Multivariate analysis showed that stage, vascular invasion, and FOXP3(+) Treg density in normal and tumor tissue were independent prognostic indicators, but not CD8(+) and CD45RO(+). High FOXP3(+) Treg density in normal mucosa was associated with worse prognosis (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.51; 95% CI, 1.07 to 2.13; P = .019). In contrast, a high density of FOXP3(+) Tregs in tumor tissue was associated with improved survival (HR = 0.54; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.77; P = .001).",
        "Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in G6PC2 have been reported to be associated with fasting plasma glucose level in several populations of European descent. However, whether G6PC2 variants have a similar effect in other ethnic groups is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of common variants of G6PC2 on type 2 diabetes and related clinical features in a Chinese population.\n\nWe selected four SNPs, rs13387347, rs2232316, rs492594 and rs16856187, tagging all the common variants spanning the G6PC2 gene (r(2) >or= 0.8) based on HapMap Chinese data, and genotyped them in a group of 3,676 Shanghai Chinese individuals, comprising 1,876 cases and 1,800 controls.\n\nThree SNPs were nominally associated with type 2 diabetes, with rs16856187 showing the strongest evidence for association (p = 0.0009, empirical p = 0.0047). Further conditional analysis revealed that the association signal arose from an individual SNP, rs16856187. This SNP was also associated with fasting plasma glucose level in participants with normal glucose regulation (p = 0.0002), with the fasting plasma glucose level observed to increase by 0.067 mmol/l with each copy of the rare C allele.",
        "To conduct a replication study to investigate whether the -945 CTGF genetic variant is associated with systemic sclerosis (SSc) susceptibility or specific SSc phenotype.\n\nThe study population comprised 1180 patients with SSc and 1784 healthy controls from seven independent case-control sets of European ancestry (Spanish, French, Dutch, German, British, Swedish and North American). The -945 CTGF genetic variant was genotyped using a Taqman 5\" allelic discrimination assay.\n\nAn independent association study showed in all the case-control cohorts no association of the CTGF -945 polymorphism with SSc susceptibility. These findings were confirmed by a meta-analysis giving a pooled OR = 1.12 (95% CI 0.99 to 1.25), p = 0.06. Investigation of the possible contribution of the -945 CTGF genetic variant to SSc phenotype showed that stratification according to SSc subtypes (limited or diffuse), selective autoantibodies (anti-topoisomerase I or anticentromere) or pulmonary involvement reached no statistically significant skewing.",
        "Angiogenesis is essential for tumors to grow and metastasize. Lymphatic metastasis is also an important means of tumor spread. In non-small cell lung carcinoma, the relationship of lymphangiogenesis with lymph node metastasis and, ultimately, patient prognosis is unknown.\n\nTo evaluate whether lymphangiogenesis is related to lymph node metastasis and/or overall survival.\n\nSeventy-eight cases of non-small cell lung carcinoma diagnosed from 1987 to 2004 were retrospectively analyzed for intratumoral, peritumoral, and uninvolved adjacent lung tissue lymphatic vessel density (LVD) by D2-40 immunostaining. Lymphatics in 6 cases of squamous dysplasia/carcinoma in situ were similarly evaluated. Appropriate statistical methods were used.\n\nIntratumoral and peritumoral LVD was significantly higher than in the uninvolved adjacent lung but showed no significant association with lymph node stage at the time of tumor resection. Survival in patients with above average D2-40 values was not significantly different when compared with those who had below average values (median survival, 895 vs 1131 days; P = .97). Furthermore, patients with affected lymph nodes had significantly shorter survival (median survival, 467 vs 1425 days; P = .002). Overall, regardless of lymph node status, there was a significantly higher intratumoral (P < .001) and peritumoral (P < .001) LVD when compared with the adjacent uninvolved lung LVD. There was a trend toward increasing LVD with higher grade of squamous dysplasia.",
        "Current treatments for acne scars and enlarged facial pores have shown limited efficacy.\n\nTo evaluate the efficacy and safety of the fractional photothermolysis system (FPS) with dynamic operating mode on acne scars and enlarged pores.\n\nTwelve patients with mild to moderate atrophic acne scars and enlarged pores were included in this study. Three sessions of FPS treatment were performed for acne scars and facial pores monthly. Two blinded dermatologists who compared before and after photos based on a quartile grading scale conducted objective clinical assessments of acne scar- and facial pore-treated areas. We took a biopsy immediately after one treatment with the laser from one of the authors to assess the histologic effects of the laser on facial pores.\n\nFollow-up results at 4 months after the last treatment revealed that, of the 12 patients, for acne scars, five demonstrated clinical improvements of 51% to 75% and three demonstrated improvements of 76% to 100%, and for facial pores, five demonstrated moderate clinical improvements of 26% to 50% and three demonstrated improvements of 76% to 100%. Side effects, including pain, post-treatment erythema, and edema, were resolved within 1 week.",
        "Nitric oxide (NO.) derived from donor drugs has been shown to be an effective chemosensitizer in vitro. We investigated the combination of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene transfer, driven by a strong constitutive promoter (cytomegalovirus; CMV) with the DNA cross-linking agent cisplatin in mouse and human tumour cell lines.\n\nProof of principal experiments were performed in the radiation-induced fibrosarcoma-1 (RIF-1) murine cell line. Cells were transfected with constitutively expressed CMV/iNOS plasmid DNA using a cationic lipid vector, before exposure to cisplatin. In vivo efficacy was determined in an intradermal RIF-1 tumour model, with intraperitoneal administration of cisplatin. Additionally, treatment potential was investigated in various human tumour cell lines including human prostate (DU145 and PC3) and human colon (HT29 and HCT116) cancer cell lines. Experimental endpoints were established using western blot, Greiss test, clonogenic assay and tumour growth delay.\n\nTransfection of RIF-1 tumour cells in vitro with the CMV/iNOS significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of cisplatin (0.2-1.0 microM). In vivo transfer of CMV/iNOS by direct injection into established RIF-1 tumours caused a significant (p = 0.0027) delay in tumour growth. CMV/iNOS gene transfer in vitro resulted in the strong expression of iNOS DNA in all cell lines, and significantly increased levels of NO. in all cell lines except HCT116.",
        "Early vocal development of German-speaking cochlear implant recipients has rarely been assessed so far. There-fore the purpose of this study was to describe the early vocal development following successful implantation.\n\nA case study was designed to assess the temporal progression of early vocal development in a young cochlear implant recipient who was bilaterally implanted at the age of 8;3 months. Data were collected during one year by recording parent-child interactions on a monthly basis. The first recording was made before the onset of the signal-processors, the 12 following recordings were made during the first year of implant use. The child\"s vocalizations were classified according to the vocalization categories and developmental levels from the Stark Assessment of Early Vocal Development--Revised (SAEVD-R). This assessment tool was translated into German in this study and used with German-speaking children for the first time. It allows a coding of prelinguistic utterances via auditory perceptual analysis.\n\nThe results show an overall decrease of early vocalizations and an increase of speech-like vowels and consonants. In the first six months no apparent progress took place; The child produced almost exclusively vocalizations from Levels 1-3. In the second half of the year an increase of canonical utterances (Level 4) and advanced forms (Level 5) was observed. However, vocalizations beyond the canonical babbling phase, especially vocants and closants as well as their combinations, continued to be dominant throughout the first year of implant use. The progress of development of the child investigated in this study is comparable to other children implanted at young age who had also been assessed with the SAEVD-R. In comparison to normal-hearing children, the implanted child\"s development seemed to progress slightly faster. Interrater- and intrarater-reliability using the SAEVD-R were measured for two independent observers and for a first and second coding procedure and revealed to be acceptable to good.",
        "The effects of long-term oral administration of L-arginine, a substrate for nitric oxide (NO) production, on left ventricular (LV) remodeling, myocardial function and the prevention of heart failure (HF) was compared to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril in a rat model of hypertensive HF (aged spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR)).\n\nSHRs and age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were assigned to either no treatment, treatment with L-arginine (7.5 g/l in drinking water) or captopril (1 g/l in drinking water) beginning at 14 months of age, a time when SHRs exhibit stable compensated hypertrophy with no hemodynamic impairment; animals were studied at 23 months of age or at the time of HF.\n\nIn untreated SHR, relative to WKY, there was significant LV hypertrophy, myocardial fibrosis, and isolated LV muscle performance and response to isoproterenol (ISO) were depressed; and, 7 of 10 SHRs developed HF. Captopril administration to six SHRs attenuated hypertrophy and prevented impaired inotropic responsiveness to ISO, contractile dysfunction, fibrosis, increased passive stiffness, and HF. In contrast, L-arginine administration to SHR increased LV hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis while cardiac performance was depressed; and 7 of 9 SHRs developed HF. In WKY, L-arginine treatment but not captopril resulted in increased LV weight and the contractile response to ISO was blunted. Neither L-arginine nor captopril treatment of WKY changed fibrosis and HF did not occur.",
        "Anti-oestrogens have been the mainstay of therapy in patients with oestrogen-receptor (ER) positive breast cancer and have provided significant improvements in survival. However, their benefits are limited by tumour recurrence in a significant proportion of initially drug-responsive breast cancer patients because of acquired anti-oestrogen resistance. Relapse on such therapies clinically presents as local and/or regional recurrences, frequently with distant metastases, and the prognosis for these patients is poor. The selective ER modulator, tamoxifen, classically exerts gene inhibitory effects during the drug-responsive phase in ER-positive breast cancer cells. Paradoxically, this drug is also able to induce the expression of genes, which in the appropriate cell context may contribute to an adverse cell phenotype. Here we have investigated the effects of tamoxifen and fulvestrant treatment on invasive signalling and compared this with the direct effects of oestrogen withdrawal to mimic the action of aromatase inhibitors.\n\nThe effect of oestrogen and 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen on the invasive capacity of endocrine-sensitive MCF-7 cells, in the presence or absence of functional E-cadherin, was determined by Matrigel invasion assays. Studies also monitored the impact of oestrogen withdrawal or treatment with fulvestrant on cell invasion. Western blotting using phospho-specific antibodies was performed to ascertain changes in invasive signalling in response to the two anti-oestrogens versus both oestradiol treatment and withdrawal.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, we report for the first time that tamoxifen can promote an invasive phenotype in ER-positive breast cancer cells under conditions of poor cell-cell contact and suggest a role for Src kinase and associated pro-invasive genes in this process. Our studies revealed that although this adverse effect is also apparent for further classes of anti-oestrogens, exemplified by the steroidal agent fulvestrant, it is absent during oestrogen withdrawal.",
        "The aim of this study was to identify and characterize the causative mutation in the thrombocytopenic mouse strain HLB219 that was generated at the Jackson Laboratory as part of a large-scale N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis screen.\n\nThe HLB219 mutation was identified by interval mapping of F2 mice generated from intercross breeding of HLB219 to both BALB/cByJ (BALB) and 129/SvImJ (129/Sv). Mpl was identified as a candidate gene and sequenced. The mutation was characterized in vivo in mouse hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell assays and in cell culture by expression in Ba/F3 cells.\n\nA novel mutation in the thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor Mpl in HLB219 mice caused a Cys-->Arg substitution at codon 40 in the extracellular region of the receptor. Mice homozygous for the Mpl(hlb219) mutation had an 80% decrease in the number of platelets in comparison to the wild-type C57BL/6J strain, low numbers of bone marrow megakaryocytes, high TPO levels, and decreased competitive repopulating ability, consistent with a loss-of-function mutation in the receptor. Mice heterozygous for Mpl(hlb219) however, showed an overdominance effect with a significant increase in platelet number. Functional analysis in vitro demonstrated that Ba/F3 cells expressing the mutant MPL(hlb219) protein failed to activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase and signal transducers and activators of transcription 5, but proliferated in the absence of TPO and required constitutive phosphorylation of RAC-alpha serine/threonine protein kinase (AKT) for cytokine-independent growth.",
        "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) mediate inflammatory processes and alter cardiac function. However, it is not clear whether inflammatory cytokines or PPAR ligands regulate PPARs in the cardiomyocytes to modulate cardiac functions. We investigated the effects of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and PPAR ligands on the expression of PPARs in HL-1 cardiomyocytes.\n\nHL-1 cardiomyocytes were incubated with and without TNF-alpha (1, 10, 25 and 50 ng mL(-1)) or PPAR ligands (rosiglitazone, pioglitazone and fenofibrate) at concentrations of 0.1, 1 and 10 microM for 24 h. The cells also received SN-50 (NF-kappaB inhibitor, 50 microg mL(-1)), ascorbic acid (100 microM) and coenzyme Q10 (10 microM) alone or combined with TNF-alpha.\n\nUsing reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot, we found that incubation of TNF-alpha (50 ng mL(-1)) for 24 h decreased PPAR-alpha, but increased PPAR-gamma without altering PPAR-delta. These effects were not changed by co-administration of SN-50. However, co-administration of ascorbic acid prevented the effect of TNF-alpha both on PPAR-alpha and PPAR-gamma. Coenzyme Q10 partially attenuated the effect of TNF-alpha on PPAR-gamma but did not alter its effect on PPAR-alpha. The administration of rosiglitazone (10 microM) and pioglitazone (10 microM) for 24 h increased PPAR-gamma mRNA, but did not alter PPAR-alpha or PPAR-delta. Moreover, fenofibrate (0.1, 1 and 10 microM) increased PPAR-gamma without any effects on PPAR-alpha or PPAR-delta.",

        "There are marked mitochondrial abnormalities in parkin-knock-out Drosophila and other model systems. The aim of our study was to determine mitochondrial function and morphology in parkin-mutant patients. We also investigated whether pharmacological rescue of impaired mitochondrial function may be possible in parkin-mutant human tissue.\n\nWe used three sets of techniques, namely, biochemical measurements of mitochondrial function, quantitative morphology, and live cell imaging of functional connectivity to assess the mitochondrial respiratory chain, the outer shape and connectivity of the mitochondria, and their functional inner connectivity in fibroblasts from patients with homozygous or compound heterozygous parkin mutations.\n\nParkin-mutant cells had lower mitochondrial complex I activity and complex I-linked adenosine triphosphate production, which correlated with a greater degree of mitochondrial branching, suggesting that the functional and morphological effects of parkin are related. Knockdown of parkin in control fibroblasts confirmed that parkin deficiency is sufficient to explain these mitochondrial effects. In contrast, 50% knockdown of parkin, mimicking haploinsufficiency in human patient tissue, did not result in impaired mitochondrial function or morphology. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching assays demonstrated a lower level of functional connectivity of the mitochondrial matrix, which further worsened after rotenone exposure.

Previous studies on bimodality have primarily been in populations with a high prevalence of type 2 diabetes, including one study in a white Caucasian population. All studies included participants with known diabetes. The aim of this study was to assess whether a bimodal structure is a general phenomenon in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 2-h plasma glucose that is useful for deriving a common cut point for diabetes in populations of different origin, both including and excluding known diabetes.\n\nThe Evaluation of Screening and Early Detection Strategies for Type 2 Diabetes and Impaired Glucose Tolerance (DETECT-2) project is an international collaboration pooling surveys from all continents. These studies include surveys in which plasma glucose was measured during an oral glucose tolerance test; in total, 43 studies (135,383 participants) from 27 countries were included. A mixture of two normal distributions was fitted to plasma glucose levels, and a cut point for normal glycemia was estimated as their intersection. In populations with a biologically meaningful cut point, bimodality was tested for significance.\n\nDistributions of FPG and 2-h plasma glucose did not, in general, produce bimodal structures useful for deriving cut points for diabetes. When present, the cut points produced were inconsistent over geographical regions.",
        "Because skeletal muscle is one of the target tissues for insulin, skeletal muscle mass might be associated with type 2 diabetes. Serum creatinine is a possible surrogate marker of skeletal muscle mass. The purpose of this study was to determine whether serum creatinine level is associated with type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe study participants were nondiabetic Japanese men (n = 8,570) aged 40-55 years at entry. Type 2 diabetes was diagnosed if fasting plasma glucose was >or=126 mg/dl or if participants were taking oral hypoglycemic medication or insulin.\n\nDuring the 4-year follow-up period, 877 men developed type 2 diabetes. Lower serum creatinine was associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. The multiple-adjusted odds ratio for those who had serum creatinine levels between 0.40 and 0.60 mg/dl was 1.91 (95% CI 1.44-2.54) compared with those who had levels between 0.71 and 0.80 mg/dl.",
        "To study how changes induced on corneal optics by myopic and hyperopic laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) refractive surgery affect the aberration compensation mechanism.\n\nInterventional case series and modeling theory.\n\nWe measured ocular, corneal, and internal aberrations for a 6-mm pupil in 15 myopic and 6 hyperopic eyes with similar age range before and 6 months after standard LASIK. Ocular aberrations were measured using our own developed Hartmann-Shack wavefront sensor, whereas corneal aberrations were calculated by using the elevation data obtained by corneal topography. Ocular, corneal, and internal root mean square (RMS), spherical aberration (SA), coma, and compensation factor were compared for each patient.\n\nAfter myopic LASIK, we obtained an average 1.6-fold increase in ocular RMS, mainly positive SA, and coma, associated with a similar increase in corneal aberrations. In the hyperopes, we found a higher (2.3-fold) induction of ocular aberrations after surgery, mainly negative SA and coma, but without net increases of corneal aberrations. Aberration compensation clearly decreased or even inverted after hyperopic LASIK, decreasing the ocular optical quality in a higher level than myopic LASIK.",
        "Recent guidelines recommend colposcopy for women with atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (ASC-H). objective: To determine whether adjunctive high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing is useful for disease risk assessment in females with ASC-H Papanicolaou (Pap) test results.\n\nHigh-risk HPV prevalence and histopathologic follow-up data on 1187 females with ASC-H ThinPrep Pap test (TPPT) and hrHPV test results were analyzed.\n\nASC-H was reported in 1646 (0.59%) [corrected] of 277 400 (270 338 TPPT and 7062 conventional) Pap test results. The difference in ASC-H detection rates between TPPTs and conventional Pap smears was statistically significant (0.60% vs 0.38%; P = .02). High-risk HPV was detected in 589 (49.6%) of 1187 females with ASC-H TPPT and hrHPV testing. The hrHPV DNA-positive rate in females younger than 40 years was 54.7%, significantly higher than the 36.5% in women 40 years and older. Among 505 females with histopathologic follow-up, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2/3 was identified in 32.7% of hrHPV-positive females compared with 1.2% in hrHPV-negative females. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of ASC-H cytology in conjunction with hrHPV DNA testing results for detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2/3 were 96.1% versus 100.0%, 54.0% versus 68.4%, 35.8% versus 20.8%, and 98.1% versus 100.0% in females younger than 40 years and women 40 years and older, respectively.",
        "According to the Montreal Classification, upper gastrointestinal tract phenotype L4 is uncommon in Caucasian patients with Crohn\"s disease (CD) but carries excess risk of recurrence. We studied the clinical course of CD in Chinese patients presenting with the L4 phenotype and factors predicting its occurrence upon longitudinal follow-up.\n\nThis prospective cohort study included 132 Chinese CD patients (median age at diagnosis, 30.0 years, range: 14.0-77.0 years) who were followed for 770 person-years. Demographic data including disease behavior and location, details of surgery, and hospitalization were collected. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the probabilities of further hospitalization and major surgery followed by Cox proportional hazards regression to determine if clinical variables independently predicted the endpoints.\n\nThe L4 phenotype was found in 30 (22.7%) patients at presentation. There were significantly more stricturing (46.7% versus 18.6%) and penetrating (30.0% versus 3.9%) phenotypes in the L4 group than in the non-L4 group (P < 0.0001). The 3-year cumulative probability of further hospitalization was 86.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 73.8%-100.0%) in the L4 group as compared with 49.3% (95% CI: 39.3%-59.3%) in the non-L4 group (log-rank test, P < 0.0001). The L4 phenotype independently predicted further hospitalization (adjusted hazards ratio [HR]: 2.1; 95% CI: 1.3-3.5). The cumulative probability of major surgery was significantly higher in the L4 than in the non-L4 group (P < 0.0001). Eighteen (17.6%) patients developed the L4 phenotype on follow-up and the stricturing phenotype predicted its occurrence (adjusted HR: 5.5; 95% CI: 2.2-14.0).",
        "Acute renal failure after cardiac surgery increases in-hospital mortality. We evaluated the effect of intra- and postoperative tight control of blood glucose levels on renal function after cardiac surgery based on the Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage kidney failure (RIFLE) criteria, and on the need for acute postoperative dialysis.\n\nWe retrospectively analyzed two groups of consecutive patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass between August 2004 and June 2006. In the first group, no tight glycemic control was implemented (Control, n = 305). Insulin therapy was initiated at blood glucose levels > 150 mg/dL. In the group with tight glycemic control (Insulin, n = 745), intra- and postoperative blood glucose levels were targeted between 80 to 110 mg/dL, using the Aalst Glycemia Insulin Protocol. Postoperative renal impairment or failure was evaluated with the RIFLE score, based on serum creatinine, glomerular filtration rate and/or urinary output. We used the Cleveland Clinic Severity Score to compare the predicted vs observed incidence of acute postoperative dialysis between groups.\n\nMean blood glucose levels in the Insulin group were lower compared to the Control group from rewarming on cardiopulmonary bypass onwards until ICU discharge (p < 0.0001). Median ICU stay was 2 days in both groups. In non-diabetics, strict perioperative blood glucose control was associated with a reduced incidence of renal impairment (p = 0.01) and failure (p = 0.02) scoring according to RIFLE criteria, as well as a reduced incidence of acute postoperative dialysis (from 3.9% in Control to 0.7% in Insulin; p < 0.01). The 30-day mortality was lower in the Insulin than in the Control group (1.2% vs 3.6%; p = 0.02), representing a 70% decrease in non-diabetics (p < 0.05) and 56.1% in diabetics (not significant). The observed overall incidence of acute postoperative dialysis was adequately predicted by the Cleveland Clinic Severity Score in the Control group (p = 0.6), but was lower than predicted in the Insulin group (1.2% vs 3%, p = 0.03).",
        "Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine involved in cystitis and a non-cognate ligand of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 in vitro. We studied whether CXCR4-MIF associations occur in rat bladder and the effect of experimental cystitis.\n\nTwenty male rats received saline or cyclophosphamide (40 mg/kg; i.p.; every 3(rd) day) to induce persistent cystitis. After eight days, urine was collected and bladders excised under anesthesia. Bladder CXCR4 and CXCR4-MIF co-localization were examined with immunhistochemistry. ELISA determined MIF and stromal derived factor-1 (SDF-1; cognate ligand for CXCR4) levels. Bladder CXCR4 expression (real-time RTC-PCR) and protein levels (Western blotting) were examined. Co-immunoprecipitations studied MIF-CXCR4 associations.Urothelial basal and intermediate (but not superficial) cells in saline-treated rats contained CXCR4, co-localized with MIF. Cyclophosphamide treatment caused: 1) significant redistribution of CXCR4 immunostaining to all urothelial layers (especially apical surface of superficial cells) and increased bladder CXCR4 expression; 2) increased urine MIF with decreased bladder MIF; 3) increased bladder SDF-1; 4) increased CXCR4-MIF associations.",
        "Kolaviron, a bioflavonoid isolated from the seeds of Garcinia kola has been reported to possess anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antigenotoxic and hepatoprotective activities in model systems via multiple biochemical mechanisms. The present study investigated the possible molecular mechanisms underlying the hepatoprotective effects of kolaviron.\n\nBiomarkers of hepatic oxidative injury, histological and immunohistochemical techniques were used. In addition, the protein expression levels of cyclooxygenase (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were evaluated by western blotting while DNA-binding activities of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) were determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay.\n\nKolaviron administered orally at doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg for 7 days significantly lowered the activities of serum transaminases and gamma-glutamyl tranferase induced by single intraperitoneal administration of dimethyl nitrosamine (DMN) (20 mg/kg) and preserved the integrity of the hepatocytes. Also, kolaviron at both doses reduced the DMN induced elevated hepatic levels of malondialdehyde and reversed DMN mediated decrease in hepatic glutathione. The hepatoprotective effect of kolaviron was compared to that of curcumin, an established hepatoprotective agent. Kolaviron inhibited the DMN induced expression of COX-2 and iNOS. Immunohistochemical staining of rat liver verified the inhibitory effect of kolaviron on DMN-induced hepatic COX-2 expression. Furthermore, kolaviron abrogated DMN induced binding activity of NF-kappaB as well as AP-1.",
        "To investigate the effects of resveratrol on liver ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats.\n\nA total of 40 male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 240-290 g were randomized into four groups of ten: (1) controls: data from unmanipulated animals; (2) sham group: rats subjected to the surgical procedure, except for liver I/R, and given saline; (3) I/R group: rats underwent liver ischemia for 45 min followed by reperfusion for 45 min; (4) I-R/Resveratrol group: rats pretreated with resveratrol (10 micromol/L, iv). Liver tissues were obtained to determine antioxidant enzyme levels and for biochemical and histological evaluation.\n\nPlasma aminotransferase activities were higher in the I/R group than in the I-R/Resveratrol group. Malondialdehyde levels and the hepatic injury score decreased, while superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase levels increased in group 4 compared to group 3. In group 4, histopathological changes were significantly attenuated in resveratrol-treated livers.",
        "Most pharmacogenomic studies have attempted to identify single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers that are predictive for treatment outcomes. It is, however, unlikely in complex diseases such as epilepsy, affecting heterogeneous populations, that a single SNP will adequately explain treatment outcomes. This study reports an approach to develop a multi-SNP model to classify treatment outcomes for such a disease and compares this with single-SNP models.\n\nA prospectively collected dataset of outcomes in 115 patients newly treated for epilepsy, with genotyping for 4041 SNPs in 279 candidate genes, was used for the model development. A cross-validation-based methodology identified SNPs most influential in predicting seizure control after 1 year of drug treatment and then incorporated these into a multi-SNP classification model; using the k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) supervised learning approach. The classifier was cross-validated to determine its effectiveness in predicting treatment outcome in the developmental cohort and then in two independent validation cohorts. In each, the classification by the multi-SNP model was compared with that of models using the individual SNPs alone.\n\nFive SNPs were selected for the multi-SNP model. Cross-validation showed that the multi-SNP model had a predictive accuracy of 83.5% in the developmental cohort and sensitivity and positive predictive values above 80% in both the independent validation cohorts. In all cases, the multi-SNP model classified the treatment outcomes better than those using any individual SNPs alone.",
        "Soil water deficit is a major abiotic stress with severe consequences for the development, productivity and quality of crops. However, it is considered a positive factor in grapevine management (Vitis vinifera), as it has been shown to increase grape quality. The effects of soil water deficit on organogenesis, morphogenesis and gas exchange in the shoot were investigated.\n\nShoot organogenesis was analysed by distinguishing between the various steps in the development of the main axis and branches. Several experiments were carried out in pots, placed in a greenhouse or outside, in southern France. Soil water deficits of various intensities were imposed during vegetative development of the shoots of two cultivars (\"Syrah\" and \"Grenache N\").\n\nAll developmental processes were inhibited by soil water deficit, in an intensity-dependent manner, and sensitivity to water stress was process-dependent. Quantitative relationships with soil water were established for all processes. No difference was observed between the two cultivars for any criterion. The number of leaves on branches was particularly sensitive to soil water deficit, which rapidly and strongly reduced the rate of leaf appearance on developing branches. This response was not related to carbon availability, photosynthetic activity or the soluble sugar content of young expanding leaves. The potential number of branches was not a limiting factor for shoot development.",
        "In vivo inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 by fluvoxamine causes a reduction in the clearance of the high-extraction drug lidocaine, which decreases in proportion to the degree of liver dysfunction. The objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate the effect of liver cirrhosis on the inhibition by fluvoxamine of the metabolic disposition of theophylline, a CYP1A2 substrate with a low-extraction ratio, to assess whether decreased sensitivity to CYP1A2 inhibition in liver disease is a general characteristic of CYP1A2 substrates, regardless of their pharmacokinetic properties, and (2) to investigate the mechanism(s) underlying the effect of liver dysfunction on CYP1A2 inhibition.\n\nThe study was carried out in 10 healthy volunteers and 20 patients with cirrhosis, 10 with mild liver dysfunction (Child class A) and 10 with severe liver dysfunction (Child class C), according to a randomized, double-blind, 2-phase, crossover design. In one phase all participants received placebo for 7 days; in the other phase they received one 50-mg fluvoxamine dose for 2 days and two 50-mg fluvoxamine doses, 12 hours apart, in the next 5 days. On day 6, 4 mg/kg of theophylline was administered orally 1 hour after the morning fluvoxamine dose. Concentrations of theophylline and its metabolites, 3-methylxanthine, 1-methyluric acid, and 1,3-dimethyluric acid, were then measured in plasma and urine up to 48 hours.\n\nFluvoxamine-induced inhibition of theophylline clearance decreased from 62% in healthy subjects to 52% and 12% in patients with mild cirrhosis and those with severe cirrhosis, respectively. CYP1A2-mediated formations of 3-methylxanthine and 1-methyluric acid were almost totally inhibited in control subjects, whereas they were only reduced by one third in patients with Child class C cirrhosis. Inhibition of 1,3-dimethyluric acid formation, which is catalyzed by CYP1A2 and CYP2E1, progressively decreased from 58% in healthy subjects to 43% and 7% in patients with mild cirrhosis and those with severe cirrhosis, respectively.",
        "Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is a highly microbiocidal agent active against bacteria, viruses and fungi. Using quantitative microbiology, preliminary studies showed it achieved an appreciable reduction in the bacterial burden in chronic venous leg ulcers. The study aimed to determine whether it has a role as an additional treatment for chronic venous ulcers that have not healed with conventional treatment.\n\nOn the basis of previous reports we designed a study in which patients acted as their own controls, in that only patients who failed to achieve a 44% reduction in wound size with standard treatment (compression bandaging) received HOCl washes.\n\nOf 30 patients admitted to the study, 10 achieved a 44% ulcer reduction after three weeks of standard treatment. In addition to the standard compression treatment, the remaining 20 patients were given HOCl washes over 12 weeks. Of the 20 ulcers, nine (45%) healed and five (25%) reduced in size by over 60%. All patients became free of pain.",
        "Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is associated with pathologic changes in hippocampal physiology and morphology. Our aim was to quantify volume reduction of the right and left hippocampus in patients with TLE and to investigate whether the degree of hippocampal atrophy is related to the side of seizure onset.\n\nThe volume of the right and left hippocampus was estimated for 50 controls and 101 patients with TLE, by applying the unbiased Cavalieri method on MR images.\n\nPairwise comparisons, within a multivariate analysis of variance and adjusted by using the Bonferroni correction, revealed that both right and left hippocampal volumes were, on average, significantly smaller in patients with right-sided seizure onset (R-patients) relative to those of controls (P < .001 and P = .04, respectively). Furthermore, left hippocampal volume was significantly smaller in patients with left-sided seizure onset (L-patients) compared with controls (P < .001), but the right-sided hippocampal volume was not significantly smaller (P = .71). Moreover, a correlation analysis revealed that the strong linear association between the right and left hippocampal volumes existing in the control population (r = 0.73) is partially lost in patients with TLE (r < or = 0.48), and this loss in correlation appears to be more pronounced in L-patients than in R-patients.",

        "Actin distribution in root hair tips is a controversial topic. Although the relationship between Ca2+ gradient and actin dynamics in plant tip-growth has been a focus of study, there is still little direct evidence on the exact relationship in root hair tip-growth.\n\nG-actin was labelled by fluorescein isothiocyanate-DNase I. F-actin was labelled by tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-phalloidin. Actin in root hairs of Triticum aestivum (wheat) was investigated using confocal laser-scanning microscopy.\n\nThick F-actin bundles did not extend into a region of approx. 5-10 microm from the tip of the growing root hairs, although they gave off branches of fine actin filaments in the hair tips. A tip-focused G-actin gradient was shown at the extreme apex of growing root hairs. In full-grown wheat root hairs, the tip-focused G-actin gradient disappeared while the thick F-actin bundles extended into the tips. BAPTA-AM, a Ca2+ disruption agent, also caused the tip-focused G-actin gradient to disappear and the diffuse F-actin bundles to appear in the tips of wheat root hairs.",
        "Several studies have described that oxytocin exerts stimulatory or inhibitory effects on gut functions. Recently, mRNA for oxytocin and its receptor was found throughout the entire human gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The aim of this study was to examine the cellular localization and distribution of the corresponding proteins.\n\nFull-thickness biopsies from 24 patients, covering the entire GI tract, were collected during operations at the Department of Surgery in Malm\u00f6 and Lund. The biopsies were taken from non_affected margins. The biopsies were fixed by immersion, rinsed in buffered sucrose, and kept frozen at 70 degrees C. Indirect immunofluorescence with primary antibodies to oxytocin and its receptor was used.\n\nOxytocin was expressed in nerve cell bodies and nerve fibres in the myenteric and submucous ganglia all along the GI tract. Immunoreactive nerve cell bodies in myenteric ganglia predominated in the proximal (antrum and duodenum) and distal gut, while those in the submucous ganglia were more numerous in the ileum and colon. The oxytocin receptor was not detectable by two different antibodies in any tissue in the GI tract.",
        "Studies showing that osteoblasts exhibit a more differentiated phenotype on rough titanium (Ti) surfaces and osteoclast-resorbed bone surfaces used materials characterized by average peak to valley distance (Ra). Other surface features impacting the cells include distance between peaks, curvature of the valleys, and relative distribution of flat and smooth regions. We used novel Ti surfaces prepared by electrochemical micromachining as models to examine specific contributions of individual design features to osteoblast response. Results show that micron-scale topography modulates cell number, cell morphology and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). In the presence of the appropriate microtopography, submicron-scale rugosity modulates differentiation and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) levels. In this study, we examined the role of different types of submicron-scale structures.\n\nThirty micrometer diameter craters on Ti disks were produced by photolithography resulting in an electropolished smooth surface, and arranged so that inside crater area vs. outside flat area was 6 (30/6). Submicron-scale structures were superposed by acid etching and porous anodization. Ra\"s were 700, 400, 60 nm on acid-etched, porous anodized and smooth 30/6 surfaces, respectively.\n\nMG63 osteoblast-like cells were sensitive to submicron-scale architecture. Cell morphology on anodized surfaces was similar to morphology on smooth surfaces, whereas on etched surfaces, cells had a more elongated differentiated shape. Cell number was greatest on smooth surfaces > anodized > etched. Osteocalcin and PGE2 were affected in a reverse manner. Active TGF-beta1 was greatest on etched 30/6 surfaces > anodized > smooth; latent TGF-beta1 was elevated on all rough surfaces.",
        "The aim of this study was to perform an in vitro comparison of six bone collectors for harvesting of particulate bone.\n\nFour commercially available bone collectors (Frios, Osseous Coagulum Trap, ACE Autografter, Bone Trap) and two custom-designed models were tested. Three different in vitro tests were performed to determine the harvesting capabilities of the collectors. In test I, a bovine mandible was drilled and the bone collectors were used to collect bone chips. The harvested bone volumes and dry weights were measured after harvesting. In test II, three dental implant sites were prepared in a bovine mandible. The bones from the implant osteotomies were collected, and bone volumes and dry weights were measured. In test III, 1 ml of bone chips was mixed with water, and suctioned through the bone collectors. The volumes of the bone chips retained were measured to determine the efficiency of each collector.\n\nThe Osseous Coagulum Trap and the custom-made collectors were the most effective instruments in test I. The mean volumes ranged from 0.17 to 0.38 ml. In test II, the difference between the collectors was small and the bone volume ranged from 0.28 to 0.37 ml. In test III, the Bone Trap became blocked before the other collectors, and its bone procurement was therefore limited.",
        "Alaska Native children have high Helicobacter pylori infection and iron deficiency prevalences, and their average height-for-age is lower than US reference populations. During a clinical trial to determine the impact of H. pylori treatment on iron deficiency, we evaluated the effects of H. pylori infection and treatment on growth.\n\nWe measured height and weight for children aged 7-11 years in western Alaska using village-based measuring devices. H. pylori infection was determined by urea breath test and iron deficiency using serum ferritin. Children with H. pylori infection and iron deficiency entered the treatment phase and received iron alone or iron plus triple therapy for H. pylori. Follow-up evaluations occurred at 2, 8, and 14 months. We evaluated the association between baseline H. pylori infection and growth; among children in the treatment phase, we also assessed the effect of H. pylori resolution on growth.\n\nAt baseline, 566 (87.1%) of 650 children were infected with H. pylori. Neither height and weight, nor body mass index differed by H. pylori infection status. Of 189 children in the treatment phase, 20 (10.6%) were uninfected at all three follow-up periods, and 54 (28.6%) were uninfected for one or two periods. Compared with continuously infected children, children in these two groups had little evidence of improvements in any of the measured growth outcomes.",
        "The colonization of the gastric mucosa with Helicobacter pylori is accompanied by elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, and IL-8. The aim of our study was to determine the mechanisms of IL-6 stimulation in phagocytes upon H. pylori infection.\n\nWe investigated the secretion of IL-6 by different professional phagocytes from murine and human origin, including granulocyte- and monocyte-like cells and macrophages derived from human peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs). The influence of viability, phagocytosis, and the impact of different subcellular fractions of H. pylori bacteria were evaluated.\n\nIL-6 levels induced by H. pylori were low in cell lines derived from murine and human monocytes and in human granulocyte-like cells. By contrast, macrophages derived from human PBMCs were highly responsive to both H. pylori and Escherichia coli. IL-6 induction was blocked by inhibition of actin-dependent processes prior to infection with H. pylori, but not with E. coli or E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Using cell fractionation, the most activity was found in the H. pylori membrane. H. pylori LPS exhibited a 10(3)- to 10(4)-fold lower biologic activity than E. coli LPS, suggesting a minor role for toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated signalling from the exterior.",
        "Mycolic acid (MA) constitutes a major and distinguishing cell wall biolipid from Mycobacterium tuberculosis. MA interferes with the lipid homeostasis of alveolar macrophages, inducing differentiation into foamy macrophages exhibiting increased proinflammatory function.\n\nWe verified the interference of this altered macrophage function with inhaled antigen-triggered allergic airway inflammation and underlying Th2 lymphocyte reactivity.\n\nUsing ovalbumin (OVA) as model allergen, C57BL/6 or BALB/C mice were sensitized by OVA-alum immunization. Experimental asthma, triggered subsequently by repetitive nebulized OVA inhalation, was assessed, using as readout parameters eosinophilia, peribronchial inflammation, and Th2 cytokine function.\n\nA single intratracheal treatment of sensitized mice with MA, inserted into liposomes as carriers, prevented the onset of OVA-triggered allergic airway inflammation and promoted unresponsiveness to a secondary set of allergen exposures. The development of this tolerant condition required an 8-d lapse after MA instillation, coinciding with the appearance of foamy alveolar macrophages. MA-conditioned CD11b(+)F4/80(+) macrophages, transferred to the airways, mimicked the tolerogenic function of instilled MA; however, without the 8-d lapse requirement. Indicative of a macrophage-mediated tolerogenic antigen-presenting function, major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mismatched donor macrophages failed to promote tolerance. Furthermore, Treg markers were strongly increased and established tolerance was lost after in situ depletion of CD25(+) Treg cells. Contrary to the interleukin-10 dependence of tolerogenic dendritic cells, IFN-gamma deficiency but not interleukin-10 deficiency abrogated the tolerogenic capacity of MA-conditioned macrophages.",
        "In gene networks, the timing of significant changes in the expression level of each gene may be the most critical information in time course expression profiles. With the same timing of the initial change, genes which share similar patterns of expression for any number of sampling intervals from the beginning should be considered co-expressed at certain level(s) in the gene networks. In addition, multiple testing problems are complicated in experiments with multi-level treatments when thousands of genes are involved.\n\nTo address these issues, we first performed an ANOVA F test to identify significantly regulated genes. The Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) procedure of controlling false discovery rate (FDR) at 5% was applied to the P values of the F test. We then categorized the genes with a significant F test into 4 classes based on the timing of their initial responses by sequentially testing a complete set of orthogonal contrasts, the reverse Helmert series. For genes within each class, specific sequences of contrasts were performed to characterize their general \"fluctuation\" shapes of expression along the subsequent sampling time points. To be consistent with the BH procedure, each contrast was examined using a stepwise Studentized Maximum Modulus test to control the gene based maximum family-wise error rate (MFWER) at the level of alphanew determined by the BH procedure. We demonstrated our method on the analysis of microarray data from murine olfactory sensory epithelia at five different time points after target ablation.",
        "To evaluate the preemptive effects of diclofenac sodium, in combination with remifentanil and ketamine.\n\nA prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial was carried out at the Hacettepe University Hospital, Ankara, Turkey from September to December 2004. Forty-three, American Society of Anesthesiology physical status group I-II women, aged >18 years, who would undergo both diagnostic and operative laparoscopic surgery were randomly assigned into 2 groups. All patients received intraoperative 0.1 microg x kg(-1)min(-1) remifentanil infusion. Diclofenac (1 mg x kg(-1) intramuscular) was administered, 20 minutes before the operation. Ketamine (0.8 mg x kg(-)1 intravenously) was administered 5 minutes before the skin incision and at completion of skin closure. We divided the patients into 2 groups; Group I (diclofenac + remifentanil + ketamine), Group II (remifentanil + ketamine). Pain was evaluated postoperatively using the visual analogue scale (VAS) while global satisfaction by verbal rating scale (VRS).\n\nAll 43 female patients have a mean +/- SD age of 32.3 +/- 6.5 years, height of 163 +/- 5.3 cm, and weight of 62.9 +/- 9.5 kg.

Both the Ryk-deficient mouse and Ephb2/Ephb3 (genes for interaction molecules with RYK) double-mutant mouse show cleft palate.\n\nMutation searches for RYK, EPHB2, and EPHB3 were carried out in a large number of Japanese and Vietnamese patients with cleft lip and/or palate and cleft palate only. Case-control study and transmission disequilibrium tests were performed also, using three single nucleotide polymorphisms within a linkage disequilibrium block in RYK. Seven haplotypes were constructed from the single nucleotide polymorphisms.\n\nA missense mutation, 1355G>A (Y452C), in RYK was identified in one Vietnamese patient with cleft lip and/or palate. This mutation was not found among 1646 Vietnamese, Japanese, and Caucasians, including 354 cleft lip and/ or palate and cleft palate only patients. Colony formation assay using NIH3T3 cells transfected with mutant cDNA revealed that mutant RYK had significantly reduced protein activity, compared with those with wild-type RYK, implying that the transformation ability of RYK is depleted by this mutation. Although a case-control study and transmission disequilibrium tests on three individual single nucleotide polymorphisms provided no evidence for association with oral clefts, a case-control study on one rare haplotype suggested a positive association in Japanese patients with cleft lip and/or palate and cleft palate only. No mutations in EPHB2 and EPHB3 were found in any patients examined.",
        "To determine whether genetic influences account for individual differences in susceptibility to falls in older women.\n\nProspective twin cohort study.\n\nResearch laboratory and residential environment.\n\nNinety-nine monozygotic (MZ) and 114 dizygotic (DZ) female twin pairs aged 63 to 76 from the Finnish Twin Cohort study.\n\nThe participants recorded their falls on a calendar for an average+/-standard deviation of 344+/-41 days. Reported falls were verified via telephone interview, and circumstances, causes, and consequences of the fall were asked about.\n\nThe total number of falls was 434, of which 188 were injurious; 91 participants had two or more falls. Casewise concordance was 0.61 (95% confidence interval (CI)=0.49-0.72) for MZ twins and 0.49 (95% CI=0.37-0.62) for DZ twins for at least one fall, 0.38 (95% CI=0.23-0.53) for MZ and 0.33 (95% CI=0.17-0.50) for DZ twins for at least one injurious fall, and 0.43 (95% CI=0.26-0.60) for MZ and 0.36 (95% CI=0.17-0.55) for DZ twins for recurrent falls. On average, the proportion of familial influences accounting for the individual differences in susceptibility to at least one fall was 30% and to recurrent falls was 40%; nongenetic familial and nonfamilial factors alone accounted for susceptibility to at least one injurious fall.",
        "To assess the inter-informant reliability, intra-informant reliability and internal consistency of the NEO-FFI as a measure of premorbid personality in patients with Alzheimer\"s Disease (AD).\n\nOne hundred and five persons with NINCDS-ADRDA probable AD for the assessment of inter-informant reliability and internal consistency, and 30 for the assessment of intra-informant reliability.\n\nPremorbid personality was rated retrospectively by close relatives remembering the patient as he/she had been when aged in his/her forties. One hundred and five AD patients were rated by two separate informants. Thirty AD patients were rated by the same informant on separate occasions one year apart.\n\nInter-informant reliability for the five domain scores of the NEO-FFI was shown to range from fair to good when measured using the single measure Intraclass Correlation Co-efficient (ICC) (0.52-0.64), and to range from good to excellent when measured using the average ICC (0.68-0.78). Intra-informant reliability for four out of the five domains was shown to be excellent when measured using the single ICC (0.81-0.92), and good for the remaining domain (0.72). Intra-informant reliability was found to be excellent for all five domains when measured using the average ICC (0.84-0.96). Internal consistency of the five domains was good.",
        "Although the ocular motility examination has been used traditionally in the diagnosis of strabismus that is a result of cranial nerve (CN) abnormalities, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) now permits the direct imaging of lesions in CN palsies.\n\nProspectively, nerves to extraocular muscles (EOMs) were imaged with T1 weighting in orbits of 83 orthotropic volunteers and 96 strabismic patients in quasicoronal planes using surface coils. Intraorbital resolution was 234-312 microns within 1.5- to 2.0-mm thick planes. CNs were imaged at the brainstem using head coils and T2 weighting, yielding 195 micron resolution in planes 1.0-mm thick in 6 normal volunteers and 22 patients who had oculomotor (CN3), trochlear (CN4), or abducens (CN6) palsies and Duane syndrome.\n\nOculomotor (CN3) and abducens (CN6) but not trochlear (CN4) nerves were demonstrable in the orbit and skull base in all normal subjects. Patients with congenital CN3 palsies had hypoplastic CN3s both in orbit and skull base, with hypoplasia of involved EOMs. Patients with chronic CN6 and CN4 palsies exhibited atrophy of involved EOMs. Patients with Duane syndrome exhibited absence or hypoplasia of CN6 in both orbit and brainstem regions, often with mild hypoplasia and apparent misdirection of CN3 to the lateral rectus muscle. Unlike CN6 palsy, patients with Duane syndrome exhibited no EOM hypoplasia. Patients with congenital fibrosis exhibited severe hypoplasia of CN3, moderate hypoplasia of CN6, and EOM hypoplasia, particularly severe for the superior rectus and levator muscles.",
        "To determine whether the response to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) monotherapy in subjects of African origin is determined by genetic variants within the angiotensinogen (AGT) gene.\n\nA total of 194 hypertensive patients of African ancestry were recruited from district clinics in Johannesburg, South Africa. Eighty patients received open-label ACEI (enalapril or lisinopril) monotherapy, and 114 open-label calcium antagonist (nifedipine) as a drug class comparator. Twenty-four hour ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitoring was performed at baseline (off medication) and after 2 months of therapy. DNA was analysed for functional variants (-217G-->A and -20A-->C) of the AGT gene. The impact of genotype on ABP responses to ACEI monotherapy or calcium antagonists; and on plasma aldosterone and renin levels after ACEI monotherapy was assessed.\n\nAdjusting for baseline ABP and type of ACEI in the ACEI-treated group, the -217G-->A variant predicted ABP responses to ACEI (n = 77; P < 0.01), but not to nifedipine (n = 108). ACEI in patients with the AA genotype of the -217G-->A variant failed to elicit an antihypertensive response [change in ABP, mmHg: systolic blood pressure (SBP) +0.84 +/- 2.89, P = 0.78; diastolic blood pressure (DBP) -0.47 +/- 1.74, P = 0.79]. In contrast, those patients with at least one copy of the -217G allele developed a 7.23 +/- 1.55 and 5.38 +/- 1.12 mmHg decrease (P < 0.0001) in SBP and DBP, respectively, after ACEI administration. Similarly, the -20A-->C variant predicted ABP responses to ACEI monotherapy (P < 0.01) but not to nifedipine. Moreover, patients who were AA genotype for both variants failed to develop an antihypertensive response to ACEI (change in ABP, mmHg: SBP +1.06 +/- 3.05, P = 0.73; DBP -0.39 +/- 1.83, P = 0.83); whereas patients with at least one copy of both the -217G and the -20C allele developed substantial decreases in ABP (change in ABP, mmHg: SBP -14.08 +/- 3.72, P < 0.0001; DBP -9.62 +/- 2.74, P < 0.0001). Patients with at least one copy of the -217G allele demonstrated a significant reduction in the aldosterone-to-renin ratio (-0.098 +/- 0.035, P < 0.01), whereas in those patients who were -217AA genotype the ratio was unchanged (-0.03 +/- 0.16, P = 0.85).",
        "Ondansetron, a serotonin-3 receptor antagonist, reduces postoperative shivering. Drugs that reduce shivering usually impair central thermoregulatory control, and may thus be useful for preventing shivering during induction of therapeutic hypothermia. We determined, therefore, whether ondansetron reduces the major autonomic thermoregulatory response thresholds (triggering core temperatures) in humans.\n\nControl (placebo) and ondansetron infusions at the target plasma concentration of 250 ng ml(-1) were studied in healthy volunteers on two different days. Each day, skin and core temperatures were increased to provoke sweating; then reduced to elicit peripheral vasoconstriction and shivering. We determined the core-temperature sweating, vasoconstriction and shivering thresholds after compensating for changes in mean-skin temperature. Data were analysed using t-tests and presented as means (sds); P<0.05 was taken as significant.\n\nOndensetron plasma concentrations were 278 (57), 234 (55) and 243 (58) ng ml(-1) at the sweating, vasoconstriction and shivering thresholds, respectively; these corresponded to approximately 50 mg of ondansetron which is approximately 10 times the dose used for postoperative nausea and vomiting. Ondansetron did not change the sweating (control 37.4 (0.4) degrees C, ondansetron 37.6 (0.3) degrees C, P=0.16), vasoconstriction (37.0 (0.5) degrees C vs 37.1 (0.3) degrees C; P=0.70), or shivering threshold (36.3 (0.5) degrees C vs 36.3 (0.6) degrees C; P=0.76). No sedation was observed on either study day.",
        "The clinical management of colorectal malignancies that arise via the mismatch repair gene pathway may differ from those that arise from the more common loss of heterozygosity pathway. They respond differently to chemotherapy, have a different prognosis and are associated with a raised incidence of metachronous lesions if a germline mutation is present. Established methods of detecting mismatch repair gene defects require the testing for microsatellite instability. This is expensive and requires specialized molecular biological resources and staff. An immunohistochemical method is attractive because it is far cheaper, and can be performed by most anatomical pathology laboratories. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of mismatch repair gene defects using immunohistochemistry in a group of patients who were aged < or = 45 years at the time of diagnosis of colorectal cancer and to compare the patient survival and pathological features of tumours with and without mismatch repair gene defects.\n\nOne hundred and four patients with colorectal cancer, diagnosed at 45 years or younger between January 1983 and December 2001, who had been managed at Groote Schuur Hospital, were identified from clinical records. Demographic and clinical data was collected from the clinical notes. The pathological reports were reviewed and the original histopathological slides retrieved. New tissue sections were cut from the original paraffin embedded tissue blocks to obtain both normal colonic mucosa and tumour on the same slide. There was insufficient tissue available or poor staining in 11 patients so 93 were available for the study.\n\nThe mismatch repair status was detected by antibodies to hMLH1 and hMSH2 gene product using a standard immunohistochemical technique. Fifty-six (60%) of 93 tumours demonstrated normal expression of both hMLH1 and hMSH2 protein. Twenty-five (27%) tumours did not express hMLH1 and 12 (13%) hMSH2 proteins. Comparison of the histopathological features revealed that a greater proportion of tumours with absence of either the hMLH1 or hMSH2 product were right sided, mucinous and poorly differentiated when compared to those that expressed the gene product. There was no detectable difference in overall survival or in survival of patients with Duke\"s C carcinoma when the groups were separated by the presence or absence of gene product.",
        "To compare the effectiveness of adalimumab monotherapy and adalimumab and methotrexate (MTX) combination therapy in patients with established rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nData from an ongoing longitudinal observational study in Norway were used to compare response to treatment with two different adalimumab regimens (monotherapy, n = 84; combination with MTX, n = 99). Patients were assessed with measures of disease activity, health status and utility scores. Within-group changes were analysed from baseline to follow-up at 3 and 6 months and the changes were compared between groups after adjustment for the propensity score. The groups were also compared for the proportions of patients achieving European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) good response, Disease Activity Score (DAS)28 remission and treatment terminations.\n\nThe improvement from baseline was significant for all measures in the adalimumab and MTX group, but only for DAS28, joint counts, two Short-form Health Survey with 36 questions (SF-36) dimensions and patient\"s and investigator\"s global assessment in the monotherapy group. All between-group differences were numerically in favour of combination therapy and significant for C reactive protein, joint counts, DAS28, Modified Health Assessment Questionnaire, investigator\"s global assessment, four SF-36 dimensions and Short Form 6D at 6 months. More patients in the combination therapy group reached EULAR good response (p<0.001) and remission (p = 0.07). At 6 months, 80.8% of the patients in the combination therapy group and 59.5% in the monotherapy group remained on treatment (p = 0.002). More withdrawals in the monotherapy group were due to adverse events.",
        "The present study examined the effects of indoor exposure to natural bright light on afternoon sleepiness.\n\nParticipants took part in 3 experimental conditions: (1) a natural bright light condition in which they carried out performance and arousal tests sitting near a window (3260.0 +/- 1812.43 lux) from 12:40 PM to 1:10 PM, (2) a nap condition in which they were provided a nap opportunity for 20 minutes from 12:45 PM, and (3) a control condition in which they performed the tests in less than 100 lux surroundings from 12:40 PM to 1:10 PM. Before and after each treatment, the same series of tests were administered.\n\nA temperature- and light-controlled sleep laboratory.\n\nSixteen healthy female paid volunteers aged 33 to 43 (38.1 +/- 2.68) years.\n\nIndoor natural bright light and a short nap.\n\nArousal levels were measured by the Psychomotor Vigilance Task, Alpha Attenuation Test, Karolinska Drowsiness Test, and Karolinska Sleepiness Scale. The tests were repeated every 30 minutes from 11:00 AM to 4:10 PM. Ambient light intensity was maintained at less than 100 lux, except during natural bright light exposure. Short-term exposure to natural bright light significantly improved afternoon arousal levels, as measured by the Karolinska Drowsiness Test and Alpha Attenuation Test, the effects of which continued for at least 60 minutes (1:10-2:10 PM). However, no significant differences were observed between conditions for Psychomotor Vigilance Test performance.",
        "Alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), a pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) derivative, is a neuropeptide with potent anti-inflammatory properties that inhibits tissue injury in a wide array of inflammation models.\n\nTo determine if alpha-MSH is involved in the development of congestive heart failure (CHF) with the specific aim of examining its peripheral source and one of the mechanisms.\n\nThe circulating levels of alpha-MSH were measured in 115 patients with CHF using a double-antibody radioimmunoassay. To determine one of the sources of circulating alpha-MSH, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Furthermore, to clarify one of the functions of alpha-MSH, PBMC were cultured in the presence or absence of alpha-MSH.\n\nPlasma levels of alpha-MSH were significantly higher in NYHA class II patients with CHF than in control subjects (p<0.0001). A significant correlation was found between the levels of alpha-MSH and high-sensitive testing for C-reactive protein in patients with CHF (r=0.41, p<0.0005). PBMC stimulated with LPS or TNF-alpha released alpha-MSH in a concentration-dependent manner. alpha-MSH inhibited LPS-induced TNF-alpha production, and alpha-MSH simultaneously augmented production of interleukin (IL)-10 by PBMC.",
        "The authors identified a patient with mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE), who completely fulfilled the clinical criteria with low thymidine phosphorylase (TP) activity. However, the same homozygotic S471L TP gene mutation was also found in her unaffected mother, but with normal TP activity. To elucidate the pathogenesis of MNGIE, we performed the analysis below.\n\nWe analyzed the TP gene mutation in the proband and 145 unrelated individuals by direct sequence and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). TP activity was determined by the spectrophotometric method for each TP S471L genotype.\n\nAmong 145 normal persons, the S471L homozygote mutants were identified in 2.76% and their enzyme activity was normal.",
        "Treatment for acute ischemic stroke should be administered as soon as possible after symptom onset. The aim of this study was to investigate whether or not the patient\"s and bystander\"s first impression at stroke onset was associated with hospital arrival time.\n\nTo investigate the factors influencing the prehospital delay, we prospectively interviewed consecutive stroke patients and bystanders about their first impression at the stroke onset and assessed the methods of transportation, and clinical characteristics. Early arrival was defined as a hospital arrival of within 2 h from stroke onset.\n\nOne hundred thirty patients were enrolled: 82% were ischemic stroke and 18% were cerebral hemorrhage. The median interval between symptom onset and the hospital arrival was 7.5 h and 30% of patients presented within 2 h of stroke onset. First impression of stroke (odds ratios [OR] 4.56, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.54-13.5, p=0.006), presence of consciousness disturbance (OR 4.29, CI 1.39-13.3, p=0.011), arrival through other facilities (OR 0.25, CI 0.08-0.76, p=0.015), a history of diabetes (OR 0.23, CI 0.06-0.80, p=0.028) and nocturnal onset (OR 0.19, CI 0.04-0.88, p=0.042) independently contributed to the early arrival.",

Mutation analysis was performed using direct PCR amplification and PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis.\n\nWe identified a novel homozygous recessive mutation in the PEPD gene, which was found to segregate in the family of the patient with the disease and was not found in a panel of DNA samples representative of all major Druze families living in northern Israel.",
        "To evaluate cell cultures derived from intrasynovial nodules from a patient with primary synovial chondromatosis (PSC) for aberrant numbers/differentiation of osteochondroprogenitor cells.\n\nCell cultures were established from PSC synovial nodules, or normal bovine or human osteoarthritis (OA) synovia (for comparison). Multi-lineage potential was determined using well-characterized in vitro culture systems to assess osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic capability.\n\nPrimary PSC cell cultures were typically fibroblastic but contained islands of dense cell clusters/nodules, some of which were isolated and cultured separately [putative osteochondroprogenitris (pOCP) cultures]. OA synovial cultures had barely detectable levels of alkaline phosphatase (AP) that increased (0.006+/-0.008 to 0.141+/-0.000 nmol p-nitrophenol/min/cm(2)) with dexamethasone treatment. AP activity was higher in primary PSC cell cultures and further enhanced by dexamethasone (from 0.076+/-0.022 to 5.735+/-0.000 nmol p-nitrophenol/min/cm(2)). Histochemically, AP was localized as discreet areas within PSC cultures. No AP activity was detected histochemically in OA or normal bovine synovial cultures. The pOCP cultures had high basal AP (5.036+/-0.439 nmol p-nitrophenol/min/cm(2)) and spontaneously formed mineralized nodules, which increased in number under standard osteogenic conditions. Under chondrogenic conditions, micromass or pellet-cultured pOCP cells spontaneously synthesized a matrix containing glycosaminoglycans and collagen II. In adipogenic medium, the number of lipid-containing cells was increased.",
        "To determine the expression and regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C), and its receptor VEGFR-3, in human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and to consider their angiogenic role in choroidal neovascularisation (CNV).\n\nThe expression of VEGF-C and VEGFR-3 in cultured human RPE was confirmed by immunostaining, PCR, western blotting, and ELISA. Cultured RPE cells were exposed to VEGF-A and glucose and VEGF-C and VEGFR-3 changes in gene expression determined by RT-PCR. Secreted VEGF-C protein in conditioned media from RPE was examined by western blotting and ELISA analysis. The ability of VEGF-C to elicit tube formation in choroidal endothelial cells was assayed by an in vitro Matrigel model.\n\nVEGF-A and glucose upregulated VEGF-C mRNA expression and increased the secretion of VEGF-C protein into the culture medium. VEGF-A, but not glucose alone, stimulated VEGFR-3 mRNA expression. VEGF-C acted synergistically with VEGF-A to promote in vitro tube formation by choroidal endothelial cells.",
        "Intermittent hypoxia during sleep (IH), as occurs in sleep disordered breathing (SDB), induces spatial learning deficits associated with regulation of transcription factors associated with learning and memory in the hippocampal CA1 region in rats. high fat refined carbohydrate diet (HF/RC) can induce similar deficits and associated changes in signaling pathways under normoxic conditions.\n\nSprague-Dawley adult male rats were fed either with (HF/RC) or low fat/complex carbohydrate diet (LF/CC) starting at post-natal day 30 for 90 days, and were then exposed for 14 days during light phase (12 h/day) to either normoxia (RA) or IH (21% and 10% O2 alternations every 90 s). Place-training reference memory task deficits were assessed in the Morris water maze. Total and ser-133 phosphorylated CREB were assessed in different brain regions by Western blotting and immunostaining in rats exposed to normoxia or IH and to LF/CC or HF/RC.\n\nSubstantial decreases in CREB phosphorylation occurred in CA1 but not in motor cortex following either IH, HF/RC, and HF/RC + IH.

        "Familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCH) is characterized by several phenotypes, including an atherogenic lipoprotein profile, low grade inflammation, visceral obesity, insulin resistance, and hypertension. In this study, we investigated which of the clinical and biochemical characteristics of FCH patients contributes most to their increased risk of cardiovascular disease, by determining the association of a broad variety cardiovascular risk factors with the intima media thickness (IMT) of the common carotid artery (CCA) in 94 FCH patients and 216 non-affected relatives.\n\nAll subjects filled out a questionnaire about their smoking and drinking habits, medical history and medication use, and venous blood was drawn in the fasting state after discontinuation of lipid lowering medication (if used). IMT of the far wall and near wall of both CCAs was measured by high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography.\n\nThe mean IMT in FCH patients (adjusted for age and gender) was 33 microm thicker when compared to their non-affected relatives (p=0.006). In multivariate analysis, the waist-to-hip ratio, the apoB concentration and the pulse pressure were significant and independent predictors of IMT in both FCH patients and their normolipidemic relatives. The most important independent predictor of IMT in FCH patients however, was the VLDL-c/TG ratio, explaining 32.8% of the variation in age- and gender-adjusted IMT, whereas this ratio was not an independent predictor of IMT at all in their unaffected relatives.",
        "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is important for pancreatic beta cell development and function. Common variation in the VEGF gene is associated with altered serum concentrations of VEGF and with several diseases, but its role in type 2 diabetes is not known. The single nucleotide polymorphisms C-2578A (rs699947), G-1154A (rs1570360) and G-634C (rs2010963) in the 5\"-region of VEGF are associated with altered serum concentrations of the protein.\n\nWe performed a large case-control and family-based study to test the hypothesis that these variants are associated with type 2 diabetes in a UK Caucasian population.\n\nWe genotyped 1,969 cases, 1,625 controls and 530 families for the three single nucleotide polymorphisms.\n\nAllele and genotype frequencies were compared between cases and controls. Family-based analysis was used to test for over- or under-transmission of alleles to affected offspring.\n\nDespite good power (80%) to detect odds ratios of approximately 1.2, there were no significant associations between single alleles or genotypes and type 2 diabetes. Odds ratios (and 95% confidence intervals) comparing case and control allele frequencies for single nucleotide polymorphisms C-2578A, G-1154A and G-634C were 0.97 (0.88-1.07), 0.99 (0.90-1.09) and 0.97 (0.88-1.08), respectively.",
        "This study was designed to determine how important a novel risk factor of elevated blood pressure variability (BPV) is in the determination of end-organ damage by comparison with the classic risk factor of a high blood pressure (BP) level.\n\nThe effects of haemodynamics on cardiovascular morphology were evaluated by univariate and multivariate regression analysis in two different rat models with an enlarged distribution of haemodynamics. In male sham-operated and sinoaortic-denervated Wistar-Kyoto rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (n = 34), BPV was more important than BP in cardiac and renal damage and aortic hypertrophy. BPV and BP had independent effects, explaining 59.4% of the variation in damage to these organs. In male (n = 44) and female (n = 46) F1 hybrids of Sprague-Dawley rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats, the greater importance of BPV than BP was further demonstrated in left ventricular hypertrophy, glomerular damage and aortic hypertrophy. The phenomenon was more evident in females than males for cardiovascular hypertrophy. BPV and BP or BPV alone had independent effects, explaining 46.9% (male) or 37.5% (female) of the variation in damage to these organs.",
        "In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that selected strains of probiotic bacteria can form tight complexes with aflatoxin B(1) and other carcinogens.\n\nThe aim of the present study was to determine whether administration of probiotic bacteria could block the intestinal absorption of aflatoxin B(1) and thereby lead to reduced urinary excretion of aflatoxin B(1)-N(7)-guanine (AFB-N(7)-guanine), a marker for a biologically effective dose of aflatoxin exposure. Elevated urinary excretion of this aflatoxin-DNA adduct is associated with an increased risk of liver cancer.\n\nNinety healthy young men from Guangzhou, China, were randomly assigned to 2 groups; one group received a mixture of Lactobacillus rhamnosus LC705 and Propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii strains 2 times/d for 5 wk, and the other group received a placebo preparation. The subjects provided 4 urine samples: at baseline, at 3 and 5 wk after starting the supplementation, and at the end of the 5-wk postintervention period.\n\nThe percentage of samples with negative AFB-N(7)-guanine values tended to be higher in the probiotic group than in the placebo group during the 5-wk intervention period (odds ratio: 2.63, P = 0.052), and a statistically significant decrease in the concentration of urinary AFB-N(7)-guanine was observed in the probiotic group. The reduction was 36% at week 3 and 55% at week 5.

        "Authors from the USA sought to establish the relationship between tumour volume, pathological stage and outcomes after radical prostatectomy. In a large series of patients they found that tumour volume was correlated directly with pathological stage, and that it was independently correlated with PSA recurrence. The authors suggested that tumour volume had a potential use for prognostication in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. Two papers, one from the USA and one from Germany, advise a re-staging TUR in patients with superficial bladder cancer who are at high risk of early tumour progression. In a large series of patients they found that residual tumour after initial resection was commoner than might be expected, and that the second resection indicated the way to earlier radical treatment and a better prognosis.\n\nTo establish the relationship between tumour volume (TV), pathological stage and outcome after radical prostatectomy (RP), as TV is theoretically an important variable in prostate cancer pathology, but to date it has not been routinely reported and its independent prognostic significance is not well defined.\n\nThe study included 431 consecutive patients undergoing RP for clinically localized cancer, from January 2000 to January 2002, who had a pathological examination of totally submitted whole-mount processed RP specimens. In addition to Gleason grade, tumour stage and margin assessment by standard techniques, TV was determined by digital planimetry. The total TV or index TV, for cases with obvious discrete separate tumours, were correlated with pathological stage and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence.\n\nThe mean (range) follow-up was 25.4 (6-51) months, and the mean TV for all patients was 3.28 (0.4-38.8) mL. There was a direct correlation between TV and pathological stage (P < 0.001). The TV for organ-confined and extraprostatic disease was 2.09 and 6.02 mL, respectively (P < 0.001). In a multivariate analysis, TV was an independent predictor of PSA recurrence (P = 0.04). The mean TV for patients with PSA recurrence vs no recurrence was 6.8 and 2.6 mL, respectively (P < 0.001).",
        "Cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2) and prostaglandins regulate angiogenesis in several settings, including cancer and ischemia. In the eye, both selective inhibitors of COX-2 and nonselective COX inhibitors are reported to suppress ischemia-related retinal angiogenesis. Such studies however, may be confounded by the nonspecific effects of inhibitors.\n\nMice lacking either the COX-1 (COX-1(-/-)) or COX-2 isoform (COX-2(-/-)) were employed in a model of oxygen-induced retinopathy. Vascular responses were examined by histology, isolectin B4 staining of the abluminal endothelium, and retinal fluorescein angiography.\n\nThere was an increase in intravitreal endothelial nuclei in hyperoxia-treated mice compared to normoxic controls irrespective of the genotype. Quantitative analysis of fluorescein-perfused and isolectin B4-stained retinal angiograms at postnatal day 18 (P18) revealed similar global levels of neovascular tufts in hyperoxia-treated wild-type, COX-1(-/-), and COX-2(-/-) mice. However, hyperoxia-treated COX-2(-/-) mice had increased areas of retinal nonperfusion (29.2+/-1.9 compared to 16.3+/-2.7; n=6; p<0.001). COX-1 disruption had no effect (15.6+/-2.6; n=8). Platelet deposition within retinal vessels was increased in hyperoxia-treated COX-2(-/-) mice (p<0.05).",
        "Tolerance can cause a decrease in drug efficacy during chronic therapy, possibly leading to treatment failures.\n\nThe aim of this article is to determine whether tolerance developed to the effects of tadalafil on erectile function (EF) over a 6-month treatment period.\n\nPost hoc analysis of data from a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group study was performed. Men (> or =18 years of age) with erectile dysfunction (ED) were randomized to treatment with placebo (N = 47) or 20-mg tadalafil (N = 93) taken as needed for 6 months. This report focuses on efficacy assessed with the Sexual Encounter Profile (SEP) diary (diaries were collected after a 4-week treatment-free run-in period [baseline], and monthly for 6 months), and with the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) (administered at baseline, and at 3 and 6 months). RESULTS. The mean per-patient percentage \"yes\" response on SEP question 3 (SEP3, successful intercourse) was 33 +/- 4% at baseline, 74 +/- 4% after 1 month, and 78 +/- 4% after 6 months of tadalafil treatment. The IIEF EF domain score was 16.2 +/- 0.7 at baseline, 24.3 +/- 0.8 after 3 months, and 24.3 +/- 0.9 after 6 months of tadalafil treatment. In a subgroup of patients who took tadalafil > or =3 times per week (N = 24), the SEP3 score was 87 +/- 4% after 1 month and 93 +/- 3% after 6 months of treatment, and the IIEF EF domain score was 27.3 +/- 0.9 after 3 months and 28.5 +/- 0.4 after 6 months. Of 16 tadalafil-treated patients who discontinued, three cited a lack of efficacy.",
        "To evaluate the role of cigarette smoke exposure (CSE) on ventricular remodeling following acute myocardial infarction (AMI).\n\nRats were submitted to myocardial infarction and divided into two groups: C (control, n = 31) and F (CSE: 40 cigarettes/day, n = 22). After 6 months, the survivors were submitted to echocardiogram, functional study with isolated heart, and morphometric analysis. For comparison purposes, we used the t test (mean +/- standard deviation) or the Mann-Whitney test (with median and 25th and 75th percentiles).\n\nThe CSE animals tended to have larger diastolic (C = 1.5 +/- 0.4 mm2, F = 1.9 +/- 0.4 mm2; p = 0.08) and systolic (C = 1.05 +/- 0.3 mm2, F = 1.32 +/- 0.4 mm2; p = 0.08) left ventricular(LV) areas. The systolic function of the LV, assessed according to the fractional area change, tended to be impaired in CSE animals (C = 31.9 +/- 9.3%, F = 25.5 +/- 7.6%; p = 0.08). The dp/dt values for CSE animals were statistically lower (C = 1474 +/- 397 mmHg, F = 916 +/- 261 mmHg; p = 0.02) than for control animals. The CSE animals presented higher right ventricle (RV) weight adjusted for body weight (C = 0.8 +/- 0.3 mg/g, F = 1.3 +/- 0.4 mg/g; p = 0.01), higher content of water in lungs (C = 4.8 (4.3-4.8)%, F = 5.4 (5.1-5.5); p = 0.03), and larger LV myocyte cross-sectional areas (C = 239.8 +/- 5.8 microm2, F = 253.9 +/- 7.9 microm2; p = 0.01).",
        "Early identification of patients who develop severe acute pancreatitis and those who can benefit from intensive care is important. We studied whether procalcitonin, a marker of systemic inflammation, is important in the differential diagnosis of patients with mild and severe acute pancreatitis.\n\nPatients were divided into two groups (mild and severe form) prospectively. Procalcitonin levels and the Ranson\"s and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores were determined both at admission and during the follow-up.\n\nOf the 65 patients with acute pancreatitis, 46 had mild and 19 had severe pancreatitis. Sensitivity and specificity values for patients calculated using procalcitonin level at 0.5 ng/ml, Ranson\"s score at 3 and APACHE II score at 8 cut-off levels, were 100%, 84% and 89%; and 84%, 63% and 89% respectively.",

These are both quantitative and qualitative.",
        "For over 50 years, Q-wave myocardial infarction (MI) location has been based on pathologic ECG studies. Although contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (CE-CMR) is currently the \"gold standard\" technique for location and quantification of necrotic areas, we found no large study in the literature devoted to establish which ECG patterns corresponds to different MI location detected by CE-CMR. We hypothesized that CE-CMR would be very accurate for evaluating different ECG patterns and its sensitivity (SE) and specificity (SP) for locating MI in different LV areas.\n\nCE-CMR/ECG correlation was studied in 48 patients who presented a first MI due to acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with ST-segment elevation and in whom CE-CMR was performed in chronic phase. We evaluated the ECG patterns that best correlated with the 7 prespecified necrotic areas assessed by CE-CMR, 4 in anteroseptal zone (septal, apical/anteroseptal, extensive anterior, and limited anterolateral) and 3 in inferolateral zone (inferior, lateral and inferolateral). The global concordance between CE-CRM and ECG was of 75% and 7 ECG patterns were stablished.",
        "The Constant Load Treadmill Test (CLTT) is currently the primary method used to measure walking impairment in patients with peripheral vascular disease. The aim of this study was to compare the CLTT and PADHOC device as assessments of walking impairment.\n\n55 patients with intermittent claudication underwent a CLTT and a Double Physiological Walking Test (DPWT) using the PADHOC device. Health-related quality of life was measured using the Short Form 36 and the Claudication Scale.\n\nThe initial claudication and maximum walking distance from the first part of the DPWT showed the best correlation with domains of pain and physical function.",
        "Pro-inflammatory cytokines play an important role in osteoarthritis (OA). In osteoarthritic cartilage, chondrocytes exhibit an alteration in mitochondrial activity. This study analyzes the effect of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) on the mitochondrial activity of normal human chondrocytes.\n\nMitochondrial function was evaluated by analyzing the activities of respiratory chain enzyme complexes and citrate synthase, as well as by mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis. Bcl-2 family mRNA expression and protein synthesis were analyzed by RNase protection assay (RPA) and Western-blot, respectively. Cell viability was analyzed by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and apoptosis by 4\n\n,        \"Compared to basal cells, stimulation with TNFalpha (10 ng/ml) and IL-1beta (5 ng/ml) for 48 h significantly decreased the activity of complex I (TNFalpha=35% and IL-1beta=35%) and the production of ATP (TNFalpha=18% and IL-1beta=19%). Both TNFalpha and IL-1beta caused a definitive time-dependent decrease in the red/green fluorescence ratio in chondrocytes, indicating depolarization of the mitochondria. Both cytokines induced mRNA expression and protein synthesis of the Bcl-2 family. Rotenone, an inhibitor of complex I, caused a significant reduction of the red/green ratio, but it did not reduce the viability of the chondrocytes. Rotenone also increased Bcl-2 mRNA expression and protein synthesis. Finally, rotenone as well as TNFalpha and IL-1beta, reduced the content of proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix of normal cartilage.",
        "We examined correlates of deliberate sexual abstinence among gay/bisexual men, heterosexual men, and women in a national probability sample of adults with HIV.\n\nParticipants in the HIV Cost and Services Utilization Study (HCSUS; n=1339) answered questions about oral, anal, or vaginal sexual intercourse in the past 6 months; those who reported none of these behaviors (n=415) were asked about their reasons for abstinence. Of these, 201 participants (11% of gay/bisexual men, 18% of women, 18% of heterosexual men) indicated that their abstinence was deliberate. Multivariate models were used to predict deliberate abstinence.\n\nIn multivariate analyses, not having a primary relationship partner/spouse was a significant correlate of deliberate abstinence for all 3 groups. Higher perceived responsibility for limiting disease transmission and nondrinking status were related to deliberate abstinence only among gay/bisexual men. Worse health was associated with deliberate abstinence only among heterosexual men.",
        "Grapefruit juice (GFJ) enhances the systemic exposure of numerous CYP3A4 drug substrates, including felodipine, by inhibiting intestinal (but not hepatic) first-pass metabolism. Furanocoumarins have been identified as major CYP3A4 inhibitors contained in the juice, but their contribution to the GFJ effect in vivo remains unclear.\n\nTo ascertain whether furanocoumarins mediate the GFJ-felodipine interaction, a furanocoumarin-free GFJ was created and tested against orange juice and the original GFJ with respect to the oral pharmacokinetics of felodipine.\n\nWith the use of food-grade solvents and absorption resins, furanocoumarins were removed (approximately 99%) from whole GFJ, whereas other major ingredients (flavonoids) were retained. In an open, 3-way, randomized crossover design, 18 healthy volunteers ingested felodipine (10 mg) with 1 of the 3 juices (240 mL). Blood was collected over 24 h. At least 1 wk elapsed between juice treatments.\n\nThe median and range of the area under the curve and the maximum concentration of felodipine were significantly (P < 0.001) greater with consumption of GFJ [110 (range: 58-270) nmol . h/L and 21 (7.6-50) nmol/L, respectively] than with that of orange juice [54 (29-150) nmol . h/L and 7.6 (3.4-13.9) nmol/L, respectively] or furanocoumarin-free GFJ [48 (23-120) nmol . h/L and 8.3 (3.0-16.6) nmol/L, respectively]. GFJ, orange juice, and furanocoumarin-free GFJ did not differ significantly (P > 0.09) in median time to reach maximum plasma concentration [2.5 (1.5-6), 2.8 (1.5-4), and 2.5 (2-6) h, respectively] or terminal half-life [6.6 (4.2-13.6), 7.8 (4.4-13.2), and 6.8 (2.6-14.4) h, respectively].",
        "Adolescents are nutritionally at risk because of their physiologic needs and dietary habits. Maillard reaction products (MRPs) are widely consumed by this population, mainly as a result of their high intake of fast food and snacks.\n\nWe compared the effects of diets with different MRP contents on dietary protein utilization in adolescent males aged 11-14 y. The brown diet (BD) was rich and the white diet (WD) was poor in MRP content (hydroxymethylfurfural: 3.87 and 0.94 mg/kg; fluorescence intensity: 21.04% and 7.31%, respectively).\n\nIn a 2-period crossover trial, 18 healthy adolescent males were randomly assigned to 2 groups. The first group consumed the WD for 2 wk, observed a 40-d washout period, and then consumed the BD for 2 wk. The second group received the diets in the opposite order. Subjects collected urine and feces on the last 3 d of each dietary period. Fasting blood samples were collected after both periods.\n\nCompared with consumption of the WD, consumption of the BD resulted in 47% higher fecal nitrogen fecal excretion (P = 0.002), 12% lower apparent nitrogen absorption (P = 0.000), and a 6% lower nitrogen digestibility (P = 0.000). The apparent nitrogen retention and the utilization of ingested nitrogen did not differ significantly between the diets, although values after the BD tended to decrease. Serum biochemical variables related to nitrogen metabolism did not differ significantly.",
        "The immune system may be compromised after menopause because of the effects of aging and diminishing concentrations of estrogen, an immune-modulating hormone. Isoflavones, plant-derived compounds with estrogenic and antioxidant properties, may offer immunologic benefits to women during this stage of life.\n\nThe objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of soy isoflavones, both in soymilk and in supplement form, on markers of immunity and oxidative stress in postmenopausal women.\n\nPostmenopausal women aged 50-65 y (n = 52) enrolled in this 16-wk double-blind, placebo-controlled trial were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 experimental groups: 1) control, 706 mL cow milk/d plus a placebo supplement; 2) soymilk, 71.6 mg isoflavones derived from 706 mL soymilk/d plus a placebo supplement; and 3) supplement, 70 mg isoflavones in a supplement plus 706 mL cow milk/d. Plasma and 24-h urine samples were obtained at baseline and at 16 wk. Immune variables included lymphocyte subsets, cytokine production, and markers of inflammation and oxidative damage.\n\nIsoflavone intervention in postmenopausal women resulted in higher (P < 0.05) B cell populations and lower (P < 0.05) plasma concentrations of 8-hydroxy-2-deoxy-guanosine, an oxidative marker of DNA damage. Isoflavone treatment did not significantly influence concentrations of interferon gamma, interleukin 2, tumor necrosis factor alpha, or C-reactive protein in plasma or of 8-isoprostane in urine.",
        "Abutment screw loosening, especially in the case of cemented single tooth restorations, is a cause of implant restoration failure. This study compared three screws (titanium alloy, gold alloy, and gold-coated) with similar geometry by recording the preload induced when torques of 10, 20, and 35 Ncm were used for fixation.\n\nTwo abutment types were used-prefabricated preparable abutments and cast-on abutments. A custom-designed rig was used to measure preload in the abutment-screw-implant assembly with a strain gauge. Ten screws of each type were sequentially tightened to 10, 20, and 35 Ncm on ten of the two abutment types. The same screws were then loosened and re-tightened. This procedure was repeated. Thus, each screw was tightened on three occasions to the three insertion torques. A linear regression model was used to analyze the effects on preload values of screw type and abutment type for each of the three insertion torques.\n\nThe results indicated that the gold-coated screw generated the highest preloads for all insertion torques and for each tightening episode. Further analysis focused on the effects of screw type and abutment type for each episode of tightening and for each fixation torque. The gold-coated screw, fixed to the prefabricated abutment, displayed higher preloads for the first tightening at 10, 20, and 35 Ncm. Conversely, the same screw fixed to the cast-on abutment showed higher values for the second and third tightening for all fixation torques. All screws showed decay in preload with the number of times tightened. Given the higher preloads generated using the gold-coated screw with both abutment types, it is more likely that this type of screw will maintain a secure joint when tightened for the second and third time.",
        "Currently available clinical and molecular factors provide still an insufficient prognostic and predictive assessment for patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). To identify a potential molecular target and prognostic/predictive factor for EOC, we investigated in a retrospective study the prognostic value of Ep-CAM overexpression in EOC.\n\nWe assessed by immunohistochemistry the expression of the Ep-CAM antigen on tissue microarrays containing paraffin-embedded tissue samples of 199 patients with documented EOC. Patients were operated for ovarian cancer in the period between June 1980 and January 2000.\n\nWe observed a rate of Ep-CAM overexpression of 68.8%. Ep-CAM overexpression was significantly related to a decreased overall survival (P = 0.036). The prognostic power of Ep-CAM overexpression was particularly strong in patients with stage III and IV disease. In fact, in this subgroup, median overall survival was twofold higher in patients without as compared to patients with Ep-CAM overexpression (46 vs. 23 months, P < 0.01). Univariate analysis revealed a correlation with histologic grade. We observed a significantly higher rate of Ep-CAM overexpression (83.5%) in grade 3 tumors. Histologic subtypes associated with a higher rate of Ep-CAM overexpression were serous carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, clear cell carcinoma, and endometrioid carcinoma. Cox regression analysis showed Ep-CAM overexpression to be an independent prognostic marker (P = 0.037, RR = 1.64).",
        "Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) elicits a wide range of pro-inflammatory activities on target cells and mediates diverse cardiovascular processes ranging from heart failure to atherosclerosis. Recently, we demonstrated that TNF-alpha regulates the platelelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-A/PDGF-Ralpha activation pathway in rat cardiac allograft arteriosclerosis. The aim of this study was to determine the kinetics and biologic role of TNF-alpha and its receptors, TNF-R1 and TNF-R2, in rat cardiac allografts.\n\nHeterotopic heart transplantations were performed from Dark Agouti to Wistar-Furth rats. In the acute rejection model, recipients were given no immunosuppression and grafts were removed 5 days after transplantation. In the chronic rejection model, cyclosporine (CsA) was administered and grafts were removed at 60 days. To investigate the functional role of TNF-alpha in chronic rejection, recipients received recombinant human soluble TNF receptor p80/IgG1 Fc fusion protein (rhu TNF-R2:Fc).\n\nDuring acute and chronic rejection, an increase in intragraft TNF-alpha and TNF-R2 mRNA expression was recorded, but not TNF-R1 mRNA expression. Prominent induction of TNF-alpha and TNF-R2 immunoreactivity was localized to medial cells of coronary arteries and interstitial inflammatory cells, whereas cardiomyocytes showed moderate immunoreactivity to TNF-alpha and its receptors. Inhibition of the TNF-alpha-mediated pathway by TNF-R2:Fc did not affect the incidence or intensity of arteriosclerotic lesions in rat cardiac allografts; however, it significantly inhibited myocardial remodeling with a concomitant decrease in myocardial TNF-alpha expression but not intragraft PDGF immunoreactivity.",
        "Cyclosporine (CsA) level at 2 hours post-dose (C2) is a more sensitive marker for rejection risk than trough (C0) level. A combination of C2 and C0 monitoring may prove optimal.\n\nWe compared efficacy and safety outcomes among 28 de novo heart transplant patients in whom both C2 and C0 monitoring were undertaken (Group 1), with a single CsA profile at Weeks 2 to 6, versus 28 historic controls monitored by only C0 (Group 2). Patients received anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) induction with CsA, steroids and azathioprine maintenance therapy.\n\nThe CsA microemulsion dose was significantly higher in Group 1 than Group 2 up to 3 months post-transplant. Mean C2 values in Group 1 at 3 and 12 months were 1,248 +/- 328 ng/ml and 1,039 +/- 362 ng/ml, respectively. One patient in Group 1 and 7 in Group 2 (25%) discontinued CsA, either due to CsA-related neurotoxicity or two or more episodes of early rejection. At 12 months, graft and patient survival were 100% in both groups. Six patients in Group 1 (21%) and 11 in Group 2 (39%) had at least one episode of biopsy-proven acute rejection (not significant). Over the first 12 months post-transplant, the proportion of biopsies showing Grade 3 rejection was 5% in Group 1 and 11% in Group 2 (p < 0.002). Gloerular filtration rate (GFR) was significantly lower in Group 1 than Group 2 at both 3 and 12 months.",
        "The optimal management of cholelithiasis after heart transplant remains unclear. We use expectant management based on symptoms, without screening studies or prophylactic treatment. We hypothesized that expectant management for cholelithiasis after heart transplant does not result in significant mortality or morbidity from gallstone-associated disease.\n\nBetween November 1985 and August 2004, 409 heart transplants were performed in 402 recipients at the University of Washington. This is a non-concurrent cohort study of these recipients.\n\nAmong recipients, 24 underwent cholecystectomy before heart transplant. After transplant, in the remaining 378 patients, 34 were found to have gallstones during the observation period. There was no mortality from gallstone-associated disease. Thirty patients developed morbidity from gallstones, including 25 cases of biliary colic, 3 of acute cholecystitis and 2 of pancreatitis, and there was 1 abnormal liver function test. Acute cholecystitis and pancreatitis were treated with conservative management followed by cholecystectomy. Cholecystectomy was performed in 32 patients after transplant. Indications included symptomatic cholelithiasis in 31, and prophylactic cholecystectomy prior to kidney transplant in 1. The laparoscopic approach was performed in 25 of these 32 patients. There was no mortality from cholecystectomy, but there were 4 complications: surgical site infections (n = 2); wound dehiscence (n = 1); and bile duct injury (n = 1). Median hospital stay was 1 day.",
        "Patient global ratings of care are commonly used to assess health care. However, the extent to which these assessments of care are related to the technical quality of care received is not well understood.\n\nTo investigate the relationship between patient-reported global ratings of health care and the quality of providers\" communication and technical quality of care.\n\nObservational cohort study.\n\n2 managed care organizations.\n\nVulnerable older patients identified by brief interviews of a random sample of community-dwelling adults 65 years of age or older who received care in 2 managed care organizations during a 13-month period.\n\nSurvey questions from the second stage of the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems program were used to determine patients\" global rating of health care and provider communication. A set of 236 quality indicators, defined by the Assessing Care of Vulnerable Elders project, were used to measure technical quality of care given for 22 clinical conditions; 207 quality indicators were evaluated by using data from chart abstraction or patient interview.\n\nData on the global rating item, communication scale, and technical quality of care score were available for 236 vulnerable older patients. In a multivariate logistic regression model that included patient and clinical factors, better communication was associated with higher global ratings of health care. Technical quality of care was not significantly associated with the global rating of care.",
        "Some patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) have large myocardial infarction but others have small or no infarction. However, what makes this difference has not been clarified. We compared the angioscopic findings between those two categories of ACS patients and examined the association between the severity of ACS and the morphology of both culprit lesion and nonculprit coronary segments.\n\nProspectively and consecutively enrolled patients with ACS were classified as CK-elevation-ACS (CKE-ACS; n = 54) or non-CK-elevation-ACS (NCKE-ACS; n = 22). Patients were diagnosed as CKE-ACS when the elevation (greater than twice the normal upper limit) of CK-MB was detected; otherwise, patients were diagnosed as NCKE-ACS. They all underwent emergent catheterization and PCI of the culprit lesion. The entire culprit artery was observed by angioscopy, and the prevalence of thrombus and the color grade of yellow plaques were evaluated. The color grade of yellow plaques were classified as 0 (white), 1 (slight yellow), 2 (yellow), or 3 (intense yellow) according to the standard colors. The color grade of culprit plaque (CC), number (NP) and maximum (MC) color grade of yellow plaques in the nonculprit segments, plaque index (PI = N x MC), and prevalence of thrombus at the culprit lesion (CT) and in the nonculprit segments (NT) were compared between CKE-ACS and NCKE-ACS patients.\n\nCC (1.9 +/- 0.9 vs. 1.7 +/- 0.8; p = 0.3) and CT (93% vs. 77%; p = 0.06) were not significantly different between CKE-ACS and NCKE-ACS patients, however, NP (2.2 +/- 1.6 vs. 1.4 +/- 1.2; p = 0.03), MC (1.8 +/- 0.9 vs. 1.2 +/- 0.9; p = 0.008), PI (4.8 +/- 4.4 vs. 2.4 +/- 3.1; p = 0.03), and NT (39% vs. 11%; p = 0.02) were significantly higher in CKE-ACS than in NCKE-ACS patients.",
        "To explore the life satisfaction of patients with erectile dysfunction (ED) and to examine the relation between severity of ED and life satisfaction.\n\nThe study sample was recruited from patients who presented in an andrologic outpatient clinic complaining of ED. All patients underwent the basic clinical evaluation and were assessed by the International Index of Erectile Dysfunction (IIEF) and the Life Satisfaction Inventory (LSI).\n\nThe study included 69 patients with ED (age range 22-71 years, mean 49.5, SD 13.7). The LSI appeared to have satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach\"s alpha = 0.82). Men with ED had significantly lower satisfaction with their sexual life (t = -13.756, d.f. = 68, P = 0.000), but also significantly lower total score of satisfaction with their life (t = -2.793, d.f. = 68, P = 0.007) compared with available normative data from healthy population. However, when compared with controls, men with ED showed significantly higher satisfaction scores on their financial status (t = 5.075, d.f. = 68, P = 0.000) and on their leisure time activities (t = 4.029, d.f. = 68, P = 0.000). Regarding ED severity, mild ED affects patients\" satisfaction with sexual life less than do moderate and severe ED.

        "There is intense interest in the interaction between microbial compounds and allergy. Although Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 ligands derived from Gram-positive bacteria alter allergic sensitization in animal models, it is not clear what effect TLR2 ligands have on allergen-specific T-cell memory in human beings.\n\nTo determine whether in vitro exposure to TLR2 ligands modifies the immune response to house dust mite allergen (HDM).\n\nBlood mononuclear cells were obtained from individuals both allergic (n = 23) and not allergic (n = 22) to HDM, and stimulated with HDM in the presence or absence of TLR2 ligands.\n\nIn subjects allergic to HDM, IL-5 and IL-13 responses to HDM were inhibited by heat-killed Staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcal lipoteichoic acid, and the synthetic lipoprotein Pam3CSK4 (P < .005; all stimuli). Although the whole staphylococcal bacteria increased IFN-gamma responses, the purified TLR2 ligands lipoteichoic acid and Pam3CSK4 inhibited HDM-specific IFN-gamma synthesis. In contrast, TLR2 ligands had minimal effects on responses to HDM in subjects without allergy. TLR2 ligands induced upregulation of HLA-DR expression but did not inhibit antigen uptake or processing by antigen-presenting cells.",
        "Dendritic cells (DCs) acquire, during their maturation, the expression of the chemokine receptor CCR7 and the ability to migrate to lymph nodes in response to CC chemokine ligand 19 (CCL19). This migration is impaired in mice lacking the leukotriene (LT) C4 transporter and restored by addition of exogenous LTC4.\n\nTo define the role of LT in human DC function, we studied the expression and function of the cysteinyl-leukotriene (CysLT) receptors during DC differentiation from monocytes and subsequent maturation.\n\nReceptor expression was measured by flow cytometry and real-time PCR. Responsiveness to LTD4 stimulation was assessed by calcium flux and chemotaxis.\n\nMaturation of DC with LPS, a classic Toll-like receptor 4 agonist, reduced CysLT receptor 1 (CysLT1) expression by 50%, whereas CysLT receptor 2 expression was increased. In contrast, the Toll-like receptor 3 agonist poly inosinic and cytidylic acid (polyI:C) had no effect on receptor expression. Downregulation of CysLT1 expression by LPS could not be mimicked by TNF-alpha alone or in combination with IL-1beta or IL-6. It was, however, prevented by inhibitors of COX and could be reproduced by a combination of TNF-alpha and prostaglandin E2. Immature DCs and DCs matured with polyI:C, but not with LPS, responded to LTD4 with a robust cytosolic calcium flux, which was prevented by the CysLT1 antagonist montelukast. LTD4 induced DC chemotaxis and enhanced DC migration in response to CCL19 in DCs matured with polyI:C, but only weakly in DCs matured with LPS.",
        "The induction of tolerance may be a promising target of strategies aimed at preventing harmful allergic diseases. Low zone tolerance (LZT), induced by epicutaneous application of low doses of contact allergens, inhibits the development of T(C)1-mediated contact hypersensitivity (CHS).\n\nWe evaluated the effect of systemic (oral, intravenous) administration of low amounts of haptens on specific immune reactions and tolerance induction.\n\nBy using the mouse model of LZT, we analyzed immune reactions in vivo (skin inflammation) and T-cell responses in vitro after oral, intravenous, or epicutaneous application of low amounts of the contact allergen 2,4,6-trinitro-1-chlorobenzene (TNCB).\n\nSubimmunogenic doses of TNCB applied orally and intravenously induced a significant tolerance reaction in vivo comparable to epicutaneously tolerized mice, indicating that LZT is a systemically mediated tolerance reaction. In vitro analysis in all models of LZT revealed the generation of IL-10 secreting, regulatory CD4+ T cells that were absolutely required for the development of hapten-specific CD8+ T(C)2 cells. Adoptive transfer experiments identified CD8+ T(C)2 cells as effector T cells of LZT inhibiting the development of CHS-promoting T(C)1 cells and consequently the manifestation of CHS. These suppressor CD8+ T(C)2 cells were found as well in skin-draining as in mesenteric lymph nodes and in the spleen of tolerized animals independent of the route of tolerization.",
        "Based on the findings that erythropoietin (EPO) has been proved to be a multiple functional cytokine to attenuate ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury in various organs such as brain, heart, and kidney in animals, this experiment was designed to evaluate the effect of pretreatment with recombined human erythropoietin (rhEPO) on I/R-induced lung injury.\n\nLeft lungs of rats underwent 90 min of ischemia and then were reperfused for up to 2 h. Animals were randomly divided into three experimental groups as sham group, I/R group, and rhEPO + I/R group (a single dose of rhEPO was injected intraperitoneally 3000 U/kg 24 h prior to operation). Lung injury was evaluated according to semi-quantitative analysis of microscopic changes, tissue polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) accumulation (myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity), and pulmonary microvascular permeability (Evan\"s blue dying method). Peripheral arterial and venous blood samples were obtained for blood-gas analysis after 5 min occlusion of right lung hilus at the end of reperfusion. The serum concentration of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha was also measured by the method of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\n\nHistological injury scoring revealed significantly lessened lung alveolus edema and neutrophils infiltration in the rhEPO pretreated group compared with I/R group (p < 0.05). The rhEPO pretreated animals exhibited markedly decreased lung microvascular permeability (p < 0.05) and myeloperoxidase activity (p < 0.05). Blood-gas analysis demonstrated that the pretreated animals had significantly ameliorated pulmonary oxygenation function (p < 0.05). The serum concentration of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in rhEPO pretreated group was markedly decreased compared with that of I/R group (p < 0.05).",
        "The integrity of junctional epithelium (JE) and a firm epithelial adhesion to the tooth surface are maintained by the balance between cell proliferation and cell death. Maintaining the JE structure is essential for the protection of periodontal connective tissues against oral microbes. In this study, the proliferative activity and the expression of caspase 3, a cysteine protease associated with cell death, were studied in rat JE and other epithelial structures during molar tooth development.\n\nFourteen rats aged 10 to 70 days were injected with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). Samples of first and second molars were selected for immunohistochemical staining. BrdU incorporation was studied in oral epithelium (OE) covering the erupting tooth, reduced enamel epithelium (REE), and gingival epithelium (GE), sulcular epithelium (SE), and JE. Samples were also subjected to immunohistochemical analysis for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and caspase 3.\n\nThe basal cells of the GE were actively proliferating, but in the JE, only a few cells were positive for BrdU or PCNA immunostaining. Some outer REE cells were proliferating during tooth eruption. Caspase 3 expression was in specific areas of REE after completion of amelogenesis.",
        "Hemorrhage increases adhesion of leukocytes to the venular endothelium, mediated by increased expression of the Mac-1 integrin complex (CD18/CD11b) present on leukocytes. Anesthetic agents may possess anti-inflammatory properties. Hence, this study determined the effects of i.v. anesthesia on leukocyte adhesion after hemorrhage in relation to expression of CD11b.\n\nMale Wistar rats were (n = 57) anesthetized i.v. with propofol (Diprivan) and fentanyl, ketamine, or thiopental. During anesthesia, 10% of total blood volume was removed and intravital microscopy used to observe the rat mesentery and measure leukocyte (neutrophils) rolling and adhesion in postcapillary venules (15 - 25 microm). Flow cytometry was also used to determine CD11b expression on neutrophils from blood removed at the end of these experiments (n = 25) or blood incubated with anesthetic agents and activated with platelet activating factor ex vivo (0.1 micromol/L) (n = 24).\n\nHemorrhage increased leukocyte adhesion (stationary count per 150 microm) in rats anesthetized with thiopental (baseline, 3.4 +/- 1.2; hemorrhage, 6.7 +/- 2.0; P < 0.05) but not in those receiving either ketamine (baseline, 3.6 +/- 1.3; hemorrhage, 3.3 +/- 1.3) or propofol/fentanyl (baseline, 6.2 +/- 2.0; hemorrhage, 5.8 +/- 0.8). Neutrophils collected from thiopental-treated rats had elevated CD11b expression with thiopental (mean fluorescence baseline, 67.5 +/- 1.3; hemorrhage, 83.6 +/- 5.3; P < 0.05) but not with propofol/fentanyl (mean fluorescence baseline, 69.1 +/- 1.3; hemorrhage, 65.9 +/- 1.6), and ketamine-treated rats (mean fluorescence baseline, 74.3 +/- 2.1; hemorrhage, 74.8 +/- 1.1). Ketamine also inhibited upregulation of CD11b with platelet activating factor ex vivo.",
        "A decrease in alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) plasma levels in burn patients is typically associated with increased mortality. We hypothesized that vitamin E supplementation (alpha-tocopherol) would attenuate acute lung injury induced by burn and smoke inhalation injury.\n\nUnder deep anesthesia, sheep (33 +/- 5 kg) were subjected to a flame burn (40% total body surface area, third degree) and inhalation injury (48 breaths of cotton smoke, < 40 degrees C). Half of the injured group received alpha-tocopherol (1000 IU vitamin E) orally, 24 h prior to injury. The sham group was neither injured nor given vitamin E. All three groups (n = 5 per group) were resuscitated with Ringer\"s lactate solution (4 ml/kg/%burn/24 h), and placed on a ventilator (PEEP = 5 cmH2O; tidal volume = 15 ml/kg) for 48 h.\n\nPlasma alpha-tocopherol per lipids doubled in the vitamin E treated sheep. Vitamin E treatment prior to injury largely prevented the increase in pulmonary permeability index and moderated the increase in lung lymph flow (52.6 +/- 6.2 ml/min, compared with 27.3 +/- 6.0 ml/min, respectively), increased the PaO2/FiO2 ratio, ameliorated both peak and pause airway pressure increases, and decreased plasma conjugated dienes and nitrotyrosine.",
        "CD4CD25 T cells induce severe colitis when injected into immunodeficient recipients. The migration of disease-inducing cells to the bowel is controlled by adhesion molecules and chemotactic proteins. Chemokine receptors expressed on the T cells are therefore potential targets for anti-inflammatory therapy in inflammatory bowel disease. In this study, we have investigated the role of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 in the development of chronic colitis in a murine model.\n\nExpression of CXCR3 on CD4 T cell from normal and colitic mice was assessed by flow cytometry. Development of colitis was followed after transfer of either normal or CXCR3CD4CD25T cell into immunodeficient host. In addition, the ability of regulatory T cell to function in vivo in the absence of CXCR3 was tested.\n\nWe find CXCR3 to be expressed on 80% to 90% of CD4 T cells isolated from colitic mice compared with only 4% to 10% of CD4 T cells in normal na\u00efve mice. Injecting CD4CXCR3CD25 T cells into immunodeficient hosts results in an ameliorated form of colitis with a lack of clinical symptoms, suggesting that CXCR3 expression is important for enteroantigen priming of CD4 T cells and/or subsequent migration into the gut wall. In contrast, CXCR3 expression does not affect the function of regulatory T cells because CXCR3 regulatory T cells are just as capable as their wild-type counterpart of controlling disease development. The diminished disease-inducing capability of CXCR3 T cells is not caused by the absence of enteroantigen specificity; we also tested the enteroantigen-specific proliferative ability of CD4CD25 T cells from CXCR3 mice in vitro and found that they respond even more strongly than wild-type cells.",
        "The balance of CD28/CTLA4-derived signals and Fas-dependent apoptosis activity is determined by the peripheral defense mechanisms and might play a role in the pathogenesis of allergy.\n\nThe aim of the study was to investigate the expression of costimulatory and pro- and antiapoptotic molecules in adenoid T cells of children suffering from allergic rhinitis and to find out which of these molecules have a predictive value in the development of allergic rhinitis.\n\nThe adenoids of 60 children, removed because of nasal obstruction, chronic rhinitis and recurrent respiratory infection, were evaluated. Patients were divided into two groups: group 1, suffering from chronic allergic rhinitis, and group 2, suffering from chronic rhinitis, where no specific IgE was detected, including children with a positive family history of allergy (group 2a) and children with neither a personal nor a family history of allergy (group 2b). For immunohistochemical stainings anti-CD3, anti-CD19, anti-CD4, anti-CD8, anti-CD25, anti-CD28, anti-CTLA4 (CD152), anti-bcl-2, anti-Fas, and anti-FasL antibodies were used. The number of cells expressing these molecules was identified in adenoid interfollicular spaces. The results were then analyzed in allergic and nonallergic children. During a 24-month follow-up children were re-examined for allergy and results were compared to previous immunohistochemical evaluations.\n\nThe expression of CD4, CD25, CD28, FasL, and CTLA4 was significantly increased in group 1 compared to group 2 (p < 0.05). However, the discriminant analysis confirmed that only CTLA4 and FasL expression fully discriminated allergic subjects from the others. During a 24-month period of observation 8 children from group 2a were also diagnosed with allergic rhinitis. All of them, especially those sensitized to mites, had an increased number of FasL+ and CTLA4+ in previously removed adenoids.",
        "A study of 350 HIV+ patients in our region showed that 16% suffered from hypothyroidism. Twenty-two HIV+ hypothyroid patients (10 with subclinical hypothyroidism, 12 with low FT4 levels (LT4) (confirmed by a dialysis equilibrium assay) and 22 HIV+ euthyroid controls receiving highly active anti-retroviral therapy were included in an additional study.\n\nNo goiter or anti-thyroid antibodies were detected. Use of stavudine was more frequent in the LT4 subgroup (p < 0.01) and subclinical hypothyroidism group (p = 0.04). Use of didanosine (OR, 12.5, p < 0.01) and ritonavir (OR, 33.0, p < 0.01) was more frequent in the LT4 subgroup, with a greater didanosine cumulative dose (616.7 mg [180.0, 1,260.0] vs. 263.7 [63.0, 948.0], p = 0.01). Reverse T3, binding protein levels, the TSH response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone, urinary iodine, plasma selenium and thiocyanate levels did not differ. IFNgamma levels were lower in the subclinical hypothyroidism group (pg/ml) (9.1 [0.0, 22.7] vs. 19.5 [0.0, 40.9], p = 0.03).",
        "Cytokines play important roles in antiviral action. We examined whether polymorphisms of IFN-gamma,TNF-alpha and IL-10 affect the susceptibility to and outcome of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).\n\nA case-control study was carried out in 476 Chinese SARS patients and 449 healthy controls. We tested the polymorphisms of IFN-gamma,TNF-alpha and IL-10 for their associations with SARS.\n\nIFN-gamma +874A allele was associated with susceptibility to SARS in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.001). Individuals with IFN-gamma +874 AA and AT genotype had a 5.19-fold (95% Confidence Interval [CI], 2.78-9.68) and 2.57-fold (95% CI, 1.35-4.88) increased risk of developing SARS respectively. The polymorphisms of IL-10 and TNF-alpha were not associated with SARS susceptibility.",
        "Major trauma and burns are associated with whole body catabolism which can persist for 1 or more years after injury. This study investigates body composition in massively burned children for up to 2 years.\n\nTwenty-five pediatric patients with greater than 40% total body surface area burns were studied. At discharge, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after burn height, weight, body composition, resting energy expenditure (REE), serum growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), insulin, cortisol, parathyroid hormone, and thyroid hormones were measured. Tukey\"s test was used for analysis. Significance was accepted at p < 0.05.\n\nLean body mass, fat mass, bone mineral content, height, and weight increased significantly during the second year after burn. Percent predicted REE decreased significantly, whereas IGFBP-3 and parathyroid hormone levels increased significantly over time. Insulin and T3 uptake were significantly higher at discharge.",
        "To examine prevalence rates of psychopathology in children with velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS).\n\nOne hundred fifty-four children ages 6 to 15 participated in our between-group design with three samples, 84 children with VCFS (37 girls, 47 boys), 32 sibling controls (18 girls, 14 boys), and 38 community controls (12 girls, 26 boys). The Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime version and several other parent report measures were used to assess for psychopathology.\n\nCompared to both control samples, children with VCFS had higher prevalence rates of major depressive disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, simple phobias, and enuresis. Additional findings from our analyses include (1) no gender differences in VCFS psychopathology prevalence rates, (2) children with VCFS who have comorbid psychopathology were rated by their parents as having less well-developed executive functions, and (3) across all three samples, the higher the IQ was, the higher the level of global functioning.",
        "Small diameter PTFE grafts are prone to thrombosis and intimal hyperplasia development. Heparin graft coating has beneficial effects but also potential drawbacks. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the experimental efficacy of PEG-hirudin/iloprost coated small caliber PTFE grafts.\n\nThirty-six femoro-popliteal ePTFE grafts (expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, diameter 4 mm) were inserted into 18 pigs. Grafts were randomised individually for each leg and grouped for 3 groups. Group I consisted of native ePTFE grafts, group II were grafts coated with a polylactide polymer (PLA) without drugs and group III grafts were coated with PLA containing a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-hirudin/iloprost combination. The follow-up period was 6 weeks. Patency rates were calculated and development of pseudointima inside the grafts was noted. Thickness of intimal hyperplasia at the distal anastomoses was measured using light microscopy.\n\nPatency rates for group I were 6/9 (67%), for group II 9/10 (90%) and 12/12 (100%) for group III. In groups I and II there was a significant reduction of blood flow proximal to the graft at graft harvest, to 29+/-12 and 28+/-20 ml/min respectively (both p<0.01 versus preoperative value), whilst in group III blood flow, 99+/-21 ml/min, remained at the preoperative level. Subtotal stenosis due to development of pseudointima was noted in each of the native and PLA coated grafts but not in group III grafts. Intimal hyperplasia at the distal anastomosis was lowest in group III.",
        "Coffee is the major source of dietary antioxidants. The association between coffee consumption and risk of death from diseases associated with inflammatory or oxidative stress has not been studied.\n\nWe studied the relation of coffee drinking with total mortality and mortality attributed to cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other diseases with a major inflammatory component.\n\nA total of 41,836 postmenopausal women aged 55-69 y at baseline were followed for 15 y. After exclusions for cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, colitis, and liver cirrhosis at baseline, 27,312 participants remained, resulting in 410,235 person-years of follow-up and 4265 deaths. The major outcome measure was disease-specific mortality.\n\nIn the fully adjusted model, similar to the relation of coffee intake to total mortality, the hazard ratio of death attributed to cardiovascular disease was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.64, 0.91) for consumption of 1-3 cups/d, 0.81 (95% CI: 0.66, 0.99) for 4-5 cups/d, and 0.87 (95% CI: 0.69, 1.09) for > or =6 cups/d. The hazard ratio for death from other inflammatory diseases was 0.72 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.93) for consumption of 1-3 cups/d, 0.67 (95% CI: 0.50, 0.90) for 4-5 cups/d, and 0.68 (95% CI: 0.49, 0.94) for > or =6 cups/d.",
        "Low-carbohydrate diets may promote greater weight loss than does the conventional low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet.\n\nWe compared weight loss and biomarker change in adults adhering to a ketogenic low-carbohydrate (KLC) diet or a nonketogenic low-carbohydrate (NLC) diet.\n\nTwenty adults [body mass index (in kg/m(2)): 34.4 +/- 1.0] were randomly assigned to the KLC (60% of energy as fat, beginning with approximately 5% of energy as carbohydrate) or NLC (30% of energy as fat; approximately 40% of energy as carbohydrate) diet. During the 6-wk trial, participants were sedentary, and 24-h intakes were strictly controlled.\n\nMean (+/-SE) weight losses (6.3 +/- 0.6 and 7.2 +/- 0.8 kg in KLC and NLC dieters, respectively; P = 0.324) and fat losses (3.4 and 5.5 kg in KLC and NLC dieters, respectively; P = 0.111) did not differ significantly by group after 6 wk. Blood beta-hydroxybutyrate in the KLC dieters was 3.6 times that in the NLC dieters at week 2 (P = 0.018), and LDL cholesterol was directly correlated with blood beta-hydroxybutyrate (r = 0.297, P = 0.025). Overall, insulin sensitivity and resting energy expenditure increased and serum gamma-glutamyltransferase concentrations decreased in both diet groups during the 6-wk trial (P < 0.05). However, inflammatory risk (arachidonic acid:eicosapentaenoic acid ratios in plasma phospholipids) and perceptions of vigor were more adversely affected by the KLC than by the NLC diet.",
        "Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) hyperintensities and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) hypointensities are MRI features of acute stroke. DWI alterations during ischemia recover with early reperfusion, but they can reappear later. Pronounced signal abnormalities early after stroke are associated with infarction, but the significance of subtle changes is unclear. Here we evaluated the degree and time course of regional signal intensity changes during the first 24 hours of reperfusion after transient ischemia, and we related them to the progression of the histopathological damage.\n\nRats (n=54) were subjected to 1-hour intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion to assess the dynamics of MRI signal intensity changes during the initial 24 hours and their correspondent histopathological features: 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining, and hematoxylin and eosin, and immunoreactivity to 70-kDa heat shock protein and to astroglial and microglial markers.\n\nThis model of ischemia caused early striatal infarction but delayed necrosis in the cortex. The striatum showed marked MRI changes from 4 hours of reperfusion. By 12 hours, the striatal ADC signal intensity ratio to the homologous contralateral region was 30% reduced, and the TTC staining evidenced infarction. Contrarily, the cortical ADC ratio was only 15% reduced, and TTC staining was normal at 12 hours. After this time, the cortex showed sudden and pronounced (>30%) ADC signal intensity changes coincidentally with the manifestation of infarction, accompanied with severe vacuolation and unambiguous signs of neuronal and astroglial death.",
        "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced lipid peroxidation is associated with sperm function. Malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity represent the lipid peroxidation and spermicidal antioxidant, respectively. We aimed to evaluate the relationship of MDA and GPx levels with sperm parameters.\n\nSpecimens were divided into two groups: group 1. normospermia (n=20); group 2. oligoasthenospermia (n=31). Seminal MDA concentration was measured by thiobarbituric acid reaction method. Seminal GPx activity was measured by oxidation of reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide. Seminal MDA levels and GPx activities in both groups were compared.\n\nMDA concentrations in both groups were significantly different (1.52 +/- 0.75 vs. 2.25 +/- 0.88 nM, p = 0.0021). GPx activities in both groups were non-significantly different (0.48 +/- 0.11 vs. 0.47 +/- 0.12 U/ml). MDA levels were negatively correlated with the sperm motility (MDA = -0.014 x motility + 2.62, p =0.017) and concentration (MDA = -0.0045 x concentration + 2.23, p = 0.0166). GPx activities were positively but non-significantly correlated with the sperm concentration and sperm motility.",
        "The binding of hematogenously borne malignant cells that express the carbohydrate sialyl Lewis X (sLe(X)) to selectin adhesion receptors on leukocytes, platelets, and endothelial cells facilitates metastasis. The glycosylation inhibitor, per-O-acetylated GlcNAcbeta1,3Galbeta-O-naphthalenemethanol (AcGnG-NM), inhibits the biosynthesis of sLe(X) in tumor cells. To evaluate the efficacy of AcGnG-NM as an antimetastatic agent, we examined its effect on experimental metastasis and on spontaneous hematogenous dissemination of murine Lewis lung carcinoma and B16BL6 melanoma cells.\n\nTumor cells were treated in vitro with AcGnG-NM, and the degree of selectin ligand inhibition and experimental metastasis was analyzed in wild-type and P-selectin-deficient mice. Conditions were developed for systemic administration of AcGnG-NM, and the presence of tumor cells in the lungs was assessed using bromodeoxyuridine labeling in vivo. The effect of AcGnG-NM on inflammation was examined using an acute peritonitis model.\n\nIn vitro treatment of Lewis lung carcinoma cells with AcGnG-NM reduced expression of sLe(X)- and P-selectin-dependent cell adhesion to plates coated with P-selectin. Treatment also reduced formation of lung foci when cells were injected into syngeneic mice. Systemic administration of the disaccharide significantly inhibited spontaneous dissemination of the cells to the lungs from a primary s.c. tumor, whereas an acetylated disaccharide not related to sLe(X) in structure had no effect. AcGnG-NM did not alter the level of circulating leukocytes or platelets, the expression of P-selectin ligands on neutrophils, or sLe(X)-dependent inflammation.",
        "Bisphosphonates (such as risedronate and zoledronate) are widely used inhibitors of bone resorption. Despite their in vitro antiproliferative effects in various cancer cells, bisphosphonates have not exhibited significant antitumor efficacy in animal models of visceral cancer, which may be due to their poor bioavailability. The diagnostic use of radioactive bisphosphonates has revealed the accumulation of bisphosphonates in mesothelioma, which prompted us to test the antitumor efficacy of bisphosphonates in this disease.\n\nTreatment with either risedronate or zoledronate (2 x 10(-4) to 2 x 10(-6) mol/L) inhibited the growth of AB12 and AC29 mouse mesothelioma cells and induced the accumulation of unprenylated Rap1A in these cells. Both these in vitro effects were reversed by geranygeraniol, an end product of the mevalonate pathway that these bisphosphonates inhibit. Both bisphosphonates also induced the phosphorylation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in AB12 and AC29 cells. The inhibition of p38 augmented bisphosphonate-induced growth inhibition in these cells. Bisphosphonate-induced p38 phosphorylation was not reversible by geranylgeraniol. Risedronate (15 mg/kg) and zoledronate (0.5 mg/kg) inhibited the growth of s.c. tumors and increased the median survival of mice with i.p. mesothelioma tumors in vivo.",
        "Liver damage by radiation limits its efficacy in cancer treatment. As radiation can generate apoptotic signals, we wished to examine the potential to protect the liver by inhibiting apoptosis through two key mediators, FAS and tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1).\n\nRadiation-induced liver damage was assessed by serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, hepatocyte micronucleus formation, and apoptosis assays (terminal nucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling and caspase-3 cleavage) in mice. Protection was evaluated by pretreating mice with antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) for FAS or TNFR1 prior to radiation. TNF-alpha production in liver and in Kupffer cells were determined by ELISA.\n\nRadiation increased liver FAS and TNFR1 transcription in a dose- and time-dependent manner (maximized at 25 Gy and 8 hours postirradiation). Pretreatment with ASOs for FAS and TNFR1 resulted in the inhibition of liver FAS and TNFR1 by 78% and 59%, respectively. Inductions of serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were observed at 2 hours after radiation and could be reduced by pretreating mice with ASO for TNFR1 but not FAS or control oligonucleotide. Radiation-induced liver apoptosis (terminal nucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling staining and caspase-3 activation on Western blot) and hepatocyte micronucleus formation were reduced by pretreatment with ASO for TNFR1. In addition, radiation stimulated TNF-alpha production both in irradiated liver and in cultured Kupffer cells by >50% and 100%, respectively.",
        "We sought to evaluate the effect of physical training on neurohormonal activation in patients with heart failure (HF).\n\nPatients with HF benefit from physical training. Chronic neurohormonal activation has detrimental effects on ventricular remodeling and prognosis of patients with HF.\n\nA total of 95 patients with HF were assigned randomly into two groups: 47 patients (group T) underwent a nine-month training program at 60% of the maximal oxygen uptake (VO2), whereas 48 patients did not (group C). The exercise load was adjusted during follow-up to achieve a progressive training effect. Plasma assay of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), norepinephrine, plasma renin activity, and aldosterone; quality-of-life questionnaire; echocardiogram; and cardiopulmonary stress test were performed upon enrollment and at the third and ninth month.\n\nA total of 85 patients completed the protocol (44 in group T, left ventricular ejection fraction [EF] 35 +/- 2%, mean +/- SEM; and 41 in group C, EF 32 +/- 2%, p = NS). At the ninth month, patients who underwent training showed an improvement in workload (+14%, p < 0.001), peak VO2 (+13%, p < 0.001), systolic function (EF +9%, p < 0.01), and quality of life. We noted that BNP, NT-proBNP, and norepinephrine values decreased after training (-34%, p < 0.01; -32%, p < 0.05; -26%, p < 0.01, respectively). Increase in peak VO2 with training correlated significantly with the decrease in both BNP/NT-proBNP level (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively). Patients who did not undergo training showed no changes.",
        "Although mechanisms remain a subject of controversy, there is general agreement that living environments influence allergic risk during the first years of life. We reasoned that sterile house dust extracts (HDEs) would have immunologic activities reflective of their environments of origin and therefore would be useful surrogates for investigations of how ambient exposures influence immune homeostasis.\n\nThese experiments determined how airway HDE exposures influence adaptive responses to a coadministered antigen and subsequent airway hypersensitivity responses to antigen challenge.\n\nMice received intranasal ovalbumin (OVA) vaccinations on a weekly basis. Select groups of mice also received intranasal HDE weekly with OVA; daily at one seventh the weekly dose, beginning 7 days before the first OVA sensitization; or both.\n\nWeekly intranasal vaccinations with OVA and HDE primed mice for the development of T(H)2-biased immune and airway hypersensitivity responses. In contrast, daily low-dose intranasal HDE exposures protected against the immunologic and pathologic outcomes associated with weekly intranasal OVA/HDE vaccinations. The T(H)2 adjuvant activities of HDEs were found to be dependant on MyD88, a molecule critical for signaling through a majority of Toll-like receptors. Moreover, the tolerogenic activity associated with daily intranasal HDE exposures could be replicated with LPS.",
        "The authors describe the procedures used to explain an unexpected finding that adolescents with Down syndrome (DS) had a lower mean length of utterance (MLU) than typically developing (TD) children in interviews without picture support, but not in narratives supported by wordless picture books. They hypothesize that the picture support of the narrative context increased the MLU for the group with DS alone.\n\nAdolescents with DS (n = 14) and TD children (n = 14) matched for receptive syntax narrated picture storybooks and participated in interviews. Transcription reliability, intelligibility/fluency, grammatical errors, discourse and sampling contexts, and discourse characteristics were examined for their effects on MLU.\n\nThe DS group showed a greater responsiveness to adult questions than the TD group; an alternate MLU without yes/no responses showed the same interaction of group and context as the original finding. An additional comparison of MLUs, obtained from narratives present in the interview and narratives elicited using picture books, showed that picture support in narrative increased MLUs only for the group with DS.",
        "Postoperative delirium and cognitive decline are common in elderly surgical patients after non-cardiac surgery. Despite this prevalence and clinical importance, no specific aetiological factor has been identified for postoperative delirium and cognitive decline. In experimental setting in a rat model, nitrous oxide (N(2)O) produces neurotoxic effect at high concentrations and in an age-dependent manner. Whether this neurotoxic response may be observed clinically has not been previously determined. We hypothesized that in the elderly patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery, exposure to N(2)O resulted in an increased incidence of postoperative delirium than would be expected for patients not receiving N(2)O.\n\nPatients who were >or=65 yr of age, undergoing non-cardiac surgery and requiring general anaesthesia were randomized to receive an inhalational agent and either N(2)O with oxygen or oxygen alone. A structured interview was conducted before operation and for the first two postoperative days to determine the presence of delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method.\n\nA total of 228 patients were studied with a mean (range) age of 73.9 (65-95) yr. After operation, 43.8% of patients developed delirium. By multivariate logistic regression, age [odds ratio (OR) 1.07; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.26], dependence on performing one or more independent activities of daily living (OR 1.54; 95% CI 1.01-2.35), use of patient-controlled analgesia for postoperative pain control (OR 3.75; 95% CI 1.27-11.01) and postoperative use of benzodiazepine (OR 2.29; 95% CI 1.21-4.36) were independently associated with an increased risk for postoperative delirium.

        "To identify the disease-causing genetic alteration of split-hand/split-foot malformation (SHFM) in a Chinese family.\n\nThree of the 5 affected individuals from a four-generation Chinese SHFM family were examined physically and radiologically. Peripheral blood samples were collected from Digital photographs of the malformed hands and feet were taken. Peripheral blood samples were collected from 2 affected individuals, and lymphocytes were isolated to undergo high resolution G-banding. Genomic DNA was extracted from the whole blood samples of 4 available family members, including the 3 affected individuals. All 16 exons and their flanking intronic sequences of the TP63 gene were amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequenced directly. Microsatellite markers from the five SHFM loci were analyzed in the available family members by PCR, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining. For semi-quantitative determination of the allele copy number, the polymorphic PCR-amplified fragments representing genetic markers from the SHFM3 locus at chromosome 10q24.3 were sequenced in the affected individuals using normal individuals with identical genotypes as controls.\n\nAll 3 existing affected individuals showed absence of 3 radial fingers, 2 affected individuals had a deep central cleft and central ray deficiency in the feet, and 1 affected individual had a fibular monodactyli, all limb malformations being bilateral and consistent with the phenotype of typical SHFM. G-banding showed normal karyotypes in the 3 affected individuals and no visible cytogenetic abnormality was found. Moreover, no mutation was identified in the TP63 gene. While no haplotype sharing was observed in the markers from loci SHFM1, SHFM4 and SHFM5, potential haplotype sharing was detected in the markers from two loci, SHFM2 and SHFM3, indicating possible causative mutation at SHFM2 or SHFM3. Furthermore, obviously biased silver density toward the allele fragments shared by the 3 affected individuals was observed in the markers from the SHFM3 locus. Comparative sequencing showed roughly one-fold increase of fluorescent signal of the shared fragments in the affected individuals. These results suggested a large-scale DNA duplication within the SHFM3 locus.",
        "Data on recovery from hormonal and metabolic sequelae of alcoholism in strictly controlled alcohol abstinence are mainly restricted to short-term abstention. Our previous findings of persistently decreased plasma and urinary urea concentrations in long-term abstinent alcoholics prompted us to further elucidate this unexplained phenomenon.\n\nThe response of circulating urea cycle metabolites and glucose-regulating hormones to an intravenous load (30 g) of arginine hydrochloride was investigated in abstinent male alcoholics (n = 14) after complete recovery of all routine liver parameters and compared with that in healthy male controls (n = 15).\n\nThe arginine challenge provoked (i) higher peak concentrations of arginine and increased arginine/ornithine and ornithine/citrulline ratios in the plasma of abstinent alcoholics; (ii) augmented plasma glutamine concentrations in alcoholics in the presence of comparable levels in both experimental groups of plasma glutamate, ammonia, and nitrate/nitrite; (iii) parallel increases in plasma urea concentrations over the respective baseline levels but distinctly higher urinary urea excretion in controls; (iv) a blunted blood glucose response to arginine in alcoholics together with a reduced insulin and glucagon surge; and (v) an elevated growth hormone peak as compared with controls.",
        "Thoracotomy is associated with severe pain that may persist for years. Acupuncture is a complementary therapy with a proven role in pain control. A randomized trial showed that acupuncture was effective in controlling pain after abdominal surgery, but the efficacy of this technique for the treatment of thoracotomy pain has not been established. We developed a novel technique for convenient application of acupuncture to patients undergoing thoracotomy, and in a Phase II trial evaluated the safety of this intervention and the feasibility of doing a randomized trial.\n\nAdult patients scheduled for unilateral thoracotomy with preoperative epidural catheter placement received acupuncture immediately prior to surgery. Eighteen semi-permanent intradermal needles were inserted on either side of the spine, and four were inserted in the legs and auricles. Needles were removed after four weeks. Using a numerical rating scale, pain was measured on the first five postoperative days. After discharge, pain was assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory at 7, 30, 60 and 90 days.\n\nThirty-six patients were treated with acupuncture. Of these, 25, 23, and 22 patients provided data at 30, 60, and 90 days, respectively. The intervention was well tolerated by patients with only one minor and transient adverse event of skin ulceration.",
        "Malnutrition is common in obstructive jaundice but is difficult to define. The aim of this study was to compare definitions of malnutrition in patients with obstructive jaundice to identify correlation with mortality, complications and length of hospital stay after intervention.\n\nProspective case-control study comparing 39 inpatients with obstructive jaundice with 21 controls. Body mass index (BMI), skin-fold thickness (TSF), mid-arm muscle circumference (MAMC), percentage weight loss, nutritional risk index (NRI) and malnutrition universal screening tool (MUST) were measured and compared. Duration of admission, interventions, complications and outcome were recorded prospectively.\n\nPatients with obstructive jaundice were significantly malnourished compared to controls. Severe malnutrition was equally prevalent in benign and malignant disease. Malnourished patients had higher mortality and longer duration of stay after intervention compared to non-malnourished patients. NRI<83.5 was significantly associated with mortality and longer duration of hospital admission but not complication rate.",
        "No foolproof preoperative diagnostic indicators of parathyroid carcinoma (PC) exist in absence of nonskeletal metastases. Palpable parathyroid tumor, advanced skeletal and renal manifestations, and very high serum calcium and parathyroid hormone levels are considered strong predictors. Most of these features are common in Indian primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) patients although only few have PC. The aim of this study was to identify dependable clinicoinvestigative predictors of PC in Indian PHPT patients.\n\nClinical, biochemical, radiological, and densitometric attributes of 100 PHPT patients who underwent successful parathyroidectomy (1990-2004) were studied. Various parameters of patient groups with parathyroid adenoma (n = 84), primary hyperplasia (n = 12), and carcinoma (n = 4) were compared using ANOVA, with P value < 0.05 considered significant.\n\nMean age of patients was 37.4 years, with no difference in the 3 groups (P = 0.92). Patients in 3 groups had comparably severe bone disease; 36 had coexistent renal disease. Two patients with PC and 27 (32%) with adenoma had palpable parathyroid tumor. None of the biochemical parameters predicted malignant pathology. Mean tumor weight (milligram) in carcinoma patients (15,080 +/- 5,638.02) was significantly higher than those with adenoma (5,724 +/- 1,257.9) (P = 0.002). Postoperative course and recovery in carcinoma patients were similar to those with adenoma. In follow-up (mean: 33 months), none of the adenoma patients were found to have persistent/recurrent PHPT attributable to missed PC.",
        "Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation may be involved in the pathogenesis of atrial arrhythmias in congestive heart failure (CHF). The effects of aldosterone blockade on atrial tachyarrhythmias have not been evaluated. This study\"s aim was to determine whether selective aldosterone blockade suppresses atrial tachyarrhythmia inducibility and modifies atrial electrical and/or structural remodeling in a canine model of rapid ventricular pacing (RVP)-induced CHF.\n\nDogs were assigned randomly to treatment with oral placebo or eplerenone (50 mg/day) and divided into four groups: two sham-operated (no RVP) and two RVP groups. After 5 weeks of no RVP or RVP at 230 beats/min along with concurrent placebo or eplerenone treatment, dogs underwent electrophysiologic and echocardiographic studies. Sustained atrial tachyarrhythmia inducibility (>10-minute duration), atrial effective refractory periods (ERPs), systolic and diastolic function, and left atrial and left ventricular (LV) chamber sizes were assessed. Placebo-treated RVP dogs developed CHF with LV systolic and diastolic dysfunction, left atrial and LV enlargement, increased atrial ERPs, and inducible sustained atrial tachyarrhythmias. Eplerenone treatment in RVP dogs significantly suppressed sustained atrial tachyarrhythmia inducibility, nonuniformly prolonged atrial ERPs and attenuated LV diastolic dysfunction without modifying left atrial or LV dilation or ejection fractions in CHF. Isoproterenol (2-4 microg/min) reversed eplerenone\"s atrial antiarrhythmic and ERP prolonging effects in CHF. Eplerenone did not alter atrial ERPs in sham (no RVP) dogs without CHF.",
        "Leptin, which is an obese gene product, decreases appetite and increases energy expenditure in adults. In our previous study, leptin was found to maintain neural stem cells and/or progenitor cells, preferentially astrocyte/oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, whereas it reduces the proportion of oligodendrocyte lineage-restricted precursor cells. It has been reported that leptin-deficient (ob/ob) mice have lower levels of glial proteins than wild-type mice. These findings suggest that leptin affects the development of glial cells. In this study, therefore, we investigated oligodendrocyte development in the cerebral cortex of ob/ob and wild-type mouse embryos by histochemistry.\n\nWe obtained ob/ob or wild-type (C57BL/6J) embryos on embryonic day (E) 18. We performed immunohistochemistry in the embryonic cerebrum with antibodies against NG2, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFR-alpha) and leptin receptor (Ob-R). In the cerebral cortex, we compared the number of the oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), which are immunopositive for NG2 and/or PDGFR-alpha, between ob/ob and wild-type embryos.\n\nWe revealed that ob/ob embryos had significantly more OPCs than wild-type embryos on E18. PDGFR-alpha-positive OPCs did not coexpress leptin receptor in the cerebral cortex.",
        "The lateral nucleus of the amygdala is critical for fear conditioning, a paradigm of emotional learning, which requires recognition of an unconditioned stimulus as aversive and association of conditioned stimuli with an unconditioned stimulus. Some patients with temporal lobe epilepsy have amygdaloid damage associated with impaired emotional learning. Fear conditioning also is impaired at least in some animal models of epilepsy. We studied whether contextual or tone-cued fear conditioning is impaired in two status epilepticus models of epilepsy and whether impairment correlates with the extent of damage in the lateral nucleus of the amygdala.\n\nWe induced epilepsy in rats by either systemic kainic acid administration or electrical amygdala stimulation. Behavioral reactions in all phases of fear conditioning were analyzed from videotapes. Damage to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala was analyzed from thionin-stained sections both histologically and by volumetry.\n\nImmediate reflexive responses to unconditioned and conditioned stimuli were preserved, whereas the freezing response to an unconditioned stimulus was reduced. Contextual conditioning was severely impaired, whereas tone-cued conditioning was better preserved. The lateral nucleus pathology did not correlate with impaired fear conditioning.",
        "In vitro studies have shown that C-reactive protein (CRP) attenuates nitric oxide production and inhibits angiogenesis, which may result in impaired collateral development. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between high sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) levels and the extent of coronary collaterals.\n\nWe investigated the association between hsCRP levels and the extent of coronary collaterals according to the Rentrop classification in a cohort of 185 patients who had high-grade coronary stenosis or occlusion on their angiograms.\n\nMean age was 62 years and 80% were males. Subjects with a higher grade of collaterals were significantly less likely to have diabetes mellitus (OR; 0.48, 95% and CI; 0.28, 0.83) or acute coronary syndrome (OR; 0.58, 95% and CI; 0.33, 0.99), but they were more likely to have higher number of vessels with significant stenosis (OR; 1.41, 95% and CI; 1.03, 1.93) and to have received statins (OR; 1.84, 1.09, 3.13). The mean hsCRP values reduced significantly as the Rentrop grades increased (trend, P = 0.0006). After adjusting for age, gender, statin use, clinical presentation with acute coronary syndrome, diabetes mellitus and the number of vessels with significant stenosis, each 10-unit increase in hsCRP values corresponded to a 31% reduced odds of having a higher collateral score (OR; 0.69, 95% and CI; 0.53, 0.90).",
        "Reperfusion of ischemic myocardium has been implicated in extension of infarct size and deleterious clinical outcomes. Anti-inflammatory agents reduce this reperfusion injury. Chemically modified tetracycline-3 (CMT-3) (Collagenex Pharmaceuticals, Newtown, PA, USA) lacks antimicrobial properties yet retains anti-inflammatory activity. We examined infarct size and myocardial function in a porcine coronary artery occlusion/reperfusion model in CMT-3-treated and control animals.\n\nYorkshire pigs (n = 8) underwent median sternotomy, pretreatment with heparin (300 U/kg and 67 U/kg/hr IV) and lidocaine (1 mg/kg IV) and were divided into two groups. Group one (n = 4) had the left anterior descending artery (LAD) occluded for 1 hour, after which it was reperfused for 2 hours. Group two (n = 4) had an identical protocol to group one except CMT-3 (2 mg/kg IV) was administered prior to occlusion of the LAD.\n\nAnimals receiving CMT-3 had significantly decreased infarct size in relation to the ventricular area-at-risk (AAR) (28 +/- 9% vs. 64 +/- 8%; p < 0.05). Myocardial contractile function was superior in the CMT-3 treatment, indicated by a higher cardiac index (2.9 +/- 0.3 vs. 2.0 +/- 0.3 L/min/m(2); p < 0.05) and stroke volume index (22 +/- 2 vs. 17 +/- 1 L/m(2)/beat; p < 0.05).",
        "To study the characteristics of P300 in Tourette\"s syndrome (TS) with and without attention deficiency and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\n\nAuditory evoked P300 were recorded in 19 TS only (TS-ADHD) children, 15 TS with ADHD (TS + ADHD) children and 20 unaffected control subjects, and their waveforms, amplitudes, latencies and topographies were compared at Fz, Cz, C3, C4 and Pz.\n\nThe TS + ADHD group showed shorter latencies than control subjects at all electrode sites (P<0.05 or 0.01), and the TS-ADHD group at CZ and PZ (P<0.05); however, there was no significant difference between control subjects and the TS-ADHD group. The TS-ADHD group showed smaller amplitudes than the control group at all electrode sites (P<0.05), and the TS + ADHD group at Cz (P<0.05); however, there were no significant differences between control subjects and the TS + ADHD group. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of abnormal waveforms between the control, TS, TS-ADHD and TS + ADHD groups, but there were significant differences in the variability of localization of P300 between the control and the TS group (P=0.003), control and TS + ADHD groups (P=0.000), and the TS-ADHD and TS + ADHD groups (P=0.039). P300 in the TS + ADHD group tended to spread out to the left and that of the TS-ADHD group tended to spread out to the right.",
        "To evaluate the early results of a new method to repair malfunctioning bicuspid aortic valves by creating a tricuspid valve with a crown-like (i.e. anatomic) annulus.\n\nTwelve patients (ages from 10 to 27 years) with chronic regurgitation (and flow-dependent stenosis) of a bicuspid aortic valve underwent repair with the principle of creating a tricuspid valve and a crown-like annulus. The fused leaflets were trimmed and reinserted underneath the existing aortic annulus to create one new native cusp. The third leaflet was fashioned out of a xenopericard patch and was inserted underneath the existing annulus as well to restore the crown-like anatomy of a normal aortic annulus. A tricuspid aortic valve with a morphologically normal annulus was thus created, which resulted in improved coaptation of the leaflets. The repair was immediately assessed by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) with the heart loaded at 50%. In two patients, a second run helped fine-tune the repair. Median cross-clamping time was 82 min. Follow-up ranged from 3 to 46 months (median 13 months).\n\nNo significant complication occurred. The function of the aortic valve was excellent with trivial or mild regurgitation in 11 patients and moderate regurgitation in 1 patient. There was no stenosis across the valve. The repair remained stable over time. Remodelling of the left ventricle occurred as expected.",
        "The role of uric acid as a risk factor for myocardial infarction is controversial, and little is known about its role as a risk factor for stroke. Recent evidence suggests that uric acid may be an important causal agent in cardiovascular disease, for example, by inducing renal disease and hence hypertension. We investigated the association between serum uric acid and coronary heart disease and stroke in a large prospective population-based study.\n\nThe study was based on 4385 participants of the Rotterdam Study who, at baseline (1990 to 1993), were > or =55 years of age, free from stroke and coronary heart disease, and had blood taken. Follow-up for incident stroke and myocardial infarction was complete until January 1, 2002. Data were analyzed with Cox proportional hazards models with adjustment for relevant confounders.\n\nAverage follow-up was 8.4 years. High serum uric acid levels were associated with risk of myocardial infarction and stroke; age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratios (95% CIs) for highest versus lowest quintile of uric acid were 1.68 (1.24 to 2.27) for cardiovascular disease (515 cases), 1.87 (1.12 to 3.13) for myocardial infarction (194 cases), 1.57 (1.11 to 2.22) for stroke (381 cases), 1.77 (1.10 to 2.83) for ischemic stroke (205 cases), and 1.68 (0.68 to 4.15) for hemorrhagic stroke (46 cases). Adjustment for other vascular risk factors only slightly attenuated these associations. Associations were stronger in persons without hypertension than in those with hypertension.",
        "Corticomuscular electroencephalographic-electromyographic (EEG-EMG) coherence elicited by speech and nonspeech oromotor tasks in healthy participants and those with Parkinson\"s disease (PD) was examined. Hypotheses were the following: (a) corticomuscular coherence is demonstrable between orbicularis oris (OO) muscles\" EMG and scalp EEG recording; (b) the presence, location, and magnitude of coherence is task specific; (c) differences in corticomuscular coherence patterns exist between healthy and PD participants; and (d) differences will manifest as either increased or decreased coherence values in certain frequency bands, with EEG localization at primary sensorimotor cortex and/or supplementary motor area (SMA).\n\nSimultaneous EEG, EMG (OO), and speech samples were recorded on 20 healthy and 20 PD participants during speech and nonspeech tasks. Fast Fourier transform and coherence analysis was performed with Neuroscan software on 1,000 randomly generated epochs per task per group. Corticomuscular coherence was analyzed between each EEG electrode and right and left superior and inferior OO muscles up to 200 Hz. Significant coherence peaks exceeded 95% confidence limits (.003).\n\nCorticomuscular coherence existed for both groups and for all tasks, but to varying degrees in primary sensorimotor cortex and SMA.",
        "Lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide, is often diagnosed at late stages and responds poorly to conventional therapies, including chemotherapy and irradiation. A great majority of lung tumors are defective in the p53 pathway, which plays an important role in regulating apoptotic response to anticancer agents. PUMA was recently identified as an essential mediator of DNA damage-induced and p53-dependent apoptosis. In this study, we investigated whether the regulation of PUMA by anticancer agents is abrogated in lung cancer cells and whether PUMA expression suppresses growth of lung cancer cells and/or sensitizes lung cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents and irradiation through induction of apoptosis.\n\nThe expression of PUMA was examined in lung cancer cells with different p53 status treated with chemotherapeutic agents. An adenovirus expressing PUMA (Ad-PUMA), alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents or gamma-irradiation, was used to treat lung cancer cells. The growth inhibitory and apoptotic effects of PUMA in vitro and in vivo were examined. The mechanisms of PUMA-mediated growth suppression and apoptosis were investigated through analysis of caspase activation and release of mitochondrial apoptogenic proteins. The cytotoxicities of PUMA on cancer and normal/nontransformed cells were compared. The efficacy of PUMA and p53 in suppressing the growth of lung cancer cells was also compared.\n\nWe showed that the induction of PUMA by chemotherapeutic agents is abolished in p53-deficient lung cancer cells. PUMA expression resulted in potent growth suppression of lung cancer cells and suppressed xenograft tumor growth in vivo through induction of apoptosis. Low dose of Ad-PUMA significantly sensitized lung cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents and gamma-irradiation through induction of apoptosis. The effects of PUMA are mediated by enhanced caspase activation and release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor into the cytosol. Furthermore, PUMA seems to be selectively toxic to cancer cells and more efficient than p53 in suppressing lung cancer cell growth.",
        "In patients with chronic heart failure (HF), mortality is inversely related to haemoglobin (hgb) concentration. We investigated the prognostic importance of anaemia in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) with and without HF.\n\nWe studied 1731 patients with AMI and left ventricular ejection fraction </=35% from the TRAndolapril Cardiac Evaluation (TRACE) study. Mild anaemia (110 g/L</=hgb<120 g/L in women and 120 g/L</=hgb<130 g/L in men) was present in 264 patients (15%), 114 (7%) had moderate (100 g/L</=hgb<110 g/L in women and 110 g/L</=hgb<120 g/L in men) and 59 (3%) had severe (hgb <100 g/L in women and <110 g/L in men) anaemia. According to the WHO criteria (hgb </=120 g/L in women and <130 g/L in men), 25% had anaemia. Anaemia was associated with increasing age, higher serum creatinine, lower body mass index, history of chronic HF, and worse NYHA class. In multivariable analyses including other prognostic factors only severe anaemia was associated with increased mortality, hazard ratio 1.59 (1.20-2.11). Anaemia was of prognostic importance in patients with HF, but not without HF. In HF patients the hazard ratios were 1.73 (1.26-2.36), 1.20 (0.93-1.56) and 1.05 (0.88-1.25) for severe, moderate and mild anaemia, respectively.",
        "The purpose of this study was to determine whether inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a plausible therapeutic strategy in pancreatic cancer.\n\nA human pancreatic cancer cell line (HPAC) was evaluated for the presence of EGFR with rtPCR and immunohistochemistry. Cells were grown in the presence of either 50 or 100 microM of erlotinib (EGFRI) for 72 hours and evaluated using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Eighty-six athymic nude/nude mice underwent orthotopic implantation of 10(7) HPAC cells and were blindly randomized into four groups: (1) Control; (2) Batimastat, a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor (MMPI) at 400 ng/ml qod; (3) EGFRI at 100 mg/kg qd; and (4) MMPI and EGRRI (both). In vitro and in vivo effects of EGFRI with and without MMPI were compared.\n\nHPAC demonstrated high levels of expression of both the EGFR gene and the gene product. In vitro, both doses of EGFRI significantly reduced proliferation of HPAC at 48 (50 microM: 1.15 + 0.05 [st dev] versus 0.63 + 0.09 abs, P < 0.001) and 72 h (50 microM: 1.48 +/- 0.09 versus 0.73 +/- 0.05 abs, P < 0.001, paired Student\"s t-test). In vivo, each treatment group demonstrated a significant survival advantage (P = 0.0002 group 2, P = 0.0001 group 3, P = 0.012 group 4, log rank test) over controls. Mice treated with EGFRI showed reduced tumor implantation, size, weight, metastatic potential, and jaundice as compared to controls and MMPI-treated mice (all P < 0.05, Fisher\"s exact test).",
        "To investigate the correlation between liver echogenicity and serum C-peptide levels in type 2 diabetic patients treated with oral hypoglycaemic agents.\n\nThe study included 231 type 2 diabetic patients (114 men) with a mean age of 64.3 +/- 6.9 years and a mean diabetes duration of 8.5 +/- 3.2 years. Liver echogenicity was graded by ultrasound examination as follows: Grade 0 (normal liver texture), grade 1 (slight increase of liver echogenicity), grade 2 (moderate increase of liver echogenicity with impaired visualization of intrahepatic vessels and right hemi-diaphragm), grade 3 (marked increase of liver echogenicity with very poor visualization or non-visualization of intrahepatic vessels and right hemi-diaphragm). Serum C-peptide was measured both in fasting state (Fasting C-peptide, FCP) and after glucagon administration (Glucagon-stimulated C-peptide, GCP).\n\nFCP (median; interquartile range) showed a significant difference (p=0.041) between patients with grade 0 (1.9 ng/dl; 1.1-2.7 ng/dl),grade 1 (2.7 ng/dl; 1.9-3.7 ng/dl), grade 2 (4.1 ng/dl; 2.6-5.1 ng/dl) and grade 3 (6.2 ng/dl; 4.6-7.5 ng/dl) liver echogenicity. GCP (median; interquartile range) also differed significantly (p=0.04) between patients with grade 0 (2.6 ng/dl; 1.8-3.3 ng/dl), grade 1 (4.3 ng/dl; 3.3-5 ng/dl), grade 2 (5.8 ng/dl; 4.6-6.9 ng/dl) and grade 3 (8.3 ng/dl; 6.6-9.5 ng/dl) liver echogenicity. In multiple regression analysis, both FCP and GCP showed significant (p < 0.05) positive correlations with waist circumference, triglycerides, WHR and liver echogenicity.",
        "Reliable data on the costs attributable to nosocomial infection (NI) are crucial to demonstrating the real cost-effectiveness of infection control measures. Several studies investigating this issue with regard to intensive care unit (ICU) patients have probably overestimated, as a result of inappropriate study methods, the part played by NIs in prolonging the length of stay.\n\nData from a prospective study of the incidence of NI in 5 ICUs over a period of 18 months formed the basis of this analysis. For describing the temporal dynamics of the data, a multistate model was used. Thus, ICU patients were counted as case patients as soon as an NI was ascertained on any particular day. All patients were then regarded as control subjects as long as they remained free of NI (time-to-event data analysis technique).\n\nAdmitted patients (n=1,876) were observed for the development of NI over a period of 28,498 patient-days. In total, 431 NIs were ascertained during the study period (incidence density, 15.1 NIs per 1,000 patient-days). The influence of NI as a time-dependent covariate in a proportional hazards model was highly significant (P< .0001, Wald test). NI significantly reduced the discharge hazard (hazard ratio, 0.72 [95% confidence interval, 0.63-0.82])--that is, it prolonged the ICU stay. The mean prolongation of ICU length of stay due to NI (+/- standard error) was estimated to be 5.3+/-1.6 days.",
        "The objective of this study was to determine the minimum volume of blood that should be discarded from a range of different types of central venous catheter (CVC), such that the subsequent blood sample was not diluted or contaminated by the residual intra-luminal fluid.\n\nSeventy children aged 1-19 years with central venous access inserted as part of their standard clinical treatment were recruited to this prospective study. Statistical comparison of the extent of variation in biochemical and haematological parameters observed between two blood samples taken following routine 5 ml discard blood volumes, as compared to the extent of variation between samples drawn following a 5 ml discard volume and <5 ml volumes, was carried out.\n\nData indicate that the measurement error in a clinical sample obtained following a 3 ml discard volume is no different to the measurement error obtained when using a standard 5 ml discard volume. Comparable results were obtained from patients with various different types of CVC or portacath access.",
        "Increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) are associated with the presence and severity of atherosclerosis, and with increased risk of coronary events as well as of cardiac events after coronary percutaneous intervention.\n\nWe have investigated whether preoperative CRP had an impact on the long-term outcome of 843 patients who underwent on-pump coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG).\n\nAmong operative survivors, patients with preoperative CRP < 1.0 mg/dL had significantly better 12-year overall survival rate (74.1% vs 63.0%, p = 0.004) and survival freedom from fatal cardiac event (86.7% vs 78.1%). Multivariate analysis including patients\" age, extracardiac arteriopathy, urgent/emergent operation, recent myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction, atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack/stroke, number of distal anastomoses, diabetes, and preoperative CRP > or = 1.0 mg/dL or <1.0 mg/dL, showed that the latter was an independent predictor of late all-cause mortality (p = 0.017, RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.09-2.35). Its impact on overall survival was particularly evident in patients with left ventricular ejection fraction <50% (CRP < 1.0 mg/dL: 58.7% vs CRP > or = 1.0 mg/dL: 43.7%, p < 0.00001).",
        "Retrosternal goitre was defined as any thyroid enlargement identified below the thoracic inlet at operation, with the patient\"s neck held in extension.

Vitamin D receptor (VDR) activation depends on activated vitamin D [1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)(2)D)] concentration, reflecting opposing actions of 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1alpha-hydroxylase [1-alpha(OH)ase] for formation and 25(OH)D-24-hydroxylase [24(OH)ase] for catabolism. We previously reported that circulating 1,25(OH)(2)D contributed to determination of VDR-protein levels and VDR genotype was a determinant of both VDR mRNA and VDR-protein in South Asians.\n\nWe hypothesized that chewing betel nut, an addictive habit common throughout South Asian communities, contributes to hypovitaminosis-D by modulating the enzymes regulating circulating 1,25(OH)(2)D concentration.\n\nPeripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) 1-alpha(OH)ase and 24(OH)ase mRNA concentrations were measured and examined in relation to cross-sectional data on the vitamin-D axis, diet, smoking, and betel usage, including PBMC VDR-RNA and VDR-protein content in a pilot study of 33 healthy British Bangladeshis.\n\nPBMC 24(OH)ase mRNA correlated positively and serum 1,25(OH)(2)D negatively with betel quids per day (r = 0.49, P = 0.006 and r = -0.486, P = 0.006, respectively). Independent determinants for 24(OH)ase included betel quids per day (P < 0.0001) and serum 25-OHD (P = 0.024). Independent determinants for serum 1,25(OH)(2)D were gender, smoking, and betel quids per day. PBMC 1-alpha(OH)ase mRNA correlated inversely with VDR mRNA (r = -0.44; P = 0.013); its independent determinants were serum 1,25(OH)(2)D and VDR TaqI and BsmI polymorphisms (P = 0.03-0.0001).",
        "The present study examined whether exercise training could increase survival in a rodent model of salt-sensitive hypertension.\n\nMale, inbred Dahl salt-sensitive rats arriving at 8 wk of age were randomly divided into a sedentary control group (N = 5) or an exercise-trained group (N = 8). Exercise training consisted of running 20 m.min(-1), 0% incline, 60 min.d(-1), 5 d.wk(-1) on a motorized driven treadmill. On arrival, animals were fed a low-salt diet (0.12% NaCl) during a 1-wk acclimatization period. At the end of this period, all rats were then fed a high-salt diet (7.8% NaCl) for the remainder of the study. Arterial systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured via the tail-cuff method.\n\nSystolic blood pressure (SBP) measured on the low salt diet was similar between groups. After 2 wk of a high-salt diet, SBP was similarly significantly elevated in both control and exercise groups relative to the low salt diet. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that exercise training increased survival (P < 0.02) with an approximate 30% increase in the mean days survived with exercise training (P < 0.02).",
        "Intimal hyperplasia (IH) is most commonly the cause of graft occlusion in infrainguinal bypass grafting for arterial occlusive disease. We investigated the influence of nitric oxide on the IH of the arterial vessel wall at the region of prosthetic bypass anastomoses.\n\nExperiments were performed in 10 Foxhound dogs. We used a technique of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) overexpression by a non-virus-mediated, liposome-based iNOS gene transfer. The plasmid pSCMV-iNOS, which drives the expression of iNOS under control of the cytomegalovirus promoter, was complexed with cationic liposomes (lipoplexes). Segments of both carotid arteries were pretreated by intramural injection of a lipoplex solution by using an infiltrator balloon catheter (Infiltrator Drug Delivery Balloon System). In each dog, iNOS was administered at one side, and a control vector (pSCMV2) was administered at the contralateral side. Carotid arteries were ligated, and bypass grafts (expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, 6-mm, ring enforced) were implanted on both sides. The proximal and distal anastomoses (end-to-side fashion; running nonabsorbable sutures) were placed in the pretreated regions. After 6 months, the prostheses were excised, and the intimal thicknesses of 50 cross sections (orcein staining) of each anastomosis were measured planimetrically.\n\nThe average reduction of the neointima thickness of the iNOS side in proximal anastomoses at the prosthetic wall, suture region, and arterial wall was 43%, 52%, and 81%, respectively. In distal anastomoses, the average reduction was 40%, 47%, and 52%, respectively. All differences of neointima thickness between the iNOS and control sides were statistically significant (Wilcoxon test; P < or = .05).",
        "Many patients with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) continue to have seizures after surgical treatment. The usual explanation for the poor surgical outcome is the presence of residual dysplastic tissue missed by the preoperative neuroimaging investigation and therefore not resected during surgery. We apply a voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis to the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from patients with epilepsy and visually detected FCD to investigate whether (a) VBM is able to detect gray-matter concentration (GMC) abnormalities in patients with FCD, and (b) whether the extent of GMC abnormalities in the brain of these patients differs from the regions observed by using visual inspection.\n\nWe studied 11 patients with visually detected FCD (eight of them with histologic confirmation of FCD). The GMC from each one of these patients was compared with the mean GMC from a control group of 96 normal healthy subjects by using an optimized VBM protocol.\n\nTen of 11 patients showed statistically significant GMC excess, and among patients with GMC excess, only one showed GMC excess that was not exactly correspondent to the visually detected FCD. Seven patients exhibited excess in GMC extending beyond the area of visually detected FCD.",
        "Relapse of ulcerative colitis is difficult to predict by routine colonoscopy. A high-resolution video-magnifying colonoscope with chromoscopy enables the observation of colorectal mucosal pit patterns.\n\nTo investigate the association of pit patterns as assessed by magnifying colonoscopy (MCS) with histological inflammation and mucosal chemokine activity in patients with quiescent ulcerative colitis, and to prospectively analyse the prognostic factors that may predict exacerbations.\n\nMCS was performed in 113 patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. Pit patterns in the rectal mucosa were classified into four MCS grades on the basis of size, shape and arrangement. Mucosal interleukin (IL) 8 activity was measured in biopsy specimens of rectal mucosa and the specimens were assessed for histological disease activity. The patients were then followed until relapse or for a maximum of 12 months. Multivariate survival analysis was carried out to determine the independent predictors of clinical relapse.\n\nA positive correlation was identified between MCS grade, histological grade (p = 0.001) and mucosal IL8 activity (p<0.001). Multivariate proportional hazard model analysis showed that MCS grade was a significant predictor of relapse (relative risk 2.06, p = 0.001). Kaplan-Meier estimate of relapse during 12 months of follow-up was found to increase with increasing MCS grade, with values of 0% for grade 1, 21% for grade 2, 43% for grade 3 and 60% for grade 4.",
        "To evaluate a possible reduction in shoulder diameter and circumference by extending the posterior arm during delivery, for an easier birth in cases of shoulder dystocia.\n\nIn this study of 33 neonates the bisacromial diameter and axilloacromial circumference were measured within 72 h of birth, first with the neonate\"s arms by its chest and then with 1 arm extended above its head. Reductions in diameter and circumference were evaluated.\n\nThe mean +/- SD differences in bisacromial diameter and axilloacromial circumference were 1.9 +/- 0.69 cm and 2.52 +/- 1.18 cm, respectively. A greater reduction was observed in neonates with a greater shoulder diameter.",
        "Exertional hyponatremia ((Na) < 135 mmol x L(-1)) is a potentially serious condition associated with endurance sports. It has been postulated that nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) use may be a risk factor. This observational cohort study aimed to determine whether NSAID use is a risk factor for exertional hyponatremia and altered renal function during endurance exercise.\n\nA total of 330 athletes in the 2004 New Zealand Ironman triathlon (3.8-km swim, 180-km cycle, and 42.2-km run) were weighed before and after the race. A blood sample was drawn for measurement of plasma sodium (Na), potassium (K), urea (urea), and creatinine (creatinine) concentrations postrace.\n\nThe incidence of NSAID use was 30%, whereas the overall incidence of hyponatremia was 1.8%. NSAID use was related to the incidence of hyponatremia (P = 0.0002). The NSAID group had lower plasma Na (P = 0.02) and higher plasma K (P = 0.002), urea (P = 0.05), and creatinine (P = 0.01). Lower Na was also significantly related to female gender, lower prerace body weight, younger age and a smaller weight loss during the race. Race times were not associated with plasma Na; however, faster triathletes lost more weight. Estimated fluid intake was not different in the NSAID group, but heavier triathletes reported greater fluid intakes.",
        "The aim of the study was to examine the effect of acid-base status on serum prolactin (PRL) concentration postexercise.\n\nSeven male recreational athletes participated in two experimental trials separated by 1 wk. In the respective trial, subjects received either a placebo infusion (normal isotonic saline) or an alkali infusion (isotonic sodium bicarbonate) before and during exercise. Venous and capillary blood samples were drawn at rest, immediately after a 10-min warm-up period, and after a maximal ramp test on a cycle ergometer, as well as at 3, 6, 10, and 15 min postexercise.\n\nPower output, HR, capillary blood lactate concentration, carbon dioxide pressure (PCO2), and partial oxygen pressure (PO2) did not differ between trials at any point in time. Capillary PO2 did not change from resting values, but a significant increase (P < 0.05) was found from the end of warm-up to 3 min of the recovery period. Exercise induced a significant (P < 0.01) decrease in capillary blood bicarbonate concentration (HCO3-), pH, base excess (BE), and PCO2 at exhaustion and during the recovery period. Significantly higher HCO3-, pH, and BE were found during bicarbonate infusion and postexercise in comparison with the placebo trial. Serum PRL concentration was significantly increased 3 min postexercise until the end of the placebo trial, whereas after bicarbonate infusion, serum PRL concentration did not change from values at rest. Significant (P < 0.01) differences between trials in serum PRL concentration were found 10 and 15 min postexercise.",
        "Oral L-arginine supplementation has been shown to improve treadmill time to exhaustion and resting insulin sensitivity in individuals with peripheral vascular disease and type 2 diabetes, respectively. Furthermore, L-citrulline supplementation increases plasma L-arginine concentration to a level higher than that achieved by oral L-arginine supplementation. The purpose of this investigation was therefore to determine whether time to exhaustion during a graded treadmill test, as well as plasma insulin and glucose profiles, could be improved with oral L-citrulline supplementation in healthy individuals.\n\nSeventeen young (18-34 yr), healthy male and female volunteers performed incremental treadmill tests to exhaustion following either placebo or citrulline ingestion (3 g 3 h before test, or 9 g over 24 h prior to testing).\n\nSteady-state submaximal respiratory exchange ratio and VO2max were not significantly different between placebo and citrulline trials. Treadmill time to exhaustion was lower following citrulline ingestion than during placebo trials (888.2 +/- 17.7 vs 895.4 +/- 17.9 s; P < 0.05; N = 17), which was accompanied by a higher rating of perceived exertion during exercise in the L-citrulline compared with the placebo condition. There was also an increase in plasma insulin in response to this high-intensity exercise in the placebo, but not in the L-citrulline, condition (P < 0.05).",
        "Previous studies have examined the response of muscle protein to resistance exercise and nutrient ingestion. Net muscle protein synthesis results from the combination of resistance exercise and amino acid intake. No study has examined the response of muscle protein to ingestion of protein in the context of a food. This study was designed to determine the response of net muscle protein balance following resistance exercise to ingestion of nutrients as components of milk.\n\nThree groups of volunteers ingested one of three milk drinks each: 237 g of fat-free milk (FM), 237 g of whole milk (WM), and 393 g of fat-free milk isocaloric with the WM (IM). Milk was ingested 1 h following a leg resistance exercise routine. Net muscle protein balance was determined by measuring amino acid balance across the leg.\n\nArterial concentrations of representative amino acids increased in response to milk ingestion. Threonine balance and phenylalanine balance were both > 0 following milk ingestion. Net amino acid uptake for threonine was 2.8-fold greater (P < 0.05) for WM than for FM. Mean uptake of phenylalanine was 80 and 85% greater for WM and IM, respectively, than for FM, but not statistically different. Threonine uptake relative to ingested was significantly (P < 0.05) higher for WM (21 +/- 6%) than FM (11 +/- 5%), but not IM (12 +/- 3%). Mean phenylalanine uptake/ingested also was greatest for WM, but not significantly.",
        "We have previously demonstrated that progesterone has a stimulatory effect on HLA-G gene expression. Because this effect was abolished by the anti-progestin, RU486, we hypothesize that this effect is through receptor-mediated up-regulation of the HLA-G gene. The objective of this study was to explore the molecular mechanisms of this effect.\n\nThe transient transfection of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) construct containing a fragment of the HLA-G gene promoter into the JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cell line was performed. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and a DNA fragment-binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were carried out to locate a specific progesterone response element (PRE) in the HLA-G gene promoter region.\n\nProgesterone treatment of JEG-3 cells transfected with the HLA-G gene promoter-CAT construct resulted in an increase of CAT synthesis, whereas RU486 blocked this transcriptional activation. A novel PRE-binding site sequence, with 60% homology to that of wild-type mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV) PRE, was discovered in this region.",
        "Colorectal cancer is associated with a \"field change\" of increased proliferation throughout the colonic and rectal mucosa. Both proliferation and apoptosis are disrupted during carcinogenesis. Whether altered apoptosis contributes to this field change of microscopic abnormality is, however, unclear. Bcl-xL is an anti-apoptotic protein that inhibits apoptosis by preventing release of cytochrome c, a recognised pathway to cell death.\n\nTo determine whether Bcl-xL inhibition of apoptosis is increased in colorectal mucosa adjacent to colorectal adenocarcinoma over that in normal non-neoplastic colorectal mucosa.\n\nPATIENTS undergoing surgical resection for neoplastic (adenocarcinoma) or non-neoplastic disease of the colorectum (rectal prolapse, diverticular disease or volvulus).\n\nFormalin-fixed, paraffin-wax-embedded surgical colorectal resection specimens were immunostained for Bcl-xL protein. Labelling indices were determined by counting the proportion of positively stained cells in mucosal crypts.\n\n85 patients were studied. Bcl-xL immunostaining was most marked in the upper third of mucosal crypts. It occurred in a minority of samples from non-neoplastic colorectal mucosa, but was seen in most mucosal samples adjacent to colorectal adenocarcinoma. Significant increases (p<0.001) were observed in Bcl-xL labelling indices in the mucosa at 1 cm (n = 46, median labelling index 31.8%, interquartile range 8.3-43.9%) and at 10 cm (n = 52, median labelling index 22.0%, interquartile range 0.0-36.3%) from colorectal carcinoma, compared with normal, non-neoplastic colorectal mucosa (n = 22, median labelling index 0.0%, interquartile range 0.0-0.0%).",
        "The aim of this study was to assess whether carbon dioxide insufflation (CDI) pneumoperitoneum prevents intraperitoneal adhesions (IPAs).\n\nLaparotomy was performed in 40 8-week-old Lewis rats and their bowels delivered through the wound and manipulated. The rats were divided into 4 groups, namely, those that would have laparotomy (Lp group, n = 15), Lp with CDI (Lp-CDI group, n = 15), Lp and bowel anastomosis (LpBA group, n = 5), and LpBA with CDI (LpBA-CDI group, n = 5). LpBA and LpBA-CDI group rats had 1 cm of ileum excised and end-to-end anastomosis performed. To accelerate IPA formation, all rats then had their bowels heated to 45 degrees C for 40 seconds and 0.5 mL of Lewis rat blood spilled over them. Rats in the control group (n = 5) had Lp alone without heating or blood spillage. Pneumoperitoneum involved insufflating carbon dioxide into the peritoneal cavity through a cannula at the time of final abdominal closure to create pneumoperitoneum to a pressure of 5 mm Hg. All rats had relaparotomy 10 days after surgery and IPAs were assessed blindly using an IPA severity score (IPASS: 0 = no adhesions, 1 = no serosal tears during adhesiolysis, 2 = serosal tears during adhesiolysis, 3 = bowel perforation during adhesiolysis). Only the worst IPA in each rat was scored. Rats were killed after the peritoneum and bowels were excised for histopathology.\n\nPneumoperitoneum resolved in approximately 5 days. There were no associated side effects. The Lp-CDI group had significantly lower IPASS than the Lp group (0.23 +/- 0.46 vs 1.07 +/- 1.18, P < .05), and the LpBA-CDI group had significantly lower IPASS than the LpBA group (1.50 +/- 0.61 vs 2.40 +/- 0.55, P < .05). Histopathology showed pneumoperitoneum had no effect on the peritoneum or bowels.",

Subjects were not treated with any vitamin supplement before the intervention.\n\nPatients were randomly assigned to one of three groups, control (n = 20), a daily injection of 50 mg vitamin B-6 (B6 -50, n=15), or 100 mg vitamin B-6 (B6 -100, n = 16) for 14 days.\n\nPlasma pyridoxal 5\"-phosphate (PLP), pyridoxal (PL), 4-pyridoxic acid (4-PA), erythrocyte alanine (EALT-AC) and aspartate (EAST-AC) aminotransaminase activity coefficient, and urinary 4-PA were measured. The levels of serum albumin, hemoglobin, hematocrit, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and immune responses (white blood cell, neutrophils, total lymphocytes count (TLC), T- (CD3) and B-(CD19) lymphocytes, T-helper (CD4) and suppressor (CD8) cells) were determined.\n\nPlasma PLP, PL, 4-PA and urinary 4-PA concentrations significantly increased in two treated groups. T-lymphocyte and T-helper cell numbers and the percentage of T-suppressor cell significantly increased on day 14 in the B6 -50 group. Total lymphocyte count, T-helper and T-suppressor cell numbers, the percentage of T-lymphocyte cells and T-suppressors significantly increased in the B6 -100 group at the 14th day.

        "To establish the relationship between the presence and titer of virus-specific serum- and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-antibodies in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and disease severity measured with different quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques.\n\nWe investigated an association between clinical and MRI measures of disease activity and the presence and titer of IgG antibodies against seven common viruses (measles, rubella, herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2, varicella zoster virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus). One hundred and forty (90 female/50 male) patients with definite MS and 131 age and sex-matched controls participated in the study. Antibody positivity and titer were ascertained by the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique and clinical assessment was performed by evaluating the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) score and the lifetime relapse rate (LRR). T1- and T2-lesion loads (LL) and the brain parenchymal fraction (BPF) were calculated.\n\nMultiple analyses showed that there was an association between antibody positivity against CMV and higher titer and better clinical and MRI outcomes. The cluster analyses indicated that patients positive for antibodies against CMV had significantly older age at onset (uncorr p = 0.001 and corr p = 0.009), lower LRR (uncorr p = 0.003 and corr p = 0.03) and higher BPF (uncorr p = 0.004 and pcorr p = 0.04).

        "Obese people exhibit reduced circulating peptide YY (PYY) levels, but it is unclear whether this is a consequence or cause of obesity. We therefore investigated the effect of Pyy ablation on energy homeostasis.\n\nBody composition, i.p. glucose tolerance, food intake and hypothalamic neuropeptide expression were determined in Pyy knock-out and wild-type mice on a normal or high-fat diet.\n\nPyy knock-out significantly increased bodyweight and increased fat mass by 50% in aged females on a normal diet. Male chow-fed Pyy (-/-) mice were resistant to obesity but became significantly fatter and glucose-intolerant compared with wild-types when fed a high-fat diet. Pyy knock-out animals exhibited significantly elevated fasting or glucose-stimulated serum insulin concentrations vs wild-types, with no increase in basal or fasting-induced food intake. Pyy knock-out decreased or had no effect on neuropeptide Y expression in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, and significantly increased proopiomelanocortin expression in this region. Male but not female knock-outs exhibited significantly increased growth hormone-releasing hormone expression in the ventromedial hypothalamus and significantly elevated serum IGF-I and testosterone levels. This sex difference in activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary somatotrophic axis by Pyy ablation may contribute to the resistance of chow-fed male knock-outs to late-onset obesity.",
        "The purpose of this study was to investigate the prognostic impact of p53 and p16 expression in curettage material from patients with endometrial carcinoma.\n\nPreoperative curettage material from a population-based series of 236 endometrial carcinomas from Norway with long and complete follow-up was studied immunohistochemically for p53 and p16 expression.\n\nPathologic expression of p53 and p16 was seen in 24% and 25%, respectively, and was significantly correlated with high International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage and serous/clear cell histologic subtypes. Pathologic p53 expression showed significant correlation with postmenopausal status, high grade, high tumor cell proliferation, and aneuploidy. Patients with normal expression had 85% 5-year survival compared with 51% and 50% when pathologic expression of p53 and p16, respectively. Five-year survival for patients with 2 pathologic markers was 13%, compared with 67% and 91% for 1 or no pathologic markers, respectively.",
        "The MRP1 gene encodes the 190 kDa multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1/ABCC1) and effluxes diverse drugs and xenobiotics. Sequence variations within this gene might account for differences in drug response in different individuals. To facilitate association studies of this gene with diseases and/or drug response, exons and flanking introns of MRP1 were screened for polymorphisms in 142 DNA samples from four different populations.\n\nSeventy-one polymorphisms, including 60 biallelic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), ten insertions/deletions (indel) and one short tandem repeat (STR) were identified. Thirty-four of these polymorphisms have not been previously reported. Interestingly, the STR polymorphism at the 5\" untranslated region (5\"UTR) occurs at high but different frequencies in the different populations. Frequencies of common polymorphisms in our populations were comparable to those of similar populations in HAPMAP or Perlegen. Nucleotide diversity indices indicated that the coding region of MRP1 may have undergone negative selection or recent population expansion. SNPs E10/1299 G>T (R433S) and E16/2012 G>T (G671V) which occur at low frequency in only one or two of four populations examined were predicted to be functionally deleterious and hence are likely to be under negative selection.",
        "To prepare the PEGylated liposomes modified with cell penetrating peptides, which protect siRNA from nuclease degradation and deliver efficiently siRNA into cells to facilitate silencing of target gene.\n\nThe purity of R8-PEG-PE and pNP-PEG-PE was detected by HPLC; the quantity of R8, PEG-DPPE modified R8, and R8 attached to the out membrane surface of the liposomal siRNA by transfer from R8-PEG-DPPE micelles to the liposomes was tested by fluorescence; Size and size distribution of siRNA loaded liposomes with and without attached R8 were determined by Zetasizer 5000; A comparison of mediated siRNA transfection efficiency between R8-liposomes and lipofectamine 2000 was examined by individual inside cell fluorescence intensity; The growth inhibition of small cell lung carcinoma NCI-H446 cells treated with R8-liposomal hdm2-siRNA or lipofectamine 2000-hdm2-siRNA complex was tested by MTT assay.\n\nThe retention times of PEG-DPPE and R8-PEG-DPPE were 9.0 min and 7.8 min, respectively. Fluorescence scanning indicated that lipids composed of liposomes and siRNAs didn\"t interfere to the determination of R8 when it was attached to the liposomal siRNA. The cells treated with R8-liposomal hdm2-siRNA significantly enhanced the cellular uptake of hdm2-siRNA and facilitated the functions of hdm2-siRNA through silencing of target gene which, in turn, inhibited tumor cell growth, compared with lipofectamine 2000.",
        "Epidemiological evidence implicates a connection between human periodontitis and systemic diseases. One possible mechanism involves the direct dissemination of periodontopathogens to the target organs through the circulation. The aim of this work was to define the mechanism used by Porphyromonas gingivalis for dissemination from a sequestered infection site.\n\nBALB/c mice were subcutaneously infected with P. gingivalis via use of a mouse chamber model. Tissue fluids from various sites were collected and cultured to determine the presence of P. gingivalis. Evans Blue dye was used to measure the dissemination ability of P. gingivalis. Kinin-associated molecules were introduced into mice, and their effects on bacterial dissemination and mouse pathology were monitored.\n\nP. gingivalis strain A7436 caused remote lesions and septicemia with severe cachexia, resulting in animal death. Intrachamber challenge with A7436 resulted in vascular permeability enhancement (VPE), as measured by the systemic infiltration of Evans Blue dye into chamber fluids. VPE was blocked by kininase and kinin receptor antagonist and enhanced by exogenous bradykinin and kininase inhibitor. Live bacteria were recovered from the subcutaneous perichamber and abdominal spaces (spreading), and from the blood (disseminating) of infected mice. Both kininase and kinin receptor antagonist reduced animal mortality as a result of infection with strain A7436 and decreased the number of bacteria recoverable from the blood, but they were not associated with bacterial spreading.",
        "The etiology of achalasia is still unknown. The aim of the present study was to elucidate its underlying pathologies and their chronology by investigation of esophageal specimens in patients undergoing surgery (esophageal resection or myotomy) for achalasia.\n\nIn 17 patients with achalasia, histopathologic examinations of the esophageal wall focussing on the myenteric plexus were performed. Preoperative diagnosis was based on clinical evaluation, esophagogastroscopy, barium esophagogram in all, and esophageal manometry in eight patients. The median age at the time of surgery was 54 years (range: 14-78 years). In eight cases, the complete esophageal, body and in nine cases a smooth muscle biopsy including parts of the myenteric plexus from the distal part of the esophagus (high pressure zone) was available. The tissue specimens were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin. The staining procedures were hematoxylin and eosin (HE), Elastica van Gieson (EvG), and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) reaction. Immunohistochemical examinations were performed with antibodies against B and T lymphocytes, neurofilament, protein gene-related product (PGP 9.5), S-100 protein, myosin, desmin, smooth muscle actin and substance P.\n\nIn 13 of 17 patients, a significant reduction of the number of intramural ganglion cells was present. Common findings were a severe fibrosis of the smooth muscle layer (10/17) and obvious myopathic changes of the smooth muscle cells (5/17). Staining for B and T lymphocytes found signs of inflammation in mucosal and muscular areas. Three patients exhibited a marked invasion of eosinophilic granulocytes of the muscularis propria (eosinophilia). Esophageal carcinoma had developed in three patients (squamous cell carcinoma in two and carcinoma in situ in another patient with Barrett\"s esophagus and high-grade dysplasia). Severe inflammatory reactions (neural, eosinophilic and mucosal) dominated in patients with a longstanding history of achalasia (>10 years) as well as a marked endomysial fibrosis.",

They underwent spirometric testing, exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) measurement, sputum induction for differential cell count, and ambulatory cough monitoring for 24 hours. Coughing episodes were counted both as individual spikes and as clusters.\n\nAll children had mild intermittent asthma and their median forced expiratory volume in 1 second and eNO were 83.3% (IQR 81.1-97.6) and 56.1 ppb (IQR 37.4-105), respectively. The median number of cough episodes per day was 25.5 (IQR 16-42.8).

        "Recent studies have shown excellent clinical results using eccentric squat training on a 25 degrees decline board to treat patellar tendinopathy. It remains unknown why therapeutic management of patellar tendinopathy using decline eccentric squats offer superior clinical efficacy compared to standard horizontal eccentric squats. This study aimed to compare electromyography activity, patellar tendon strain and joint angle kinematics during standard and decline eccentric squats.\n\nThirteen subjects performed unilateral eccentric squats on flat-and a 25 degrees decline surface. During the squats, electromyography activity was obtained in eight representative muscles. Also, ankle, knee and hip joint goniometry was obtained. Additionally, patellar tendon strain was measured in vivo using ultrasonography as subjects maintained a unilateral isometric 90 degrees knee angle squat position on either flat or 25 degrees decline surface.\n\nPatellar tendon strain was significantly greater (P<0.05) during the squat position on the decline surface compared to the standard surface. The stop angles of the ankle and hip joints were significantly smaller during the decline compared to the standard squats (P<0.001, P<0.05). Normalized mean electromyography amplitudes of the knee extensor muscles were significantly greater during the decline compared to the standard squats (P<0.05). Hamstring and calf muscle mean electromyography did not differ, respectively, between standard and decline squats.",
        "Antisense transcription, yielding both coding and non-coding RNA, is a widespread phenomenon in mammals. The mechanism by which natural antisense transcripts (NAT) may regulate gene expression are largely unknown. The aim of the present study was to explore the mechanism of reciprocal sense-antisense (S-AS) regulation by studying the effects of a coding and non-coding NAT on corresponding gene expression, and to investigate the possible involvement of endogenous RNA interference (RNAi) in S-AS interactions.\n\nWe have examined the mechanism of S-AS RNA base pairing, using thymidylate synthase and hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha as primary examples of endogenous genes with coding and non-coding NAT partners, respectively. Here we provide direct evidence against S-AS RNA duplex formation in the cytoplasm of human cells and subsequent activation of RNAi.",
        "In large randomized trials, carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for asymptomatic stenosis has shown a net benefit compared with best medical treatment. To justify an increased number of procedures for this indication, the perioperative risk of stroke or death must not exceed that of the trials. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome in routine clinical practice in Sweden in a population-based study.\n\nThe Swedish Vascular Registry (Swedvasc) covers all centers performing CEA. Data on all registered CEAs during 1994 to 2003 were analyzed both for the whole time period and for two 5-year periods to study alterations over time. Four validation procedures of the registry were performed. Medical records were reviewed for both a random sample and a target sample (a total of 12% of the CEAs for asymptomatic stenosis). Swedvasc data were cross-matched with the In-Patient-Registry (used for reimbursement) and the Population-registry (death).\n\nA total of 6182 CEAs were registered, 671 being for asymptomatic stenosis. In the validation process, no missed registration of major stroke or death was found. Patients with asymptomatic stenosis had, when the whole time-period was analyzed, a perioperative combined stroke or death rate of 2.1%. Outcome improved over time; the combined stroke or death rate decreased from 3.3% (11/330) from 1994 to 1998 to 0.9% (3/341) from 1999 to 2003 (P = .026). During the second time period, no patient with a perioperative major stroke or death was reported.",
        "Management strategy for the postoperative Norwood neonate has been formulated from models that have estimated oxygen consumption (VO2). Superior vena caval oxygen saturation (SVO2), systemic arterial and superior vena caval oxygen saturation difference (Sa-VO2), and oxygen excess factor (Omega = arterial oxygen saturation/Sa-VO2) have been used as indirect indicators to estimate systemic blood flow (Qs) and oxygen delivery (DO2). We sought to examine the correlation of the indirect indicators to VO2-derived measures of oxygen transport.\n\nRespiratory mass spectrometry was used to continuously measure VO2 after the Norwood procedure (n = 13). Measured saturations and the direct Fick equation were used to obtain pulmonary blood flow, Qs, DO2, and oxygen extraction ratio (ERO2) values. Correlations to SVO2, Sa-VO2, and Omega were sought.\n\nThere was a close correlation of SVO2, Sa-VO2, and Omega to ERO2 (r = 0.92, 0.96, and 0.97, respectively; P < .0001). Correlation to Qs and DO2 was variable (r = 0.39 to 0.78, respectively; P < .0001). Correlation to VO2 was poor but significant (r = 0.24 to 0.40, P < .0001). Inclusion of VO2 improved the correlation to Qs and DO2 (r = 0.66 to 0.97, P < .0001).",
        "We examined if age of onset of psychiatric symptoms and/or sex predict conversion to non-affective or affective psychosis in individuals considered to be at ultra-high risk for schizophrenia.\n\nParticipants (n=86) were offered treatment and monthly follow-up until transition to psychosis, or for 12 months if they did not meet exit criteria for psychotic disorder. Individuals without transition to psychosis at 12-month were reassessed approximately 3 years after the end of the treatment phase. Ultra-high risk was defined by the presence of subthreshold and/or self-limiting psychotic symptoms and/or having a family history of psychotic disorder combined with functional decline. Cox regressions after adjustment for treatment interventions were applied to investigate associations between age of onset, sex, and other baseline measures with progression to psychotic outcomes.\n\nEarly age of onset of psychiatric symptoms, in particular onset before age 18 was the only tested variable that significantly predicted non-affective psychosis. Independent significant predictors of affective psychosis were poor functioning, female sex and the presence of a combination of intake criteria (family history of psychosis plus drop in functioning, and attenuated and/or brief limited psychotic symptoms) at baseline.",
        "HIV/AIDS pandemic brought into focus the importance of safe blood donor pool.\n\nTo analyze true seroprevalence of HIV infection in our blood donors and devise an algorithm for donor recall avoiding unnecessary referrals to voluntary counseling and testing centre (VCTC).\n\n39,784 blood units were screened for anti-HIV 1/2 using ELISA immunoassay (IA-1). Samples which were repeat reactive on IA-1 were further tested using two different immunoassays (IA-2 and IA-3) and Western blot (WB). Based on results of these sequential IAs and WB, an algorithm for recall of true HIV seroreactive blood donors is suggested for countries like India where nucleic acid testing or p24 antigen assays are not mandatory and given the limited resources may not be feasible.\n\nThe anti-HIV seroreactivity by repeat IA-1, IA-2, IA-3 and WB were 0.16%, 0.11%, 0.098% and 0.07% respectively. Of the 44 IA-1 reactive samples, 95.2% (20/21) of the seroreactive samples by both IA-2 and IA-3 were also WB positive and 100% (6/6) of the non-reactive samples by these IAs were WB negative. IA signal/cutoff ratio was significantly low in biological false reactive donors. WB indeterminate results were largely due to non-specific reactivity to gag protein (p55).",
        "The polymorphisms of peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor-gamma2 (PPAR-gamma2) have been suggested to affect glucose metabolism and weight gain. Both conditions show great variations during pregnancy that makes pregnancy a suitable condition to detect any metabolic abnormalities related to PPAR-gamma2 polymorphisms. The objective of this study is to investigate the prevalence and metabolic impacts of PPAR-gamma2 polymorphism in control pregnant women and in patients with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).\n\nIn this case-control study, anthropometric and metabolic variables of 100 non-diabetic pregnant women and of 62 women who were diagnosed as having GDM according to 100 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were compared on the basis of PPAR-gamma2 polymorphism by univariate analysis of covariance.\n\nThere were no statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics and the mean 50 g glucose challenge test values of pregnant women in both groups on the basis of PPAR-gamma2 genotype, although patients with Pro12Ala polymorphism were significantly taller in GDM group. The Pro12Ala polymorphism had no effect on 100 g OGTT results of patients with GDM. However, patients with GDM who had Pro12Ala polymorphism gained significantly more weight during their pregnancy.",
        "Data are unavailable for rational selection of pulse sequences to assess postinfarction myocardial viability in rodents at high field strength. We implemented a widely used clinical inversion recovery (IR) sequence at 4.7T and compared the results to a heavily T1-weighted cine FLASH sequence (T1-CF) for assessment of infarction size.\n\nEleven infarcted rats were examined within 24 h of infarction after injection of Gadophrin-3 contrast agent. Images were acquired using both pulse sequences and a standard cine (SC) sequence. Estimates of infarct size were compared to TTC. Global LV function was compared between the T1-CF and SC sequences.\n\nSNR, relative SNR, and CNR for the infarcted and normal myocardium were significantly greater for the IR sequence. Infarction size was overestimated by both sequences, but correlated highly and showed very close agreement with TTC. Global function revealed no significant differences between T1-CF and SC.",
        "To evaluate the accuracy of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology of palpable inguinal lymphadenopathy before definitive management of the primary tumour, in predicting inguinal lymph node (LN) metastasis in men with primary squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the penis.\n\nSixteen men with primary SCC of the penis and palpable inguinal lymphadenopathy (unilateral or bilateral) were treated by primary resection and bilateral inguinal LN dissection. FNA cytology was analysed for 25 palpable inguinal LNs at the time of penile biopsy. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of FNA cytology was compared with the histological findings from surgical LN clearance.\n\nThe 25 FNAs were without complication and without evidence of implantation of metastasis in the needle tracts; 14 FNA samples were positive for metastasis, 10 were negative, and one was inconclusive. From the histological assessment of the surgical inguinal LN specimens, FNA cytology had a sensitivity of 93%, and specificity of 91% in predicting metastatic disease.",
        "To evaluate the relationship between prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) expression level in transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the urinary bladder and various clinicopathological features, including stage and grade; and to determine whether PSCA mRNA expression predicts disease recurrence in superficial (not muscle-invasive) TCC of the bladder.\n\nReal-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed on 97 TCC tissue samples and in 36 samples of normal bladder urothelium; the findings were analysed in relation to clinicopathological factors. Immunohistochemical expression was examined using light and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy to validate the RT-PCR data.\n\nTwenty-seven patients developed disease recurrence, while the remaining 22 had no evidence of recurrence of superficial TCC of the bladder. There was significantly higher PSCA mRNA expression in TCC than in normal urothelium samples (P = 0.008). Superficial (TaT1) tumours had significantly higher PSCA expression than muscle-invasive (> or = pT2) tumours (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference between patients with G1-2 tumours and those with G3 tumours (P = 0.109). Immunohistochemical analysis showed markedly greater PSCA expression in superficial than invasive TCC. Notably, from a multivariate analysis, the expression level of PSCA was an independent predictor of disease recurrence in superficial TCC (P = 0.012).",
        "Clarification of the mechanisms underlying the development of food-sensitive intestinal inflammation will provide an important clue to combating food allergies.\n\nTo establish a model of intestinal inflammation caused by oral administration of antigen without additional treatments, we focused on the ovalbumin (OVA) 23-3 T-cell receptor transgenic mouse, which had been reported to have high serum antigen-specific IgE responses to the feeding of an egg white diet.\n\nChanges in body weight of mice fed an egg white diet were monitored throughout the 28-day experimental period. After the 28-day feeding, intestinal tissues were harvested for histologic examination. Endogenous production of cytokines and histamine in the jejunum, and production of cytokines secreted by OVA-specific CD4+ T cells purified from mesenteric lymph nodes, were analyzed.\n\nEgg white diet-fed OVA23-3 mice developed weight loss and inflammation with villous atrophy and goblet cell hyperplasia, especially in the jejunum. A further characteristic feature was evidence of weight recovery and tissue repair. Jejunal inflammation was also observed in egg white diet-fed recombination activating gene (RAG)-2-deficient OVA23-3 mice. In addition, tissue sections revealed significant infiltration of specific IgE-positive cells and IgE-positive degranulating mast cells. Higher levels of IL-4 and significant levels of histamine were detected in the tissues. In the supernatant of OVA-stimulated T cells, IL-10 levels were also markedly elevated.",
        "Hyaluronan (HA) is a ubiquitous component of the extracellular matrix. HA and its derivatives have been used in the sinuses to reduce scarring and possibly promote wound healing. However, in recent animal studies, HA esters exhibited inflammatory effects. Mitomycin C (MMC) is another potential antiscarring treatment. This study prospectively evaluated the effects of three different HA constructs on wound healing in the rabbit maxillary sinus: (i) a novel cross-linked HA hydrogel, (ii) the cross-linked HA gel containing covalently bound MMC, and (iii) a commercially available woven HA ester (Merogel).\n\nOstia were created with a 4-mm otologic drill in the maxillary sinuses of 15 New Zealand white rabbits with one side randomly chosen for treatment. After 14 or 21 days the size of the maxillary ostia were recorded and the tissue was examined under light microscopy.\n\nSinuses treated with the novel HA and HA-MMC hydrogels showed an increased ostial diameter compared with untreated controls. Woven HA ester-treated sinuses showed no improvement, with a trend toward a smaller ostium than controls. Histological examination showed that woven HA ester tended to cause increased fibrosis and granulomatous inflammation, and heterophilia was slightly increased in the HA hydrogel-treated sinuses. Blinded observation noted foamy macrophages surrounding the residual woven HA ester in each specimen while no similar reaction was noted near the residual HA or HA-MMC hydrogels.",
        "Severe injury to the liver, such as that induced by toxic doses of acetaminophen, triggers a cascade of events leading to hepatocyte death. It is hypothesized that activation of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) might contribute to acetaminophen-induced liver toxicity by virtue of its ability to generate reactive oxygen species, at least in part via nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, and thereby activate downstream signaling pathways leading to cellular injury.\n\nA model was employed in which toxic doses of acetaminophen (1125 mg/kg) were administered to C57BL/6 mice. To block RAGE, mice received murine soluble (s) RAGE, the extracellular ligand binding domain of the receptor that acts as a decoy to interrupt ligand-RAGE signaling.\n\nAnimals treated with sRAGE displayed increased survival compared with vehicle treatment, and markedly decreased hepatic necrosis. Consistent with an important role for RAGE-triggered oxidant stress in acetaminophen-induced injury, a significant reduction of nitrotyrosine protein adducts was observed in hepatic tissue in sRAGE-treated versus vehicle-treated mice receiving acetaminophen, in parallel with significantly increased levels of glutathione. In addition, pro-regenerative cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 were increased in sRAGE-treated versus vehicle-treated mice.",
        "To report on recent studies on the effect of inhaled corticosteroids on pulmonary function in young children with asthma.\n\nInhaled corticosteroids are considered the most effective treatment for persistent asthma in children. Appropriate control of childhood asthma may prevent more serious disease or irreversible obstruction in later years. While some authors have described an improvement with the use of inhaled corticosteroids in young children, others found no clinical or functional benefit. Various studies have shown that inhaled corticosteroids ameliorate clinical outcomes, and recently a study demonstrated improvement in pulmonary function in young children with asthma. The use of different study designs may explain the lack of consistent results and disagreement regarding the efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids in these patients.",
        "Weight maintenance within normal standards is recommended for prevention of conditions associated with oxidative injury. To compare oxidative damage in a post mitotic tissue, between adults differing in long-term energy balance.\n\nDuring hernia surgery, a sample of skeletal muscle was obtained in 17 non-obese adults. Subjects were divided into two groups according to their self-reported weight change: weight maintainers (WM) reported <4kg increase, and weight gainers (WG) reported >5kg increment. Muscle immunohistochemistry for 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8OHdG), 4-Hydroxy-2-nonenal (4HNE), and TNF-alpha, as markers of oxidative injury and inflammation, were performed. As known positive controls for oxidative injury, we included 10 elderly subjects (66-101yr). Anthropometric measures and blood samples for clinical laboratory and serum cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-6) were obtained.\n\n8OHdG was higher in WG compared with WM (149.1+/-16.2 versus 117.8+/-29.5, P=0.03), and was associated with anthropometric indicators of fat accumulation. 4HNE was similar in WG compared with WM (10.9+/-7.6 versus 9.8+/-6.3) but noticeably higher in elderly subjects (21.5+/-15.3, P=0.059). TNF-alpha protein in WG was higher compared with WM (114.0+/-41.7 versus 70.1+/-23.3, P=0.025), and was associated with weight increase.",
        "Elemental diets (EDs) have been used successfully in treatment of some intestinal inflammatory diseases; however, the mechanism that mediates their effects is still unclear. In this study we evaluated the immunological effect of enteral administration of an ED in mice.\n\nC57BL/6 mice were fed an ED (El-Diet) from weaning up to adulthood and immunological parameters were analyzed.\n\nEl-Diet-fed mice presented an underdeveloped gut-associated-lymphoid tissue with lower numbers of TCRalphabeta+IELs and lamina propria cells and low levels of secretory IgA when compared to chow-fed mice. They showed a systemic decrease in the production of IgG and IgA as well as a skewing towards a Th2 profile of cytokine production upon in vitro stimulation with an increase in IL-4 and a reduction in IFN-gamma and IL-6 secretion.",
        "Segmented inversion recovery (IR) ratio imaging (SIRRIM) has been established as a sensitive tool to assess neurodegeneration of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SN(C)) in patients with idiopathic Parkinson disease (IPD). The obtained results suggest the possibility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a biological marker for IPD. The strength and a parsimonious analysis of the technique are discussed to assess the potential of using MRI as a biological marker for IPD and improve the differential diagnosis of sporadic Parkinson disease. Our hypothesis states that the magnetic resonance SIRRIM technique allows direct visualization and quantitation of neural cell loss in the SN(C) and therefore could become a reliable biological marker for Parkinson disease. To achieve this goal, some key aspects of data acquisition and data analysis need to be addressed. The clinical impact of the SIRRIM technique could be considerable, considering that it might become a viable surrogate to other techniques.\n\nTwelve patients with IPD and 12 age-matched control subjects were imaged by using the SIRRIM technique based on two IR imaging sequences that were designed to suppress white and gray matter to assess loss of neural cells in situ by means of a ratio image (white matter suppressed image to gray matter suppressed image). The radiological index was correlated with the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) for patients with IPD.\n\nAll patients with IPD were identified correctly, and full dichotomization between healthy volunteers and patients was obtained with our database. Our SIRRIM technique shows that it can be used to rule out Parkinson disease from essential tremor and other forms of Parkinsonism, such as progressive supranuclear palsy and multisystem atrophy. In addition, it is sensitive enough to identify patients with early-stage IPD.",
        "The main goal of this study was to evaluate if the edge-to-edge mitral repair could be a limiting factor for exercise tolerance and to compare these results to those of classical techniques.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2002, 54 consecutive patients were operated on for mitral valve regurgitation (MR). Twenty-five patients were operated with Alfieri\"s technique (group A) and 29 patients with Carpentier\"s technique (group C). The mean age was 63.9 years in group A and 63.8 years in group C (p = 0.98). After a mean follow-up of 16.2+/-12 months, survivor patients were seen at the outpatient clinic, by the same physician for a clinical evaluation, an echocardiogram at rest and at peak exercise, and received a cardiorespiratory exercise testing with maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max) recording.\n\nClinical status improved with 0% of the patients in class NYHA III or IV in either group postoperatively versus 77% preoperatively. There was no significant MR in 80% of cases in group A versus 89.6% in group C (p = 0.54). The mean mitral valve area was 2.5 and 2.9 cm2 in groups A and C, respectively (p = 0.018). The mitral gradient at rest was 3.8 and 3.3 mmHg (p = 0.31) and the mitral gradient at peak exercise was 8.5 and 9.7 mmHg (p = 0.22) in groups A and C, respectively. Cardiorespiratory exercise testing showed a mean VO2 max of 73.7+/-15% of normal value in group A versus 79.6+/-13.1% in group C (p = 0.18).",
        "Integrin recognition of fibronectin is required for normal gastrulation including the mediolateral cell intercalation behaviors that drive convergent extension and the elongation of the frog dorsal axis; however, the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved are unclear.\n\nWe report that depletion of fibronectin with antisense morpholinos blocks both convergent extension and mediolateral protrusive behaviors in explant preparations. Both chronic depletion of fibronectin and acute disruptions of integrin alpha5beta1 binding to fibronectin increases the frequency and randomizes the orientation of polarized cellular protrusions, suggesting that integrin-fibronectin interactions normally repress frequent random protrusions in favor of fewer mediolaterally oriented ones. In the absence of integrin alpha5beta1 binding to fibronectin, convergence movements still occur but result in convergent thickening instead of convergent extension.",
        "The present investigation was initiated to examine the weight management practices among wrestlers participating in the NCAA Division I, II, and III wrestling tournaments. Part 1 examined the efficacy of body composition assessment between preseason (PRE) and postseason (POST). Part 2 examined rapid weight loss (RWL) during the 20 h preceding the weigh-in and the rapid weight gained (RWG) during the first day\"s competition.\n\nSubjects include 811 competitors from Divisions I, II, and III participating in the NCAA national championship tournaments between 1999 and 2004. Measurements included relative body fatness (% BF) and weight (WT) on the day preceding the tournament and the evening of the first day. Minimal weight (MW) was computed with 5% BF. Retrospectively, MW, % BF, and WT from the previous fall were obtained for comparisons from NCAA records.\n\nPart 1: WT and % BF decreased significantly PRE (WT 74.0 +/- 11.1 kg; % BF 12.3 +/- 3.4%) to POST (WT 71.5 +/- 10.4 kg; % BF 9.5 +/- 1.8%), but MW (PRE MW 68.0 +/- 9.2 kg, POST MW 67.9 +/- 9.1 kg) remained unchanged. Heavier wrestlers and Division I and II wrestlers showed the greatest changes in WT and % BF. Part 2: RWL averaged (+/- SD) 1.2 +/- 0.9 kg and relative to weight 1.7 +/- 1.2%. Division I and lighter wrestlers showed the greatest change. RWG averaged 0.9 +/- 0.8 kg, or 1.3 +/- 1.2%. RWG was greater among lighter and Division I and II wrestlers.",
        "Low-dosage adrenaline contained in local anesthetics is commonly used for hemostasis during functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS), but often causes significant hemodynamic side effects that might be neglected. A randomized, controlled, prospective clinical trial was designed to find out these effects after local infiltration of different concentrations and/or different dosages of adrenaline during FESS under general anesthesia.\n\nOne hundred eight adult patients were randomized into one of four groups to receive 2 mL of 2% lidocaine and adrenaline 1:200,000 (group I), 4 mL of 1% lidocaine and adrenaline 1:400,000 (group II), 4 mL of 1% lidocaine and adrenaline 1:200,000 (group III), or 4 mL of 1% lidocaine (group IV) for local infiltration, respectively. Heart rate, systolic blood pressure (BP), diastolic BP, and mean arterial pressure were monitored continuously in radial artery.\n\nSignificant hemodynamic changes, particularly decrease of BP (p < 0.001) with slightly increased heart rate (p < 0.001) approximately 1.5 minutes after local infiltration, were observed in group I, group II, and group III compared with the baseline, but not in group IV. However, no significant hemodynamic changes were observed between group I, group II, and group III at the same time points (p > 0.05).",
        "Several studies have shown that sectioning bundles of collagen fibers in the marginal gingiva during surgical procedures in animals is a distinct stimulus for alveolar bone resorption. Normally, gingival and periodontal fibroblasts, which reside on these collagen fibers, create physiological traction forces generated by the cytoskeleton. By splitting the fibers, traction forces are released, inducing changes in the cytoskeleton and cell shape. In this study, four drugs were selected, including cytochalasin D, EDTA, sodium orthovanadate, and H-7, all influencing the cytoskeleton-integrin-extracellular matrix (ECM) pathway, for their ability to reduce alveolar bone loss by local application.\n\nThe drugs were applied locally only once at the site of mucoperiosteal flap surgery in a rat model. Cytochalasin D (1 microl/microl), EDTA (0.24 mg/microl), sodium orthovanadate (0.02 mg/microl), and H-7 (0.10 microl/microl), each separately, were carried by a protective paste and placed immediately after elevating the flap. The analysis of alveolar bone loss was performed 3 weeks after surgery by scanning the microradiographic films of the mandible cross-sections. The percentages of cross sections with no, moderate, or severe bone loss in treated in comparison to non-treated rats are presented.\n\nEDTA, sodium orthovanadate, and H-7 were significantly effective in reducing alveolar bone loss. They were effective in reducing the amount of severe bone loss by 53%, 20%, and 58% while increasing the number of sections with no bone loss by 25%, 23%, and 35%, respectively. Cytochalasin D reduced alveolar bone loss insignificantly.",
        "The portacaval anastamosis (PCA) rat is a model of the nutritional and endocrine consequences of liver cirrhosis. We hypothesized that failure to gain body weight in the PCA rat was the consequence of low testosterone levels and will be reversed by 4-hydroxyandrostenedione, a specific aromatase inhibitor.\n\nMale Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to an end-to-side PCA or sham surgery were administered either 4-hydroxyandrostenedione or vehicle. Food intake, food efficiency, and body weight were measured, animals sacrificed 3 weeks after surgery, visceral organs harvested and plasma sex steroids measured. Hepatic RNA was extracted and dot blots done to quantify the expression of sex hormone dependent enzymes 16alpha hydroxylase and 15beta hydroxylase.\n\nGrowth, food intake, food efficiency and plasma testosterone were lower and plasma estradiol higher in PCA than sham rats. Hepatic expression of testosterone driven 16alpha hydroxylase was lower and estradiol driven 15beta hydroxylase higher in PCA rats. These alterations were reversed by 4-hydroxyandrostenedione.",
        "It has been proposed that social and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia may result from impaired error monitoring.\n\nWe tested the hypothesis that among schizophrenia patients, impaired error monitoring contributes to poor face recognition, an important social skill.\n\n79 schizophrenia patients and 57 healthy individuals were administered a computerized face recognition test which allowed collection of accuracy and latency performance parameters. Error monitoring was assessed by analyzing reaction times for correct (RTC) and incorrect (RTI) responses. Tests of working memory (WM) and processing speed were also administered.\n\nRTI was longer than RTC in patients and controls and did not differ between the groups. RTC was significantly longer in patients than controls. Error monitoring effort, calculated by dividing the difference between RTI and RTC by the sum of RTC and RTI, was significantly smaller in patients than controls. A regression model with face recognition performance as dependent variable showed independent contributions of error monitoring effort, spatial working memory and group (patient/healthy) to test performance and explained 26.1% of the variance.",
        "Antibodies against the Ass peptide clear Ass deposits when injected intracranially. Deglycosylated antibodies have reduced effector functions compared to their intact counterparts, potentially avoiding immune activation.\n\nDeglycosylated or intact C-terminal specific high affinity anti-Abeta antibody (2H6) were intracranially injected into the right frontal cortex and hippocampus of amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice. The untreated left hemisphere was used to normalize for the extent of amyloid deposition present in each mouse. Control transgenic mice were injected with an antibody against a drosophila-specific protein (amnesiac). Tissues were examined for brain amyloid deposition and microglial responses 3 days after the injection.\n\nThe deglycosylated 2H6 antibody had lower affinity for several murine Fcgamma receptors and human complement than intact 2H6 without a change in affinity for Ass. Immunohistochemistry for Abeta and thioflavine-S staining revealed that both diffuse and compact deposits were reduced by both antibodies. In animals treated with the intact 2H6 antibody, a significant increase in Fcgamma-receptor II/III immunostaining was observed compared to animals treated with the control IgG antibody. No increase in Fcgamma-receptor II/III was found with the deglycosylated 2H6 antibody. Immunostaining for the microglial activation marker CD45 demonstrated a similar trend.",
        "To investigate the effect of verapamil on Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cytokines [tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-10 (IL-10)] and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) in the liver.\n\nAdult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into seven groups of eight rats each: control rats treated with saline (0.9 % NaCl); rats treated with saline and then challenged intraperitoneally with LPS (10 mg/kg); rats treated intraperitoneally with different levels of verapamil (1, 2.5, 5, 10 mg/kg) and then challenged with LPS (10 mg/kg); and rats treated only with verapamil (10 mg/kg). TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-10 and NF-kappa B in the liver tissues were investigated as well as the serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) one hour after LPS injection.\n\nLPS alone stimulated production of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-10, and activated NF-kappa B in the liver. Pretreatment with verapamil before LPS challenge reduced acute liver injury, down-regulated production of LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha and IL-6), up-regulated production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10) and inhibited NF-kappa B activation in the liver in a dose-dependent manner.",
        "Anti-CD45 antibody exhibits multiple biological effects on human mononuclear cells (MNC) and polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN). We intended to determine whether anti-CD45 antibody could affect arachidonic acid metabolism and thereby, the interactions between human na\u00efve MNC and PMN.\n\nHuman na\u00efve MNC and PMN were incubated with monoclonal anti-human CD45 IgG F(ab\")(2) antibody or non-specific IgG F(ab\")(2) for 30 min. The mRNA expression of cyclooxygenase type 1 (COX-1), type 2 (COX-2), 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) and leukotriene A(4) hydrolase (LTA(4) hydrolase) in both cells was detected by RT-PCR and quantified by densitometric determination. The presence of COX-1 and COX-2 molecules in the cells was detected by Western blot. The concentration of PGE(2) and LTB(4) in cultured supernatants was measured by EIA kits.\n\nAnti-CD45 IgG F(ab\")(2) up-regulated LTA(4) hydrolase mRNA expression and LTB(4) production, but down-regulated COX-1 and COX-2 mRNA expression and PGE2 production, of na\u00efve MNC compared to non-specific IgG F(ab\")(2). In contrast, a reverse modulation by the specific antibody on PMN was observed including up-regulation of cyclooxygenase pathway and down-regulation of lipoxygenase pathway.",
        "Short-term habituation of the startle response represents an elementary form of learning in mammals. The underlying mechanism is located within the primary startle pathway, presumably at sensory synapses on giant neurons in the caudal pontine reticular nucleus (PnC). Short trains of action potentials in sensory afferent fibers induce depression of synaptic responses in PnC giant neurons, a phenomenon that has been proposed to be the cellular correlate for short-term habituation. We address here the question whether both this synaptic depression and the short-term habituation of the startle response are localized at the presynaptic terminals of sensory afferents. If this is confirmed, it would imply that these processes take place prior to multimodal signal integration, rather than occurring at postsynaptic sites on PnC giant neurons that directly drive motor neurons.\n\nPatch-clamp recordings in vitro were combined with behavioral experiments; synaptic depression was specific for the input pathway stimulated and did not affect signals elicited by other sensory afferents. Concordant with this, short-term habituation of the acoustic startle response in behavioral experiments did not influence tactile startle response amplitudes and vice versa. Further electrophysiological analysis showed that the passive properties of the postsynaptic neuron were unchanged but revealed some alterations in short-term plasticity during depression. Moreover, depression was induced only by trains of presynaptic action potentials and not by single pulses. There was no evidence for transmitter receptor desensitization. In summary, the data indicates that the synaptic depression mechanism is located presynaptically.",
        "The aim was to evaluate familial early-onset cardiovascular disorders as potential risk factors for severe preeclampsia.\n\nA case-control study was carried out by interviewing 162 primiparous severely preeclamptic women and 521 primiparous healthy control patients after delivery to determine the frequency of cardiovascular disorders (chronic hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke) developed before the age of 50 among their parents. The chi2-test was utilized to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). The association was adjusted for pre-pregnancy body mass index, maternal age, and smoking habits before pregnancy using logistic regression analysis.\n\nMaternal and paternal early-onset chronic hypertension (adjusted OR: 3.84, 95% CI: 2.25-6.54; and adjusted OR: 3.26, 95% CI: 1.76-6.05) as well as paternal early-onset myocardial infarction (adjusted OR: 3.33; 95% CI: 1.51-7.32) were independent risk factors for severe preeclampsia. Early-onset stroke affected only the fathers of severely preeclamptic patients. Among the severely preeclamptic patients a positive family history of cardiovascular disorders developed before the age of 50 increased the risk of early-onset preeclampsia (developing before the 32nd gestational week) by 5.05-fold (95% CI: 3.08-8.31) compared with the control group.",
        "The aim of this study was to investigate the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for non-invasive measurement of rectal cancer angiogenesis and hypoxia.\n\nFifteen patients with rectal adenocarcinoma underwent preoperative dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) and blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) MRI. Microvessel density (CD31 level), and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and carbonic anhydrase (CA) 9 were measured immunohistochemically in histological tumour sections from 12 patients. Serum VEGF levels were also measured in 14 patients. Correlations between quantitative imaging indices and immunohistochemical variables were examined.\n\nThere was good correlation between circulating VEGF and CD31 expression (r(S) = 0.88, P < 0.001). CD31 expression did not correlate with any dynamic MRI parameter, except transfer constant, with which it correlated inversely (r(S) = -0.65, P = 0.022). Tissue and circulating VEGF levels did not correlate, and neither correlated with any tumour DCE MRI parameter. No relationship was seen between BOLD MRI and CA-9 expression.",
        "Lung compliance has been found to be low in patients with chronic diaphragmatic weakness or paralysis but has not been well-studied in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NPPV) prolongs survival in ALS patients but may also have additional beneficial effects.\n\nThis study evaluated static expiratory lung compliance (CL) in subjects with ALS and determined the effect of lung inflation with supramaximal inflation on CL.\n\nThis was a prospective trial comparing CL before and after supramaximal lung inflation via mouthpiece-delivered positive pressure.\n\nA single university medical center with an multidisciplinary ALS center.\n\nFourteen subjects with ALS were compared to 4 healthy volunteers.\n\nSubjects underwent a battery of pulmonary function tests including for CL. Then they used positive pressure administered via a mouthpiece set to 10 cm H2O above their maximal static recoil pressure for 5 min. The CL measurement was then repeated.\n\nThe mean (+/- SD) baseline CL was reduced (164.1 +/- 82.1 mL/cm H2O) in subjects with ALS and was significantly lower than that in healthy volunteers (237.5 mL/cm H2O; p = 0.04). CL increased significantly in subjects with evidence of diaphragm weakness (change in CL, 11.3 +/- 16.7 mL/cm H2O; p = 0.03). Healthy volunteers did not have an increase in CL.",
        "Using bone marrow transplantation, we assessed the impact of macrophage-derived phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) on lesion development in hypercholesterolemic mice that expressed either normal levels of mouse apolipoprotein AI (apoAI) or elevated levels of only human apoAI.\n\nBone marrow transplantations were performed in low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice (LDLr-/-) that expressed either normal levels of mouse apoAI (msapoAI) or high levels of only human apoAI (msapoAI-/-, LDLr-/-, huapoAITg). Mice were lethally irradiated, reconstituted with either PLTP-expressing or PLTP-deficient bone marrow cells, and fed a high-fat diet over 16 weeks. Macrophage PLTP deficiency increased atherosclerosis in LDLr-/- mice with minimal changes in total plasma cholesterol levels. In contrast, the extent of atherosclerosis in msapoAI-/-, LDLr-/-, huapoAITg mice was not significantly different between groups that had received PLTP-/- or PLTP+/+ bone marrow. In vitro studies indicated that PLTP deficiency led to a significant decrease in alpha-tocopherol content and increased oxidative stress in bone marrow cells.",
        "Foam cells perform critical functions in atherosclerosis. We hypothesize that coronary segments with superficial foam cells (SFCs) situated in a region of interest with a depth of 200 mum can be identified using intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy (IFS) and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). This is a key step in our ongoing program to develop a spectroscopic technique for real-time in vivo diagnosis of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque.\n\nWe subjected 132 human coronary segments to in vitro IFS and DRS. We detected SFCs in 13 thick fibrous cap atheromas and 8 pathologic intimal thickening (PIT) lesions. SFCs colocalized with accumulations of smooth muscle cells and proteoglycans, including hyaluronan (P<0.001). Two spectroscopic parameters were generated from analysis of IFS at 480 nm excitation and DRS. A discriminatory algorithm using these parameters identified specimens with SFC area >40%, 20%, 10%, 5%, 2.5%, and 0% of the region of interest with 98%, 98%, 93%, 94%, 93%, and 90% accuracy, respectively.",
        "Analysis of a precision grip-lift task provides measures to assess functional disability of the hand, but the correlation between these measures and accepted tests of motor function in stroke patients has not been established.\n\nSeventeen subacute stroke patients were studied to compare parameters of a precision grip-lift task between the affected and unaffected side, and to correlate them with function. Functional impairment was assessed with the Action Research Arm Test and the Fugl-Meyer assessment, as well as grip strength and maximal finger-tapping speed. The grip force (GF) and load force (LF) were recorded as patients lifted a custom-built manipulandum. All measures were recorded on two separate occasions, at least 1 week apart.\n\nThere was good reproducibility between testing sessions for the grip-lift and functional measures. The affected hand gripped the manipulandum for longer prior to lift-off than the unaffected hand, and the normal close temporal coupling between the rate of change of GF and LF during the lift was disrupted. These two measures correlated more highly with the ARAT than the FMA and, when combined with measures of grip strength and tapping speed, explained 71% of the variance of the ARAT.",
        "This study was performed to determine the location of the natural ostium of the sphenoid sinus relative to the intact superior turbinate.\n\nForty-seven cadaveric specimens were examined. Mucosa over the sphenoethmoidal recess, superior turbinate, and posterior ethmoid was left intact. The position of the sphenoid sinus natural ostium relative to the superior turbinate was identified.\n\nThe sphenoid ostium was identified in all specimens. In all specimens, the sphenoid ostium was found to be medial to the intact superior turbinate, notwithstanding lateral deflection of the posterior few millimeters of the superior turbinate in some cases.",
        "The Gleason index (GI) is related to several pathological endpoints in radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens, including the risk of extraprostatic disease (ED). The amount of tumour (TM) in core biopsy (CB) specimens also correlates with staging. The aim was to determine whether the sum of the relative statistical weights of GI and TM in CBs strengthens the prediction of ED in RPs.\n\nA series of 290 RPs and their previous respective CBs were reviewed. TM and the GI were blindly evaluated in CBs and statistically correlated with ED in RPs. A total of 60 (20.6%) RPs showed ED. The logistic regression model indicated that all cases with > 22 mm of cancer in CB showed ED in RP. All cases with a GI > 7 and > 12 mm of cancer in CB displayed ED. Finally, Pearson\"s chi2 revealed that 80% of cases with a GI > 7 and > or = 5 mm of cancer in CB showed ED in RP.",
        "Chromosomal translocations are causally related to the development of many tumors. In Burkitt\"s lymphoma, abnormalities involving the c-myc gene are essential. The CT-element of the c-myc promoter adopts non-B-conformation in vivo and in vitro, and therefore provides a potential fragile site.\n\nWe have developed a LM-PCR-based approach to test if chromosomal breakpoints indeed cluster in this region.\n\nAmplifying both, wild-type as well as the translocated c-myc gene by LM-PCR, it was shown that chromosomal breakpoints did not cluster within the CT-element.",
        "Photochemical treatment (PCT) for pathogen reduction of platelet concentrates (PCs) affects all cells containing DNA and/or RNA. Soluble mediators, which may cause transfusion reactions, are determined by the balance between secretion and/or cell destruction and binding and/or degradation.\n\nTen double-dose single-donor leukoreduced PCs were split in two identical units. Two study arms were created: Study Arm A consisting of five PCT PCs with corresponding untreated control PCs and Study Arm B consisting of five PCT PCs with corresponding gamma-irradiated control PCs. PCs that had added PAS-III (Intersol) were treated with amotosalen and ultraviolet A light. Corresponding controls PCs, to which PAS-II (T-sol) were added, received no treatment or were gamma-irradiated before storage. Platelet (PLT)-derived (CCL5/RANTES, CXCL4/PF4, CCL3/MIP-1alpha, transforming growth factor [TGF]-beta, CXCL8/interleukin [IL]-8, IL-1beta) as well as white blood cell (WBC)-associated (IL-6, IL-10, IL-11, IL-12, tumor necrosis factor, interferon-gamma) cytokines were investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and cytometric bead array during storage for up to 12 days.\n\nIndependent of previous treatment we observed that all concentrates showed low levels of WBC-associated cytokines. PLT-derived cytokines were detected at higher levels and showed significant increase during storage. Statistical analysis showed lower PLT content per unit in PCT PCs, higher levels of activation variables in PCT PCs, and higher levels and accumulation rate of CCL5, CXCL4, TGF-beta, and CXCL8 in PCT PCs.",
        "Anti-GD2 murine IgG3 antibody 3F8 kills neuroblastoma cells by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) enhances phagocyte-mediated ADCC. The differential affinity of the human FCGR polymorphic alleles for 3F8 may influence the effectiveness of antibody immunotherapy.\n\nThe entire cohort of high risk neuroblastoma patients (N = 136) treated on protocol using 3F8 and GM-CSF were the subjects of this analysis. Tumor response was measured by standard clinical tools plus sensitive molecular monitoring using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Polymorphic alleles of FCGR2A and FCGR3A were determined by PCR plus direct sequencing using genomic DNA samples obtained from marrow or blood of patients.\n\nFCGR2A (R/R) genotype correlated with progression-free survival for the entire cohort (P = .049) and for the subset of patients with no history of prior relapse (P = .023). FCGR2A (R/R) also correlated with marrow remission 2.5 months after treatment initiation: by histology (P = .021 and P = .036, for the entire cohort and the subset, respectively) and by qRT-PCR (P = .052 and P = .033, respectively).",
        "In breast cancer, [(18)F]fluoroestradiol (FES) positron emission tomography (PET) correlates with estrogen receptors (ER) expression and predicts response to tamoxifen. We tested the ability of FES-PET imaging to predict response to salvage hormonal treatment in heavily pretreated metastatic breast cancer patients, predominantly treated with aromatase inhibitors.\n\nInitial FES uptake measurements in 47 patients with ER-positive tumors were correlated with subsequent tumor response to 6 months of hormonal treatment. Most patients had bone dominant disease and prior tamoxifen exposure. Response was compared to initial FES-PET uptake, measured qualitatively and quantitatively using standardized uptake value (SUV) and estradiol-binding flux.\n\nEleven of 47 patients (23%) had an objective response. While no patients with absent FES uptake had a response to treatment, the association between qualitative FES-PET results and response was not significant (P = .14). However, quantitative FES uptake and response were significantly associated; zero of 15 patients with initial SUV less than 1.5 responded to hormonal therapy, compared with 11 of 32 patients (34%) with SUV higher than 1.5 (P < .01). In the subset of patients whose tumors did not overexpress HER2/neu, 11 of 24 patients (46%) with SUV higher than 1.5 responded.",
        "Serum anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) levels provide a powerful means for predicting ovarian response, which is reflected not only by the size of the primordial follicle pool but also by the quality of the oocytes. Considering a mutual interdependence between AMH-expressing somatic cells and gametes, this prospective morphological study was set up to evaluate whether extreme AMH levels represent diminished oocyte quality and developmental incompetence.\n\nA total of 141 consecutive ICSI patients were subdivided into three groups using the 25th and 75th percentiles of the serum AMH levels (cycle day 3). In these three groups, morphology of all oocytes and fertilization rate, embryo quality and blastocyst formation were evaluated, and FSH, LH and estradiol (E(2)) levels were also measured.\n\nCycle cancellation rate was correlated with AMH levels (P < 0.05). AMH groups 1 (<1.66 ng/ml) and 3 (>4.52 ng/ml) showed oocytes of lower quality [dark central granulation, aggregation of smooth endoplasmic reticulum (sER)] compared with the median group 2 (1.66-4.52 ng/ml). Basal serum FSH did not allow for adequate prognosis in terms of gamete appearance. Fertilization and further cleavage up to blastocyst stage was not affected by AMH levels.",
        "Overexpression of beta III tubulin has been involved in paclitaxel resistance in several experimental models. We investigated the role of beta III tubulin as predictor of clinical outcome in ovarian cancer patients given platinum/paclitaxel treatment. We also investigated whether beta III tubulin expression could be modified after the selective pressure represented by chemotherapy in vivo.\n\nThe study was designed to include a series of consecutive ovarian cancer patients with unresectable disease at time of first surgery, who underwent interval debulking surgery with pathologic assessment of response to treatment with platinum/paclitaxel chemotherapy. Immunostaining was done on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections from pretreatment and posttreatment tissue biopsies by using the polyclonal rabbit anti-class III beta-tubulin antibody.\n\nbeta III Tubulin immunoreaction was observed in 51 of 62 (82.2%) cases. beta III Tubulin positivity was neither associated with clinicopathologic variables nor with pathologic response to chemotherapy. Significantly lower percentages of beta III tubulin positivity were observed in posttreatment (range, 5-80%; median, 20%) versus pretreatment (range 10-100%; median, 40%) tissue biopsies (P = 0.0011). Cases with high beta III tubulin expression showed a worse overall survival with respect to cases with low beta III tubulin expression (median overall survival, 25 versus 46 months; P = 0.002). Multivariate analysis showed that high content of beta III tubulin remains independently associated with a worse prognosis.",
        "This study investigated whether manipulation of cardiovascular drift (CV drift) by changing exercise duration or by fluid ingestion is associated with altered peak oxygen uptake VO(2peak).\n\nVO(2peak) was measured in 11 trained men immediately after they cycled at 60% control VO(2max) in 30 degrees C, 40% relative humidity for 15, 60, and 120 min with no fluid (15 NF, 60 NF, 120 NF) or 120 min with fluid (120 F). Stroke volume (SV), heart rate (HR), and related measures were measured in 120 NF and 120 F at 15, 60, and 120 min.\n\nBody mass decreased 0.7, 2.3, and 3.7% in 120 F, 60 NF, and 120 NF. SV at the end of submaximal exercise and VO(2peak) measured immediately thereafter were reduced significantly (P < 0.05) from 15-min values in 120 NF (13.8 and 8.7%) but not in 60 NF (4.6 and 1.2%) or 120 F (2.1 and 1.9%).",
        "Prostate biopsy (PBX) is being performed more often than ever before for the early detection of prostate cancer, but some patients may have febrile infectious complications after biopsy. The risk factors of infectious complications need to be considered.\n\nWe investigated the pre-biopsy risk factors and febrile infectious complications in 120 patients who underwent PBX in our institution. The pre-biopsy risk factors set were prostate volume (> or = 40 ml), transitional zone (TZ) volume (> or = 20 ml), core number of biopsy (> or = 10 cores), and additional performance of TZ biopsy. We analyzed statistically the correlations between these risk factors and C-reactive protein and peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count elevation on day 1 and day 7 after biopsy.\n\nOur results showed that a prostate volume > or = 40 ml and a TZ volume > or = 20 ml caused a significantly higher elevation of the C-reactive protein level compared with a prostate volume < 40 ml (p = 0.0055 on day 1 and p = 0.0225 on day 7, respectively) on day 1 and day 7, and a TZ volume < 20 ml (p = 0.0008) on day 1. Regarding WBC count, those patients with a prostate volume > or = 40 ml and a TZ volume > or = 20 ml had a tendency to have an elevated WBC count on day 1 compared with those patients with a prostate volume < 40 ml and a TZ volume < 20 ml, and however these changes were not significant.",
        "Coupled to hundreds of receptors, G-proteins modulate signal transduction pathways and are important hormonal targets. The first objective was to determine the effect of pregnancy and estradiol on myometrial guanosine triphosphatase activity. The second objective was to begin dissecting the molecular mechanism(s) underlying alterations in guanosine triphosphatase activity.\n\nMyometrial tissue was obtained from pregnant, nonpregnant, and ovariectomized untreated and estradiol-treated guinea pigs. Myometrial membranes were prepared by homogenization and differential centrifugation. Basal high-affinity specific guanosine triphosphatase activity was quantitated by enzymatic assay and expressed in rhomol 32Pi per milligram protein per minute. Guanosine triphosphatase activity was stimulated using oxytocin, isoproterenol, and prostaglandin F2alpha. Specific G-protein subunits were quantitated using Western blots. G-protein associated gene expression was semiquantitated using HGU133A gene array chips from Affymetrix.\n\nBasal myometrial guanosine triphosphatase activity was increased in pregnant compared with nonpregnant animals. Estradiol increased basal myometrial guanosine triphosphatase activity, compared with untreated controls. The effect of estradiol on stimulated activity was agonist dependent. Both Galphas and Galphai isoform 1 protein levels were increased in myometrium from late pregnant compared with nonpregnant animals. By late gestation, the messenger ribonucleic acid levels of those genes were unaltered, compared with the nonpregnant animal. In general, the impact of pregnancy on G-protein family member gene messenger ribonucleic acid expression was modest. Only the small guanosine triphosphatase Rap1b demonstrated altered expression more than 2-fold during either myometrial quiescence (midpregnancy) or activation (term pregnancy) (up 3-fold during quiescence). Genomic network analyses revealed that the expression of another small guanosine triphosphatase, Rab7, was exclusively up-regulated (80%) during quiescence. During late pregnancy, network analysis showed that only G-protein beta was exclusively altered (up-regulated). Estradiol mimicked the pregnancy effect on both transcription and translation of G-protein family members for some but not all potentially relevant genes.",
        "Loss of sensitivity to TGF-beta1 (transforming growth factor beta1)-induced growth arrest is an important step towards malignant transformation in human epithelial cells, and Id-1 (inhibitor of differentiation or DNA binding-1) has been associated with cell proliferation and cell-cycle progression. Here, we investigated the role of Id-1 in cellular sensitivity to TGF-beta1.\n\nUsing an immortalized prostate epithelial cell line, NPTX cells, we suppressed Id-1 expression through antisense strategy. We found that inhibition of Id-1 expression suppressed cell proliferation and at the same time induced cellular senescence and G2/M cell-cycle arrest. In addition, inactivation of Id-1 made cells more vulnerable to TGF-beta1-induced growth arrest. The sensitization effect on TGF-beta1 was associated with up-regulation of two downstream effectors of the TGF-beta1 pathway, p21WAF1/Cip1 and p27KIP1.",
        "To determine if androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) has an impact on cause-specific, biochemical progression-free, or overall survival after prostate brachytherapy.\n\nFrom April 1995 through June 2002, 938 consecutive patients underwent brachytherapy for clinical Stage T1b to T3a (2002 AJCC) prostate cancer. All patients underwent brachytherapy more than 3 years before analysis. A total of 382 patients (40.7%) received ADT with a duration of 6 months or less in 277 and more than 6 months in 105. The median follow-up was 5.4 years. Multiple clinical, treatment, and dosimetric parameters were evaluated as predictors of cause-specific, biochemical progression-free, and overall survival.\n\nThe 10-year cause-specific, biochemical progression-free, and overall survival rates for the entire cohort were 96.4%, 95.9%, and 78.1%, respectively. Except for biochemical progression-free survival in high-risk patients, ADT did not statistically impact any of the three survival categories. A Cox linear-regression analysis demonstrated that Gleason score was the best predictor of cause-specific survival, whereas percent-positive biopsies, prostate volume, and risk group predicted for biochemical progression-free survival. Patient age and tobacco use were the strongest predictors of overall survival. One hundred two patients have died, with 80 of the deaths a result of cardiovascular disease (54) and second malignancies (26). To date, only 12 patients have died of metastatic prostate cancer.",
        "Sepsis, affecting millions of individuals annually with an associated high mortality rate, is among the top 10 causes of death. In addition, improvements in diagnostic tests for detecting and monitoring sepsis and infection have been limited in the last 25 years. Neutrophil CD64 expression has been proposed as an improved diagnostic test for the evaluation of infection and sepsis.\n\nTo evaluate the diagnostic performance of a quantitative flow cytometric assay for leukocyte CD64 expression in comparison with the standard tests for infection/sepsis in an ambulatory care setting.\n\nProspective analysis of 100 blood samples from patients from an emergency department setting in a 965-bed tertiary care suburban community hospital was performed for neutrophil CD64 expression, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and complete blood count. The laboratory findings were compared with a clinical score for the likelihood of infection/sepsis, which was obtained by a blinded retrospective chart review.\n\nThe diagnostic performance, as gauged by the clinical score, varied with neutrophil CD64 (sensitivity 87.9%, specificity 71.2%, efficiency 76.8%) and outperformed C-reactive protein (sensitivity 88.2%, specificity 59.4%, efficiency 69.4%), absolute neutrophil count (sensitivity 60.0%, specificity 50.8%, efficiency 53.8%), myeloid left shift (sensitivity 68.2%, specificity 76.3%, efficiency 73.3%), and sedimentation rate (sensitivity 50.0%, specificity 65.5%, efficiency 61.0%).",
        "The first aim of this study was to examine the rate, pattern and correlates of inpatient admission during the first 3 months of treatment for first-episode psychosis (FEP). The second aim was to determine whether the pattern of inpatient admission during this period was associated with remission of psychotic symptoms or inpatient service use at 15-month follow-up.\n\nOne hundred and four consecutive patients with FEP at a specialist treatment service were approached to participate in a follow-up study. Patients were grouped on the basis of the pattern of inpatient admission (none, one, or multiple) during the first 3 months of treatment. Clinical ratings at baseline and 3-month follow-up, and ratings of remission of psychotic symptoms at 3 and 15-month follow-up, were available for two-thirds of the patients. Inpatient data for the 15-month follow-up period were derived from an electronic database for most patients (n = 98).\n\nEighty (76.9%) of the 104 patients were admitted to an inpatient unit during the first 3 months of treatment. Fifty-nine (56.7%) patients had a single admission and 21 (20.2%) had multiple admissions. At baseline, inpatient admission was associated with a diagnosis of affective psychosis and more severe behavioural and functional disturbance but not positive psychotic symptoms. Multiple admissions were associated with risks to self or others at baseline and 3-month follow-up, and lack of remission of positive symptoms at 3 and 15-month follow-up. There was no association between the pattern of inpatient admission during the initial 3-month period and inpatient service use during the following 12-month period.",
        "Comparison between BRCA1-associated and sporadic ovarian carcinomas is a potential method to identify candidate modifier gene/s involved in the carcinogenic pathway of either or both groups. A previous study identified a significant difference in the frequency of copy number gain at 2q24-q32 by comparing BRCA1-associated and sporadic ovarian tumour specimens using comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH). The present study aimed to investigate the reported allelic imbalance at 2q24-32 by amplification of several microsatellite markers at the region by quantitative microsatellite analysis (QuMA) using Taqman at the same region identified as a site of allelic imbalance.\n\nThe copy number of the genomic region in 2q24-32 was established in 21 BRCA1-associated ovarian carcinomas and 14 sporadic cases using quantitative microsatellite polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Statistical analysis was performed using permutation test analysis.\n\nA significant loss at D2S156 marker (2q24.2) (p = 0.026) compared with the other three markers at 2q24-32 was found in the sporadic cohort but not in the BRCA1-associated group (p = 0.385).",
        "Muscles of the trunk, hip, and knee influence the orientation of the lower extremity during weight bearing activities. The purpose of this study was threefold: first, to compare the orientation of the lower extremity during a single leg (SL) squat among male and female athletes; second, to compare the strength of muscle groups in the trunk, hips, and knees between these individuals; and third, to evaluate the association between trunk, hip, and knee strength and the orientation of the knee joint during this activity.\n\nTwenty-four male and 22 female athletes participated in this study. Peak isometric torque was determined for the following muscle actions: trunk flexion, extension, and lateral flexion, hip abduction and external rotation, and knee flexion and extension. The frontal plane projection angle (FPPA) of the knee during a 45 degrees SL squat was determined using photo editing software.\n\nMales and females moved in opposite directions during the SL squat test (F(1,42) = 5.05, P = 0.03). Females typically moved toward more extreme FPPA during SL squats (P = 0.056), while males tended to move toward more neutral alignment (P = 0.066). Females also generated less torque in all muscle groups, with the exception of trunk extension. The projection angle of the knee during the SL squat test was most closely associated with hip external rotation strength.",
        "The majority of patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection suffer from disabling fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and quality of life reduction. Meanwhile, there is increasing evidence that HCV infection can affect brain function. Recent studies have shown that fatigue and psychomotor slowing may resolve in patients with hepatitis C after treatment with ondansetron. This observation indicates alteration of serotonergic neurotransmission in HCV infected patients with chronic fatigue.\n\nData from 20 HCV infected patients who were referred to our clinic because of disabling fatigue and cognitive decline of unknown cause were analysed retrospectively. Patients had undergone a diagnostic programme, including clinical and psychometric examination, electroencephalogram (EEG), magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and I-123-beta-CIT (2beta-carbomethoxy-3-beta-(4-[(123)I]iodophenyl)tropane) single photon emission computerised tomography (SPECT) studies of serotonin and dopamine transporter binding capacity.\n\nAll patients had pathological results on the fatigue impact scale. Two thirds of patients showed pathological attention test results. EEG, magnetic resonance imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis were normal. Pathological dopamine transporter binding was present in 12/20 (60%) patients and pathological serotonin transporter binding in 8/19 (50%) patients. Patients with normal SPECT results did not significantly differ from controls with regard to psychometric test results. Interestingly, patients with both decreased serotonin and dopamine transporter binding showed significantly impaired performance in most of the tests applied. Comorbidity that could have impaired cerebral function was excluded in all patients.",
        "To examine the pleural fluid (PF) and serum levels of angiopoietin (Ang)-1, Ang-2, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in patients with pleural effusions (PEs).\n\nOne hundred fifteen patients, 16 with transudative PEs due to heart failure and 99 with exudative PEs (malignant, 40; para-pneumonic, 24; tuberculous, 13; miscellaneous etiologies, 22) were included in the study. PF and serum levels of the growth factors were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\n\nPF Ang-2 and VEGF levels but not Ang-1 levels were higher (p < 0.001) in exudates than in transudates. PF Ang-2 levels were higher in tuberculous PEs than in PEs of any other etiology and were lower in heart failure PEs than in PEs of any other etiology. The highest PF VEGF levels were observed in patients with malignant and parapneumonic PEs. The lowest PF VEGF levels were observed in patients with transudates. In PEs, Ang-2 levels correlate with VEGF levels (p < 0.001), RBC count (p = 0.002), nucleated cell count (p < 0.001), total protein levels (p < 0.001), and lactate dehydrogenase levels (p < 0.001). PF Ang-1 levels were lower than serum Ang-1 levels both in patients with exudates (p < 0.001) and in those with transudates (p = 0.001). PF Ang-2 levels were higher than serum Ang-2 levels both in patients with exudates (p < 0.001) and in those with transudates (p = 0.045). PF VEGF levels were higher than serum VEGF levels in patients with malignant PEs (p < 0.001) and parapneumonic PEs (p = 0.003), but lower than serum VEGF levels in heart failure PEs (p < 0.001). In patients with tuberculous PEs and exudative PEs of miscellaneous etiology, PF and serum VEGF levels did not differ significantly.",
        "To examine the significance of the thymus and the neutralization of interleukin-2 (IL-2) in treating renal cancer, as the involvement of immunoregulatory cells in tumour development in vivo is well known, naturally occurring CD25+ CD4+ T cells possess potent immunoregulatory functions, and they are of thymic origin dependent on IL-2.\n\nWe first tested activity against mouse renal cell carcinoma (RENCA) cells by adoptively transferring splenocytes of euthymic Balb/c mice depleted of CD25+ cells into athymic Balb/c nude mice bearing established macroscopic RENCA tumours. Second, we tested the anti-RENCA activity in euthymic mice bearing macroscopic RENCA tumours by neutralizing IL-2.\n\nThe intravenous administration of CD25+ cell-depleted splenocytes of euthymic Balb/c mice initiated the retardation of macroscopic RENCA tumours subcutaneously established in athymic Balb/c mice. The tumour site showed massive lymphocyte infiltration of mainly CD4+ T cells. By eliminating either the CD4+ cells, CD8+ cells, or natural killer (NK) cells with antibodies after the adoptive transfer of CD25+ cell-depleted splenocytes of euthymic Balb/c mice, macroscopic RENCA tumour retardation was abrogated. The growth of macroscopic RENCA tumour established in euthymic Balb/c mice was also retarded with IL-2 neutralization alone by anti-IL-2 monoclonal antibody (mAb), as well as co-administration of anti-IL-2 mAb and anti-CD25 mAb compared with that of the controls given vehicle. After tumour inoculation, peri- and intratumoral infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was very prominent in RENCA tumours in hosts given anti-IL-2 mAb, regardless of the administration of anti-CD25 mAb. Two x 10(5) units of recombinant human IL-2 reverted the retardation of RENCA tumour growth caused by the anti-IL-2 mAb. IL-2 neutralization alone in euthymic Balb/c mice with no tumour inoculation did not suppress splenic CD25+ CD4+ T cells.",
        "It is known that posterior malleolar fracture is often associated with tibial diaphyseal fractures. However, in literature there are very few studies on tibial shaft fractures with respect to posterior malleolus fragment. We hypothesized that the incidence of posterior malleolar fracture is higher than in previous studies.\n\nA total of 74 closed tibial shaft fractures were treated with intramedullary nailing in Turku University Central Hospital between January 1994 and December 1998. There were 55 men and 19 women, with a mean age of 39 years (range, 16 to 58 years). Two cases were excluded and 72 tibial shaft fractures were analyzed retrospectively.\n\nPosterior malleolar fracture was observed in 18 cases (25.0%). Only 10 were observed preoperatively in plain films, seven were detected postoperatively and one was not detected at all during the treatment. Retrospectively, all 18 posterior malleolar fractures were detectable in preoperative plain films.",
        "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of medication with anticoagulant properties on the false positive rate in a population-based faecal occult blood test (FOBt) colorectal screening programme.\n\nEight hundred and forty-six consecutive individuals found to be FOBt-positive in the Scottish arm of the national colorectal cancer screening pilot were studied. All were aged between 50 and 69 years and underwent colonoscopy. Before the procedure the participants\" current medication was recorded, and correlated with the colonoscopic findings.\n\nOf 846 participants, 301 (35.6%) were taking regular anticoagulant medication at the time of FOB testing. Of these, 143 (47.5%) had colorectal neoplasia found on colonoscopy, whereas of those not taking anticoagulant medication, 308 (56.5%) were found to have neoplasia. This 9% difference was statistically significant (P = 0.012).",
        "Elevated troponin levels are an independent indicator of poor outcome in ischemic stroke. The authors performed a retrospective study to ascertain whether elevated cardiac troponin I (cTnI) influences outcome from intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).\n\nPatients were included if they had a cTnI level measured and a head CT performed within 24 hours of presentation with a spontaneous ICH. Those with recent stroke, angina, or myocardial ischemia were excluded. CT scans were reviewed to determine the hematoma size, location, presence of intraventricular or subarachnoid hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, and midline shift.\n\nOf the 729 ICH patients admitted over 4 years, 235 were included in the analysis. Most exclusions were for medical reasons or because of lack of a CT. Mortality was higher in the 18% with a peak cTnI level > 0.4 ng/mL (58 vs 34%, p = 0.009) and having elevated cTnI was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (Exp [beta] 3.68, 95% CI 1.2 to 11.2, p = 0.023). Three patients (1.2%) died due to cardiac events, all of whom had an elevated cTnI level on admission.",
        "To examine the contribution of neuropsychological test performance to treatment decision-making capacity in community volunteers with mild to moderate dementia.\n\nThe authors recruited volunteers (44 men, 44 women) with mild to moderate dementia from the community. Subjects completed a battery of 11 neuropsychological tests that assessed auditory and visual attention, logical memory, language, and executive function. To measure decision making capacity, the authors administered the Capacity to Consent to Treatment Interview, the Hopemont Capacity Assessment Interview, and the MacCarthur Competence Assessment Tool--Treatment. Each of these instruments individually scores four decisional abilities serving capacity: understanding, appreciation, reasoning, and expression of choice. The authors used principal components analysis to generate component scores for each ability across instruments, and to extract principal components for neuropsychological performance.\n\nMultiple linear regression analyses demonstrated that neuropsychological performance significantly predicted all four abilities. Specifically, it predicted 77.8% of the common variance for understanding, 39.4% for reasoning, 24.6% for appreciation, and 10.2% for expression of choice. Except for reasoning and appreciation, neuropsychological predictor (beta) profiles were unique for each ability.",
        "Alpha1-blockers improve voiding symptoms through the reduction of prostatic and urethral smooth muscle tone; however, the underlying mechanism of improvement of storage symptoms is not known. Using a rat model of detrusor overactivity caused by cerebral infarction (CI), we undertook the present study to determine whether the effect of an alpha1-blocker, naftopidil, is dependent on the suppression of C-fiber afferents.\n\nTo induce desensitization of C-fiber bladder afferents, we injected resiniferatoxin (0.3 mg/kg, RTX) sub-cutaneously to female Sprague-Dawley rats 2 days prior to left middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) (RTX-CI rats). As controls we used rats without RTX treatment (CI rats). MCAO and insertion of a polyethylene catheter through the bladder dome were performed under halothane anesthesia. We investigated the effects on cystometrography (CMG) of intravenous (i.v.), intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.), or intrathecal (i.t.) administration of naftopidil in conscious CI rats.\n\nBladder capacity (BC) was markedly reduced after MCAO in both RTX-CI and CI rats. I.v. administration of naftopidil significantly increased BC in CI rats without an increase in residual volume, but it had no effects on BC in RTX-CI rats. I.t. administration of naftopidil significantly increased BC in CI but not in RTX-CI rats.",
        "To investigate the main cause of drug-resistant tuberculosis.\n\nClinic isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from 1996 to 2004 in Shanghai were analyzed and the proportion of isolates from new cases (the proxy of primary drug-resistance) and retreatment cases (the proxy of acquired drug-resistance) were calculated. Mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units (MIRU) genotyping was performed and analyzed on pairs of isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from 16 recurrent patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis.\n\nOf all 8 120 isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from new cases, 707 isolates (8.7%) were drug resistant. Of all 610 isolates from retreatment cases, 150 isolates (24.6%) were drug resistant. Primary drug resistance accounted for 82.5% (707/857) of all drug resistant isolates. Based on the MIRU genotypes, 13 of all 16 recurrent drug-resistant patients were reinfected with new drug-resistant strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.",
        "We previously showed that Toll-like receptor-9 (TLR-9) ligands ameliorate experimental colitis. In this study, we evaluated the effect of TLR-9 ligands on the generation of proinflammatory cytokines by human colonic mucosa.\n\nColonoscopic biopsies were obtained from patients with active ulcerative colitis (UC) and from normal subjects. The tissue was organ cultured for 24 hours in the presence or absence of different types of immunostimulatory (ISS) (CpG)-oligonucleotides (ODNs). Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) levels in the medium were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\n\nIn active UC, hTNF-alpha and hIL-lbeta generation by inflamed colonic mucosa is 7- and 3-fold higher, respectively, than their generation by normal mucosa. Class B CpG ODNs inhibited colonic TNF-alpha and IL-1beta generation by 50%, whereas class A or C ODNs had a partial or no effect, respectively. A novel class of ODNs that is based on multiple TCG repeats was as effective as class B ODNs. This inhibition resulted from the transcriptional suppression of IL-1beta that occurred within the first 2 hours after ISS-ODN incubation. The addition of chloroquine abolished the inhibitory effects of ISS-ODNs on colonic TNF-alpha and IL-1beta generation.",
        "An improved assessment of risk of spinal injury during lifting activities depends on an accurate estimation of trunk muscle forces, spinal loads and stability margin which in turn requires, amongst others, an accurate description of trunk muscle geometries. The lines of action of erector spinae muscles are often assumed to be linear despite the curved paths of these muscles in forward flexion postures.\n\nA novel approach was introduced that allowed for the proper simulation of curved paths for global extensor muscles in our Kinematics-driven finite element model. The lever arms of global muscles at different levels were restrained either to remain the same or decrease only by 10% relative to their respective values in upright posture. Based on our earlier measurements, static lifting tasks at two trunk flexions (40 degrees and 65 degrees ) and three lumbar postures (free style, lordotic and kyphotic) with 180 N in hands were analyzed.\n\nMuscle forces and spinal compression at all levels substantially decreased as the global extensor muscles took curved paths. In contrast, the shear force at lower levels increased. Allowing for a 10% reduction in these lever arms during flexion increased muscle forces and compression forces at all levels. Despite smaller muscle forces, wrapping of global muscles slightly improved the spinal stability.",
        "Malignant tumors show an inherent genetic instability that can be classified as microsatellite instability (MSI) or chromosomal instability (CIN). To elucidate the differences in biological characteristics of bladder cancer between the two types of genetic instability, the expression of the mismatch repair (MMR) proteins, Aurora-A and p53 proteins, the number of centrosomes, numerical aberrations of chromosomes and 20q13, and DNA ploidy were examined in 100 human urothelial carcinomas of the bladder.\n\nExpressions of the MLH1, MSH2, Aurora-A, and p53 proteins and the numbers of centrosomes were immunohistochemically assessed. Numerical aberrations of chromosomes 7, 9, 17, and 20q13 spots were evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization, and DNA ploidy was assessed by laser scanning cytometry.\n\nThe expression levels of the MMR related-proteins decreased in 9 of 100 tumors. Tumors with low MLH1 or MSH2 expression (designated as MSI cancers) were not linked with centrosome amplification, Aurora-A overexpression, increased p53 immunoreactivity, 20q13 gain, DNA aneuploidy, and disease progression. MSI cancers showed a favorable prognosis. CIN cancers (49 cases), defined as tumors with a large intercellular variation in centromere copy numbers, were associated more frequently with centrosome amplification, Aurora-A overexpression, increased p53 immunoreactivity, and 20q13 gain than the others (51 cases). Tumors with disease progression were included in the CIN cancer group.",
        "Proton pump inhibitors are the most potent drug treatment for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Pre-meal dosing maximizes efficacy while sub-optimal dose timing may limit efficacy.\n\nTo determine the prevalence of sub-optimal proton pump inhibitor dosing in a community-based gastro-oesophageal reflux disease population.\n\nOne hundred patients on proton pump inhibitors referred for persistent gastro-oesophageal reflux disease symptoms were questioned about their proton pump inhibitor dosing habits and classified as optimal or sub-optimal dosers. Optimal dosers took proton pump inhibitors with or up to 60 min before meals. Sub-optimal dosers took proton pump inhibitors >60 min before meals, after meals, as needed, or at bedtime.\n\nForty-six percent dosed optimally. Fifty-four percent dosed sub-optimally with 21 of 54 (39%) dosing >60 min before meals, 16 (30%) after meals, 15 (28%) at bedtime and two (4%) as needed. Only 6% of the subjects on once-daily proton pump inhibitor regimens and 33% of subjects taking proton pump inhibitors two- to three times daily dosed in a manner that maximized acid suppression (15-30 min before a meal).",
        "Although an intraventricular filling delay has been observed in patients with a psuedonormalized transmitral flow pattern, little is known about the underlying hydrodynamic nature of this phenomenon.\n\nTo examine those hydrodynamics, we studied every echocardiographic frame showing ventricular inflow (80 Hz) in the apical long-axis view and M-mode image using contrast echocardiography in 29 patients with a psuedonormalized pattern and in 26 normal controls. The velocity of the filling flow front (Vp), the ratio of Vp to E, and the mean radius of the vortices associated with the filling flow were measured.\n\nIn both groups, vortices were observed at the ridge of the mitral valve during acceleration of the E-wave. The mean radius of the vortices was greater in the pseudonormalized filling group than that in the control group (8 +/- 2 vs 3 +/- 1 mm, P < 0.0001). Vp was smaller in the pseudonormalized group than in the control group (36 +/- 6 vs 47 +/- 6 cm/sec, P = 0.0008). Vp/E was < 1 and smaller in the pseudonormalized group than that in the control group (0.46 +/- 0.13 vs 0.59 +/- 0.07, P = 0.014) and negatively correlated with the mean radius of the vortices (r = 0.54, P < 0.0001).",

        "Previous studies have shown that edema formation after diffuse traumatic brain injury (TBI) with secondary insult is cytotoxic and not vasogenic. This assumption is based on observations of reduced apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and lack of significant accumulation of intravascular tracer in brain tissue. However, ADC reduction does not exclude vasogenic edema, and intravascular tracer can only accumulate when it reaches the tissue and is not perfusion limited. This study aims to confirm tissue delivery of intravascular tracer and lack of BBB opening during a phase of rapid brain swelling after diffuse TBI.\n\nRats were exposed to either TBI using the impact acceleration model combined with 30 minutes of hypoxia and hypotension, or sham injury. At 2 or 4 hours after injury, ADC and tissue water content were assessed using MRI. Gd-DTPA was given followed by a combination of rapid T2 imaging (60 seconds) and T1 imaging (30 minutes). Signal intensity changes were analyzed to determine a bolus effect (dynamic susceptibility contrast) and longer-term tissue accumulation of Gd-DTPA.\n\nMean increase in cortical water content on the left was 0.8% at 2 hours, 2.1% at 4 hours; on the right it was 0.5% at 2 hours and 1.7% at 4 hours (p < 0.05). Mean ADC reduction over 4 hours was 0.04 x 10(-3) mm2/s on the left and 0.06 x 10(-3) mm2/s on the right. Kinetic analysis of signal intensity changes after Gd-DTPA showed no significant difference in inward transfer coefficient (BBB permeability) between sham injury and 2 or 4 hours post-injury. T2 imaging showed consistent tissue delivery of a bolus of Gd-DTPA to the tissue at 2 and 4 hours post-injury, comparable to sham animals.",

The clinical features of patients were summary.\n\nA heterozygous point mutation 2015G-->A causing R672H in the SCN4A was found in five patients and five normal relatives of the two families. Features of R672H mutation are incomplete penetrance, especially non-penetrance of phenotype in women and potassium is effective, but acetazolamide is not.",
        "To study the effects of aldose reductase (AR) on production of fibronectin and type IV collagen in rat mesangial cells (MsC).\n\nThe vector, pcDNA3-AR, was constructed based on pET-15b-AR. Lipofect AMINE was used for stable transfection and G418 was used for selecting positive clones. Sorbinil and zopolrestat were added for suppressing the activity of AR, respectively. The production of fibronectin and type IV collagen and the activation of Smads and MAPK signal transduction pathway were analysed by western blot and AP-1 activity was analysed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA).\n\nThe normal MsC showed increased expression of fibronectin and type IV collagen with stimulation of TGF-beta1. Compared with the normal MsC, the MsC pre-incubated with ARI showed reduced expression (P < 0.05) and the AR-transfected MsC showed increased expression (P < 0.05). The normal MsC showed activation of ERK, JNK and p38 with stimulation of TGF-beta1, while the activation of JNK and p38 was inhibited in the MsC pre-incubated with ARI and only the activation of JNK was enhanced in the AR-transfected MsC. The normal MsC showed enhanced AP-1 activity with the stimulation of TGF-beta1, and similarly the activity was inhibited in the MsC pre-incubated with ARI and was more enhanced in the AR transfected MsC.",
        "Hyperhomocysteinaemia is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease with a remarkable prevalence in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF). Low doses of folic acid (FA) with or without vitamin B6 and B12 has been shown to effectively reduce plasma homocysteine (Hcy). The aim of this study was to compare the short-term effects of two different oral doses of FA (5 vs 15 mg/d) on plasma Hcy levels in subjects suffering from moderate-severe CRF.\n\nA double-blind, double-dummy, comparative, two-stage randomised study was performed. Seventeen patients aged 45-71 years, with glomerular filtration rates between 15.4-50 mL/min 1.73/m2 were randomly assigned to receive FA 5 mg/d (FA-5, n: 8) or FA 15 mg/d (FA-15, n: 9) for 30 days. At the end of this 30-day double-blind period, all the participants were placed on FA 5 mg/d (open period), for 5 additional months. Both groups were also supplemented with vitamins B1, B6 and B12 throughout the trial. Blood samples were drawn at 0, 15, 30, 90 and 180 days to assess Hcy, complete blood count (CBC) and sequential multichannel analysis (SMA). Chest X-ray and a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) were also performed.\n\nPlasma Hcy (mean +/- SEM) decreased from 27.9 +/- 1.4 (baseline) to 15.1 +/- 0.6, 13.3 +/- 0.9, 14.1 +/- 0.5 and 13.8 +/- 0.5 micromol/L (FA-5) and from 28.8 +/- 2.7 to 15.6 +/- 1.2, 14.4 +/- 1.3, 13.0 +/- 0.7 and 13.1 +/- 0.6 micromol/L (FA-15) at days 15, 30, 90 and 180, respectively. (P < 0.01 from day 15 to 180 vs baseline for both groups with no differences between them). Renal function remained stable throughout the entire period of the study in all but one patient in whom it deteriorated to pre-end stage disease. No adverse cardiovascular events developed during the trial.",
        "Polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN)-dominated inflammation is prominent in the airways of subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF) and chronic bronchitis (CB). Interleukin (IL)-8, myeloperoxidase (MPO), and DNA are markers of neutrophilic inflammation. We hypothesized that sputum MPO, DNA, and IL-8 concentrations would negatively correlate with pulmonary function and sputum transportability.\n\nWe measured pulmonary function and analyzed sputum IL-8, MPO, and DNA concentrations, as well as the transport properties of sputum samples obtained from 16 subjects with CF and 15 subjects with CB. We also evaluated changes in these measurements in paired sputum samples from these subjects obtained 2 to 12 months apart.\n\nIL-8 and MPO concentrations in the sputum of CF subjects was inversely correlated with FEV(1) percent predicted (IL-8: r = -0.40; p = 0.003; MPO: r = -0.38; p = 0.003) and FVC percent predicted (IL-8: r = -0.4; p = 0.02; MPO: r = -0.4; p = 0.02). IL-8 and DNA concentrations were inversely correlated with sputum cough transportability (CTR) [IL-8: r = -0.4; p = 0.02; DNA: r = -0.36; p = 0.048]. Changes in DNA concentration in sputum samples from CF subjects over time were inversely correlated with changes in FEV(1) percent predicted (r = -0.58; p = 0.02), FVC percent predicted (r = -0.74; p = 0.002), and CTR (r = -0.59; p = 0.02). There was no correlation among pulmonary function, sputum properties, and inflammatory markers in the sputum from subjects with CB.",
        "Several evidences implicate that monoamines play a modulatory role in the brain mechanisms underlying encoding and retrieval of emotional memories. Recent experiments demonstrate that acute monoaminergic potentiation with the antidepressants bupropion or sertraline enhance the retrieval of longterm emotional memory in rodents. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that acute monoaminergic re-uptake inhibition with these antidepressants might enhance retrieval of emotional memory in man.\n\nThe central monoaminergic system was stimulated with either bupropion or sertraline in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design with 105 healthy adult subjects divided in three groups (placebo, 150 mg-bupropion and 50 mg-sertraline). Memory was evaluated with a \"surprise\" memory test 7 days after the presentation of an emotional story and with a word-cued autobiographical memory test.\n\nA total of 99 volunteers completed the experimental procedures. Contrasting to our prediction, we found no memory enhancing effect for either drug in both memory tests. All groups showed the expected heightened memory performance to the middle \"emotive\" phase of the story.",
        "Recent studies have suggested that benign papillary lesions without atypia [benign papilloma (BP)] diagnosed on breast core needle biopsy (CNB) may not require excision. However, most have studied only small numbers of cases and scant data are available on the utility of immunohistochemistry in the categorization of papillary lesions on CNB. In the largest published series of BP identified on CNB, we studied the impact of immunohistochemistry on the accuracy of a CNB diagnosis of BP.\n\nBreast CNBs (n = 129) with a diagnosis of papillary lesion were immunostained for calponin, p63 and cytokeratin 5/6. Haematoxylin and eosin and immunostained slides were independently reviewed by four breast pathologists. BP was the final excision diagnosis in 35 cases. With the use of immunohistochemistry, the positive predictive value (PPV) of BP diagnosis by the four individual pathologists increased from 72.7-83.3% (mean 79.2%) to 77.8-87.5% (82.1%), the negative predictive value (NPV) increased from 77.8-98.5% (88.6%) to 100% for all four participants and overall accuracy increased from 78.7-92.6% (84.7%) to 90.7-95.4% (92.8%). No case of invasive carcinoma was diagnosed as BP on CNB by any participant. The frequency of ductal carcinoma in situ following a BP diagnosis on CNB ranged from 2.5% to 4.8% (4%) but was only 0-3% (2.3%) after excluding cases that were radiologically suspicious for malignancy.",

We extracted the DNA by glass fiber matrix mini column. We amplified the ICAM gene by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and tested the PCR products for the presence of the polymorphisms using a restriction enzyme specific for each polymorphism. We analyzed the results by agarose electrophoresis.\n\nWe demonstrated the association of only one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (K469) with Beh\u00e7ets disease, while we could not detect the other SNP (G241A) in either controls or patients in the Lebanese population.",
        "To investigate the impact of new myocardial infarction definition based on troponin, the rate of myocardial infarction diagnosis, patients characteristics, and short-term prognosis.\n\nWe enrolled 1,255 consecutive myocardial infarction patients from the Kuwait Registry of Acute Coronary Syndromes from December 2003 to May 2004. Two patient groups were identified, those diagnosed with elevated creatine kinase-MB (CK group) and those diagnosed with elevated troponin with normal CK-MB (Troponin group).\n\nThe use of troponin have increased the number of myocardial infarctions by 49%. Compared with the CK group, the Troponin group were older [age 60.3 +/- 12.5 years versus 53.7 +/- 12.2 years, p<0.001], more likely to have diabetes (59% versus 41%, p<0.001), hypertension (59% versus 36%, p<0.001), and hypercholesterolemia (37% versus 24%, p<0.001). The Troponin group were more likely to suffer heart failure at presentation than the CK group (32% versus 14%, p<0.001) and, subsequently, increase incidence of heart failure during their hospital stay (17% versus 8%, p<0.001).",
        "To examine the associations between postmortem Alzheimer disease (AD) neuropathology and autopsy-verified cardiovascular disease.\n\nThe authors examined 99 subjects (mean age at death = 87.6; SD = 8.7) from the Mount Sinai School of Medicine Department of Psychiatry Brain Bank who were devoid of cerebrovascular disease-associated lesions or of non-AD-related neuropathology. Density of neuritic plaques (NPs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) as well as coronary artery and aortic atherosclerosis, left ventricular wall thickness, and heart weight were measured. Partial correlations were used to assess the associations of the four cardiovascular variables with NPs and NFTs in the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and multiple regions of the cerebral cortex after controlling for age at death, sex, dementia severity, body mass index, and ApoE genotype. These analyses were also repeated separately for ApoE4 carriers and noncarriers.\n\nThe extent of coronary artery disease and to a lesser extent atherosclerosis were significantly associated with the density of cardinal neuropathologic lesions of AD in this autopsy sample (significant correlations between 0.22 and 0.29). These associations were more pronounced for the ApoE4 allele carriers (n = 42; significant correlations between 0.34 and 0.47).",
        "For young subjects, it is well-documented that training and practice improve sensorimotor performance. However, little is known about how the typically observed age-related decline of sensorimotor abilities can be ameliorated by sensory stimulation.\n\nAs an alternative approach to training, we have introduced a tactile coactivation protocol involving Hebbian synaptic plasticity to improve tactile performance on a short timescale of a few hours.\n\nBy applying coactivation on the index finger to drive perceptual learning, we demonstrate that in the elderly, aged 65 to 89 years, the age-related impairment of tactile two-point discrimination can be mitigated substantially. In elderly adults, tactile-acuity thresholds increased to 3.5mm compared with 1.5mm found in young adults, whereas 50-year-old subjects showed intermediate performance. As a result of coactivation, discrimination thresholds of the 80-year-old adults came to match those typically found at an age of 50, demonstrating that age-related decline in tactile performance is not irreversible, but rather subject to considerable restoration by specific stimulation protocols.",
        "Exosomes are small membrane vesicles secreted by several cell types during exocytic fusion of multivesicular bodies with the plasma membrane. Exosomes from tumour cells can transfer antigens from cell to cell, a property favouring antigen-specific immune responses in vitro and in vivo, and are thus an interesting putative therapeutic tool in human cancers. Exosomes have been well studied in EBV (Epstein-Barr virus)-transformed human B-cell lines; however, biological stimuli regulating exosome secretion quantitatively and/or qualitatively still remain poorly defined.\n\nWe analysed the effect of the BCR stimulation on exosome release in the human follicular lymphoma B-cell line DOHH2. We found that BCR (B-cell receptor) triggering of DOHH2 cells induced the polarization of CD63(+) MHC class II compartments. Moreover, BCR stimulation increased the release of exosome-associated proteins in the extracellular space. Finally, we found that the BCR was expressed at the surface of exosomes, and could target a bound anti-human IgG to these vesicles.",

Three independent reviewers adjudicated the presence of abnormalities and resulting treatment changes.\n\nOf the 117 brain CT scans, 32 (27%) were ordered to exclude intracranial hemorrhage, 30 (26%) to exclude cerebrovascular accident (CVA), 16 (14%) for falls, 15 (13%) for syncope, seven (6%) to exclude subdural hemorrhage, five (4%) for mental status change, and 12 (10%) for other reasons. Of the 117 brain CT scans, 29 (25%) had abnormalities, including acute CVA or hemorrhage, old CVA, meningioma, and other abnormalities. Only 10 (9% of all scans, 34% of abnormal scans) resulted in treatment changes (including consultations, further imaging, stroke evaluation, and drug changes). The presence of focal neurological deficits was significantly associated with treatment changes after CT scans (odds ratio=13.2, 95% confidence interval=1.7-161.5).",
        "To evaluate the power of several self-reported depressive symptoms to predict nursing home admission (NHA).\n\nA Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the risk of NHA.\n\nData were from the Health Outcomes Survey (a national random sample of 137,000 Medicare + Choice enrollees aged 65 and older), the Nursing Home Minimum Data Set, and the Medicare Enrollment Database.\n\nMedicare beneficiaries aged 65 and older enrolled in a Medicare Managed Care Plan who were self-respondents to the questionnaire and were not institutionalized at the time of the survey.\n\nVariables were self-reported functional status, chronic health conditions, demographics, and several mood-related questions.\n\nAfter controlling for age, race, sex, marital status, home ownership, functional status, and comorbid conditions, individuals who identified themselves as feeling sad or depressed much of the time over the previous year were at significantly higher risk of NHA.",
        "This study was aimed at determining if significant uterine tachysystole was associated with adverse fetal or neonatal outcomes during cervical ripening and induction of labor.\n\nWomen undergoing cervical ripening and subsequent labor induction (n = 905) were assessed for tachysystole, defined as \u22656 contractions in each of 2 consecutive 10-minute windows. Women with \u22653 episodes of tachysystole were compared to women with no tachysystole.\n\nOver a 5-year period, 70% of the 905 participants (n = 631) had no tachysystole, 143 had 1 or 2 episodes whereas 131 or 15% had \u22653 episodes (p = 0.991). The cesarean delivery rate was lower among those with tachysystole (28.2 vs. 34.1%), but the difference was not significant (p = 0.197). Non-reassuring fetal tracings were more common in the tachysystole group (14.4 vs. 21.4%, p = 0.017), but the Apgar scores at 5 min and the umbilical cord pH and base excess were similar between the 2 groups (p = 0.502, p = 0.435, and p = 0.535, respectively).",
        "Tigecycline, one of the few therapeutic options against multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, reaches subinhibitory serum concentrations only with cautious clinical dosing and pharmacokinetics. Subinhibitory concentrations of tigecycline might induce an A. baumannii biofilm.\n\nBiofilm formation was assessed via the crystal violet staining method. We further analyzed the main biofilm components with NaIO4, proteinase K, and DNase. Real-time RT-PCR was applied for quantitative detection of biofilm potential-associated genes.\n\nIn this study, A. baumannii proved to be a strong biofilm producer, and we found that proteins and extracellular DNA are crucial components of the A. baumannii biofilm. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR revealed positive correlations between biofilm formation restrained by subinhibitory concentrations of tigecycline and the expression of biofilm potential-associated genes, especially the AdeFGH efflux pump gene.",
        "Hyaluronic acid-binding protein 1 (HABP1/gC1qR/p32) has been recently implicated in oncogenesis and cancer progression in various malignancies; however, its clinical role in gastric cancer (GC) is still unclear.\n\nFirst, HABP1 expression was determined by Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. Then, we evaluated the expression of HABP1 and its clinical significance in tumor tissues from 181 patients with GC.\n\nExpression of HABP1 protein in GC tissues was noticeably higher than that in adjacent nonneoplastic tissues (",
        "Intracranial arterial calcification (ICAC) is frequently detected on head computed tomography and has been found to be associated with ischemic stroke by recent clinical studies.\n\nBased on a hospital-based study, we aimed to compare the occurrence of cerebral microembolic signals (MES) among stroke patients with different degrees of ICAC, which may indicate the potential mechanisms linking ICAC and ischemic stroke in intracranial atherosclerosis patients.\n\nThis is a post-hoc analysis of our previous clinical study in 2005-2007, recruiting consecutive ischemic stroke patients with middle cerebral artery territory infarctions and good temporal window for MES monitoring. The degrees of ICAC in the Circle of Willis, especially calcification in the ipsilateral intracranial internal carotid artery (iICA), were evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively on unenhanced head computed tomography.\n\nAmong the 68 recruited patients, MES was detected in 26 patients (38.24%). The overall degree of ICAC in the Circle of Willis was similar between patients with and without MES. For calcification in ipsilateral iICA, the presence of MES was more frequent in the high extent group (widest arc of calcification \u226590\u00b0) than in the low extent group (54.2% versus 29.5%, P\\u2009=\\u2009.046). Logistic regression found that a high extent ipsilateral iICA calcification was an independent risk factor of MES (odds ratio: 3.134; 95% confidence interval, 1.029-9.543; P\\u2009=\\u2009.044).",
        "Low muscle mass (LMM) and low muscle attenuation (LMA) reflect low muscle quantity and low muscle quality, respectively. Both are associated with a poor outcome in several types of solid malignancies. This study determined the association of skeletal muscle measures with overall survival (OS) and time to next treatment (TNT).\n\nA skeletal muscle index (SMI) in cm\n\nThe prevalence of LMM, sarcopenic obesity and LMA were 66.9%, 7.2% and 59.6% respectively. LMM and sarcopenic obesity showed no significant association with OS and TNT, whereas LMA was associated with both lower OS (HR 2.04, 95% CI 1.34-3.12, p\\xa0=\\xa00.001) and shorter TNT (HR 1.72, 95% CI 1.14-2.62, p\\xa0=\\xa00.010). Patients with LMA had a median OS and TNT of 15 and 8 months respectively, compared to 23 and 10 months in patients with normal MA.",
        "The obesogenic and diabetogenic effects of the environmental toxin bisphenol A during critical windows of development are well recognized. Liver and skeletal muscle play a central role in the control of glucose production, utilization, and storage.\n\nWe hypothesized that maternal bisphenol A exposure disrupts insulin signaling in rat offspring liver and skeletal muscle. We determined the protein expression of hepatic and skeletal muscle insulin signaling molecules including insulin receptor beta, its downstream target insulin receptor substrate 1 and glucose transporters (glucose transporter 2, glucose transporter 4), and hepatic glucose-regulating enzymes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucokinase.\n\nRat dams had ad libitum access to filtered drinking water (control) or drinking water with bisphenol A from 2 weeks prior to mating and through pregnancy and lactation. Offspring litters were standardized to 4 males and 4 females and nursed by the same dam. At weaning, bisphenol A exposure was removed from all offspring. Glucose tolerance was tested at 6 weeks and 6 months. Liver and skeletal muscle was collected from 3 week old and 10 month old offspring for protein expression (Western blot) of insulin receptor beta, insulin receptor substrate 1, glucose transporter 2, glucose transporter 4, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and glucokinase.\n\nMale, but not female, bisphenol A offspring had impaired glucose tolerance at 6 weeks and 6 months. Both male and female adult offspring had higher glucose-stimulated insulin secretion as well as the ratio of stimulated insulin to glucose. Male bisphenol A offspring had higher liver protein abundance of the 200 kDa insulin receptor beta precursor (2-fold), and insulin receptor substrate 1 (1.5-fold), whereas glucose transporter 2 was 0.5-fold of the control at 3 weeks of age. In adult male bisphenol A offspring, the abundance of insulin receptor beta was higher (2-fold) and glucose transporter 4 was 0.8-fold of the control in skeletal muscle. In adult female bisphenol A offspring, the skeletal muscle protein abundance of glucose transporter 4 was 0.4-fold of the control.",
        "Esculetin (6,7-dihydroxycoumarin) is a natural coumarin with anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive activity. It acts as a potent inhibitor of lipoxygenases (5-LOX and 12-LOX) and decreases the production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, MMP-3 and MMP-9). Because both inhibition of lipoxygenases and inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases are effective strategies in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, we investigated whether esculetin may be effective in adjuvant-induced arthritis in rats.\n\nThe study was performed on male Lewis rats, in the adjuvant-induced arthritis model. Rats were divided into two groups: control (treated with 1% methylcellulose) and experimental (treated with esculetin - 10 mg/kg ip.). The tested compound was administered for 5 consecutive days starting on the 21\n\nThe LTB4 level in plasma of rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis is increased in comparison to rats without inflammation (362 \u00b134 vs. 274 \u00b115 pg/ml, ",
        "Septic arthritis of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is a rare condition known to result in significant morbidity if diagnosis is delayed. Acute otomastoiditis is a typical complication of acute otitis media but few cases of acute otomastoiditis complicated with TMJ arthritis have been reported in the international literature. Furthermore, otomastoiditis reports and studies rarely analyzed TMJ CT scans. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of TMJ arthritis in acute otomastoiditis, based on the analysis of CT scans.\n\nWe conducted a prospective study from 2014 to 2015, including all consecutive pediatric patients admitted to the Pediatric Otolaryngology department for acute otomastoiditis. A craniofacial injected CT scan was performed in all patients. The imagery was prospectively blind analyzed by two independent investigators screening for the criteria of TMJ arthritis. Finally, during the long-term follow-up we noted the number of patients presenting a clinical TMJ ankylosis.\n\nWe included 45 patients. The analysis showed 15 patients with TMJ effusion. Of those, 6 (13.33%) had an abscess and 2 clinical ankyloses.",
        "Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a common challenge in the world, and the platelet activation is enhanced in MetS patients. However, the fundamental mechanism that underlies platelet activation in MetS remains incompletely understood. Endothelial cells are damaged seriously in MetS patients, then they release more endothelial microparticles (EMPs). After all, whether the EMPs participate in platelet activation is still obscure. If they were, how did they work?\n\nWe demonstrated that the levels of EMPs, PMPs (platelet derived microparticles) and microparticle-carried-PDI activity increased in MetS patients. IR endothelial cells released more EMPs, the EMP-PDI was more activated. EMPs can enhance the activation of CD62P, GPIIb/IIIa and platelet aggregation and this process can be partly inhibited by PDI inhibitor such as RL90 and rutin. Activated platelets stimulated by EMPs expressed more PDI on cytoplasm and released more PMPs.\n\nWe obtained plasma from 23 MetS patients and 8 normal healthy controls. First we built insulin resistance (IR) model of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and then we separated EMPs from HUVECs culture medium and used these EMPs to stimulate platelets. Levels of microparticles, P-selectin(CD62P), Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) were detected by flow cytometry and levels of EMPs were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) activity was detected by insulin transhydrogenase assay. Platelet aggregation was assessed by turbidimetry.",
        "Galectin-3 (Gal-3), a \u03b2-galactoside-binding lectin, is increased in kidney injury and its pharmacological blockade reduces renal damage in acute kidney injury, hyperaldosteronism or hypertensive nephropathy. We herein investigated the effects of pharmacological Gal-3 inhibition by modified citrus pectin (MCP) in early renal damage associated with obesity and aortic stenosis (AS).\n\nGal-3 was upregulated in kidneys from high fat diet (HFD) rats and in animals with partial occlusion of ascending aorta (AS). Urinary and plasma neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and urinary albumin were enhanced in HFD and AS rats. In kidney from obese rats, fibrotic markers (collagen, TFG-\u03b2), epithelial-mesenchymal transition molecules (\u03b1-smooth muscle actin, E-cadherin), inflammatory mediator (osteopontin) and kidney injury marker (kidney injury molecule-1) were modified. In kidney from AS rats, fibrotic markers (collagen, CTGF), epithelial-mesenchymal transition molecules (fibronectin, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, \u03b2-catenin, E-cadherin) and kidney injury markers (NGAL, kidney injury molecule-1) were altered. Histologic observations of obese and AS rat kidneys revealed tubulointerstitial fibrosis. The pharmacological inhibition of Gal-3 with MCP normalized renal Gal-3 levels as well as functional, histological and molecular alterations in obese and AS rats.",
        "Mollusks display a striking morphological disparity, including, among others, worm-like animals (the aplacophorans), snails and slugs, bivalves, and cephalopods. This phenotypic diversity renders them ideal for studies into animal evolution. Despite being one of the most species-rich phyla, molecular and in silico studies concerning specific key developmental gene families are still scarce, thus hampering deeper insights into the molecular machinery that governs the development and evolution of the various molluscan class-level taxa.\n\nNext-generation sequencing was used to retrieve transcriptomes of representatives of seven out of the eight recent class-level taxa of mollusks. Similarity searches, phylogenetic inferences, and a detailed manual curation were used to identify and confirm the orthology of numerous molluscan Hox and ParaHox genes, which resulted in a comprehensive catalog that highlights the evolution of these genes in Mollusca and other metazoans. The identification of a specific molluscan motif in the Hox paralog group 5 and a lophotrochozoan ParaHox motif in the Gsx gene is described. Functional analyses using KEGG and GO tools enabled a detailed description of key developmental genes expressed in important pathways such as Hedgehog, Wnt, and Notch during development of the respective species. The KEGG analysis revealed Wnt8, Wnt11, and Wnt16 as Wnt genes hitherto not reported for mollusks, thereby enlarging the known Wnt complement of the phylum. In addition, novel Hedgehog (Hh)-related genes were identified in the gastropod Lottia cf. kogamogai, demonstrating a more complex gene content in this species than in other mollusks.",
        "Tendon is a mechanical tissue that transmits forces generated by muscle to bone in order to allow body motion. The molecular pathways that sense mechanical forces during tendon formation, homeostasis and repair are not known. EGR1 is a mechanosensitive transcription factor involved in tendon formation, homeostasis and repair. We hypothesized that EGR1 senses mechanical signals to promote tendon gene expression.\n\nUsing in vitro and in vivo models, we show that the expression of Egr1 and tendon genes is downregulated in 3D-engineered tendons made of mesenchymal stem cells when tension is released as well as in tendon homeostasis and healing when mechanical signals are reduced. We further demonstrate that EGR1 overexpression prevents tendon gene downregulation in 3D-engineered tendons when tension is released. Lastly, ultrasound and microbubbles mediated EGR1 overexpression prevents the downregulation of tendon gene expression during tendon healing in reduced load conditions."
