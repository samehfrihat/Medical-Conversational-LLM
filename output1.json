Rats were allocated into 2 groups; a control group (not treated) and L-Cit group (2 g/kg/day, L-Cit) and treated for 8 weeks.\n\nL-Cit enhanced the insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt in H4IIE cells. Moreover, the inhibited expression of Dex/cAMP-induced PEPCK mRNA by insulin was enhanced by the L-Cit treatment. The phosphorylation of tyrosine, which is upstream of Akt, in insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) was increased by the L-Cit treatment. The L-Cit-induced enhancement in insulin signaling was not related to the binding affinity of insulin to the insulin receptor or to the expression of the insulin receptor, but to a decrease in the phosphorylation of serine 1101 in IRS-1. These results were also confirmed in animal experiments. In the livers of L-Cit-treated rats, PI3K/Akt signaling was improved by decreases in the phosphorylation of serine 1101.",

As chaperones involved in the biogenesis of respiratory systems, the NarJ subfamily members are closely linked to the operons encoding the respiratory enzyme complexes they assist in maturing. This genetic association can lead to the divergence and specialization of NarJ subfamily members, as each operon may have unique requirements for chaperone function. Additionally, the diversity of respiratory enzyme complexes across different species and phyla can drive the evolution of NarJ subfamily members, as they adapt to new environmental conditions and metabolic pathways.

The CA4 co-operator was identified by immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry. CA4 downstream effectors and signaling pathways were elucidated by promoter luciferase assay, electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation. The clinical impact of CA4 was assessed in 115 patients with CRC. CA4 was silenced in all nine CRC cell lines and 92.6% of CRC tumors. The promoter hypermethylation contributed to the inactivation of CA4, and it was detected in 75.7% of the patients with CRC. After a median follow-up of 49.3 months, multivariate analysis showed that the patients with CA4 hypermethylation had a recurrence of Stage II/III CRC. The re-expression of CA4 inhibited cell proliferation, induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. CA4 inhibited the activity of the Wnt signaling pathway and mediated the degradation of \u03b2-catenin. CA4 interacted with Wilms' tumor 1-associating protein (WTAP) and induced WTAP protein degradation through polyubiquitination.

In silico calculations indicated that the sequence FGGR plays a substantial role in intersubunit interactions in FXIII-A2 homodimers. In agreement with this prediction, the temperature stability of delN-FXIII variants decreased with increasing length of deletion. These results may suggest a role of the N-terminus of AP-FXIII in dimer stability.",

        "The reliability of heart rate variables in the Vascular Quality Initiative as predictors of adverse cardiac outcomes or mortality after major elective vascular surgery is limited. While there were some associations found between heart rate variables and postoperative myocardial infarction, dysrhythmia, and 30-day death in certain patient populations and procedures, these associations disappeared when controlling for beta-blocker status. Additionally, no consistent associations were detected between heart rate variables and adverse cardiac outcomes or mortality across all three operations. Therefore, the use of heart rate variables alone may not be sufficient for predicting adverse cardiac outcomes or mortality after major elective vascular surgery, and further research is needed to identify more reliable predictors.",

        "The mucin MUC1, best known for providing an epithelial barrier, is an important protective host factor in both humans and mice during Helicobacter pylori pathogenesis. This study aimed to identify the long-term consequences of MUC1 deficiency on H. pylori pathogenesis and the mechanism by which MUC1 protects against H. pylori gastritis.\n\nWildtype and Muc1(-/-) mice were infected for up to 9 months, and the gastric pathology, immunological response and epigenetic changes assessed. The effects of MUC1 on the inflammasome, a potent inflammatory pathway, were examined in macrophages and H. pylori-infected mice deficient in both MUC1 and inflammasome components.\n\nMuc1(-/-) mice began to die 6 months after challenge, indicating Muc1 deficiency made H. pylori a lethal infection. Surprisingly, chimaeric mouse infections revealed MUC1 expression by haematopoietic-derived immune cells limits H. pylori-induced gastritis. Gastritis in infected Muc1(-/-) mice was associated with elevated interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and epigenetic changes in their gastric mucosa similar to those in transgenic mice overexpressing gastric IL-1\u03b2, implicating MUC1 regulation of an inflammasome. In support of this, infected Muc1(-/-)Casp1(-/-) mice did not develop severe gastritis. Further, MUC1 regulated Nlrp3 expression via an nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB-dependent pathway and reduced NF-\u03baB pathway activation via inhibition of IRAK4 phosphorylation. The importance of this regulation was proven using Muc1(-/-)Nlrp3(-/-) mice, which did not develop severe gastritis.",

The stability of DNAzyme was determined in vitro and in vivo using fluorescently labeled DNAzyme.\n\nAM9D specifically inhibited expression of MMP-9 in MDA-MB-231 cells resulting in reduced invasive property of these cells by 43%. Weekly intratumoral treatment of spontaneously developed mammary tumors in MMTV-PyMT transgenic mice was sufficient to significantly reduce the rate of tumor growth and final tumor load in a dose dependent and statistically significant manner (P < 0.05). This decrease in tumor growth was correlated with decreased MMP-9 protein production within the treated tumor tissues.

        "The lateral approach in total knee arthroplasty for valgus deformed knees has been shown to have several advantages, including:\n\n1. Improved postoperative flexion: The lateral approach allows for better access to the posterior compartment of the knee, which can lead to improved postoperative flexion compared to the medial approach.\n\n2. Easier release of soft tissues: The lateral approach provides a more direct route for releasing the iliotibial band and other soft tissues, which can make the procedure easier and less time-consuming.\n\n3. Better visualization of the joint: The lateral approach allows for better visualization of the joint, which can lead to more precise implant positioning and better alignment.\n\n4. Reduced risk of damage to the popliteal artery: The lateral approach is less likely to damage the popliteal artery, which can be a concern with the medial approach in cases of severe valgus deformity.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the lateral approach also has some disadvantages, such as a higher risk of damage to the lateral collateral ligament and a longer learning curve for surgeons who are not familiar with the technique. Ultimately, the choice between the medial and lateral approaches will depend on the individual patient's anatomy and the surgeon's experience and preference.",

        "Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that measures the diffusion of water molecules in tissue. In breast cancer, DWI has been shown to be a useful tool for assessing the pathological therapeutic response and predicting relapse after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC).\n\nThe apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) is a quantitative measure derived from DWI that reflects the Brownian motion of water molecules in tissue. In breast cancer, the ADC value of a tumor is generally lower than that of normal breast tissue, indicating restricted diffusion of water molecules within the tumor due to the presence of cellular membranes and other barriers.\n\nAfter NAC, the ADC value of a tumor can increase, indicating an increase in the diffusion of water molecules and a corresponding decrease in the size and density of the tumor. This increase in ADC value has been shown to correlate with the pathological response to NAC, with higher ADC values associated with a better response.\n\nIn addition, studies have shown that the change in ADC value after NAC can predict the risk of relapse. Patients with a larger increase in ADC value after NAC have been shown to have a lower risk of relapse, while those with a smaller increase in ADC value have been shown to have a higher risk of relapse.\n\nOverall, DWI and ADC measurements provide valuable information about the pathological therapeutic response and the risk of relapse in breast cancer, and can be used to guide treatment decisions and monitor the effectiveness of therapy.",

MG is known to act as an endogenous \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptor agonist, and GLO1 plays a crucial role in regulating the levels of MG in the brain. In this study, the authors investigated the role of MG and GLO1 in regulating seizure susceptibility in mice. They found that pretreatment with MG attenuated seizures induced by picrotoxin or pilocarpine, and that inhibition of GLO1, which increases MG concentration in vivo, also attenuated seizures. Furthermore, they observed that high Glo1 expression was correlated with increased seizure susceptibility in BXD recombinant inbred mice, and that transgenic mice overexpressing Glo1 displayed reduced MG concentration in the brain and increased seizure severity. These findings suggest that GLO1 and MG play a crucial role in regulating seizure susceptibility, and that targeting this pathway may provide a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of epilepsy.",

By solving two simultaneous equations for the formula applied to the data for stage (1) IA and (2) IIIA in the LACE study, X and Y were 2.6 and 1.9, respectively. When these values were applied in the formula for stage IB patients in the same study, the theoretical (-2.3 %) and reported values (2.5 %) were close. When these were applied for stage IB-IIIA patients in the IALT study, the theoretical (5.0 %) and reported values (4.1 %) were also similar.",

        "The growth medium and support type have a significant impact on the biofilm-forming ability and ultrastructure of Pleurotus ostreatus. In this study, sucrose-asparagine (SA) was found to be the most conducive growth medium for biofilm production, while hydrophilic and mild hydrophobic supports were more suitable for biofilm attachment compared to hydrophobic supports. Additionally, the growth medium had a greater impact on biofilm ultrastructure than the support type, with biofilms developed on SA showing a high compactness. These findings suggest that the choice of growth medium and support type can significantly affect the biofilm-forming ability and ultrastructure of Pleurotus ostreatus, and should be carefully considered in biofilm-related applications.",

The findings indicate that TAC1 methylation was significantly associated with p16, E-cadherin, and galanin methylation, as well as disease-free survival. Additionally, TAC1 promoter hypermethylation was correlated with reduced disease-free survival, and methylation of TAC1 and TACR1 was associated with an increased odds ratio for recurrence. These results suggest that TAC1 and TACR1 methylation may have prognostic significance and value as a biomarker of recurrence in head and neck cancer.",

        "The natural allelic diversity of the differentially regulated genes TvQR1 and TvPirin of the parasitic plant Triphysaria can be inferred from the text as follows:\n\nTvQR1 exhibited remarkably higher molecular diversity and more recombination events than TvPirin, with the highest non-synonymous substitution rate in the substrate recognition and catalytic domain of the TvQR1 protein. This suggests that TvQR1 has undergone more rapid evolution and has a higher rate of genetic change compared to TvPirin.\n\nThe higher molecular diversity and recombination events in TvQR1 could be due to its role in generating the active haustorium-inducing factor (HIF) from DMBQ, which is critical for the parasitic plant's ability to invade and deprive host plants of water and nutrients. This suggests that TvQR1 may have evolved more rapidly to adapt to different host plants or environmental conditions.\n\nTvPirin, on the other hand, encodes a protein shorter than the one previously reported, and its natural nucleotide diversity is lower than that of TvQR1. This suggests that TvPirin may have a more conserved function and has undergone less rapid evolution compared to TvQR1.\n\nOverall, the natural allelic diversity of TvQR1 and TvPirin suggests that TvQR1 has undergone more rapid evolution and has a higher rate of genetic change compared to TvPirin, possibly due to its critical role in the parasitic plant's ability to invade and deprive host plants of resources.",

        "Sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, has been shown to modulate the crosstalk between macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells in the tumor microenvironment. By inhibiting the activity of several kinases involved in cell signaling pathways, sorafenib can alter the polarization of macrophages towards a more anti-tumor phenotype, promoting the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3). These cytokines can then activate NK cells, enhancing their cytotoxic activity against tumor cells. Additionally, sorafenib has been shown to increase the expression of NK cell-activating ligands on the surface of tumor cells, further enhancing NK cell-mediated tumor cell killing. Overall, sorafenib's ability to modulate the crosstalk between macrophages and NK cells helps to create a more favorable tumor microenvironment for anticancer effector functions.",

        "The protective effect of de novo synthesized estradiol on methylmercury-induced neurotoxicity in cultured rat hippocampal slices was examined. The neurotoxic effect of methylmercury on hippocampal organotypic slice culture was quantified by propidium iodide fluorescence imaging. Twenty-four-hour treatment of the slices with methylmercury caused cell death in a dose-dependent manner. The toxicity of methylmercury was attenuated by pre-treatment with exogenously added estradiol. The slices de novo synthesized estradiol. The estradiol synthesis was not affected by treatment with 1 \u00b5M methylmercury. The toxicity of methylmercury was enhanced by inhibition of de novo estradiol synthesis, and the enhancement of toxicity was recovered by the addition of exogenous estradiol. The neuroprotective effect of estradiol was inhibited by an estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist, and mimicked by pre-treatment of the slices with agonists for ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2, indicating the neuroprotective effect was mediated by ERs.",

This study analyzed the value of transcatheter angiographic embolization (TAE) for persistent haemodynamic instability after initial fracture stabilization.\n\nFrom January 2002 to July 2011, 803 patients were identified with pelvic fractures, 295 of them (37%) were presenting with unstable pelvic fractures. Fifteen patients, all with unstable fractures (2%), remained hypotensive (systolic blood pressure<90 mmHg) despite adequate fluid resuscitation and emergent surgical fracture stabilization, subsequently underwent TAE.\n\nThe median age in the TAE-group was 57.9 years\u00b120.12 (min 22; max 82) and the median ISS (injury severity score) was 35.8\u00b111.7 (min 22; max 66). 13 out of 15 patients (87%) received initial external fixation and 2 patients (13%) where treated with a C-Clamp before TAE. Radiological success, defined as absence of contrast extravasation on completion angiography, was observed in all 15 patients. In total 3 (20%) patients died during the period of hospitalization, none of them owing to persistent or recurrent pelvic haemorrhage.

In vitro studies have shown that sildenafil can inhibit the activity of these transporters, leading to increased accumulation of chemotherapeutic drugs in cancer cells and potentially enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy.\n\nHowever, in vivo studies have produced mixed results. While some studies have shown that sildenafil can increase the brain penetration of chemotherapeutic drugs in animal models, other studies have found no significant effect on drug penetration or have even observed decreased drug penetration. Additionally, the effects of sildenafil on the efficacy of chemotherapy in vivo have been inconsistent, with some studies showing improved tumor response and others showing no effect or even worsened tumor response.\n\nThe implications of these findings for the clinical use of sildenafil as a modulator of ABCB1 and ABCG2-mediated drug resistance are not yet clear. Further research is needed to better understand the mechanisms of action of sildenafil in vivo and to determine its potential clinical utility in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of cancer.",

The model exhibits signs of hemorrhagic stroke (HS) subsequent to chronic inflammation and hypertension. HS is also associated with the inability of middle cerebral arteries to undergo pressure dependent constriction (PDC). We investigated alterations in the cerebrovasculature of our hypertensive mono-arthritic animals that develop stroke.\n\nAnimals were fed either a high salt diet (HSD) (4% NaCl) or Purina chow (0.58% NaCl) from weaning. Complete Freund\"s Adjuvant (CFA) was injected into the left hind paw at 21-28 weeks; controls received saline and histological and functional studies were performed.\n\nBrain damage was more prominent with the high salt, with inflammation exacerbating the damage.

        "There are several indications that the composition of the tumor stroma can contribute to the malignancy of a tumor. Here we utilized expression data sets to identify metagenes that may serve as surrogate marker for the extent of matrix production and vascularization of a tumor and to characterize prognostic molecular components of the stroma.\n\nTCGA data sets from six cancer forms, two breast cancer microarray sets and one mRNA data set of xenografted tumors were downloaded. Using the mean correlation as distance measure compact clusters with genes representing extracellular matrix production (ECM metagene) and vascularization (endothelial metagene) were defined. Explorative Cox modeling was used to identify prognostic stromal gene sets.\n\nClustering of stromal genes in six cancer data sets resulted in metagenes, each containing three genes, representing matrix production and vascularization. The ECM metagene was associated with poor prognosis in renal clear cell carcinoma and in lung adenocarcinoma but not in other cancers investigated. Explorative Cox modeling using gene pairs identified gene sets that in multivariate models were prognostic in breast cancer. This was validated in two microarray sets. Two notable genes are TCF4 and P4HA3 which were included in the sets associated with positive and negative prognosis, respectively. Data from laser-microdissected tumors, a xenografted tumor data set and from correlation analyses demonstrate the stroma specificity of the genes.",

        "Heterogeneity and niche adaptation in bacterial biofilm involve changes to the genetic makeup of the bacteria and gene expression control. We hypothesized that i) spontaneous mutations in the flhD operon can either increase or decrease motility and that ii) the resulting motility heterogeneity in the biofilm might lead to a long-term increase in biofilm biomass.\n\nWe allowed the highly motile E. coli K-12 strain MC1000 to form seven- and fourteen-day old biofilm, from which we recovered reduced motility isolates at a substantially greater frequency (5.4\\xa0%) than from a similar experiment with planktonic bacteria (0.1\\xa0%). Biofilms formed exclusively by MC1000 degraded after 2\\xa0weeks. In contrast, biofilms initiated with a 1:1 ratio of MC1000 and its isogenic flhD::kn mutant remained intact at 4\\xa0weeks and the two strains remained in equilibrium for at least two weeks. These data imply that an \"optimal\" biofilm may contain a mixture of motile and non-motile bacteria. Twenty-eight of the non-motile MC1000 isolates contained an IS1 element in proximity to the translational start of FlhD or within the open reading frames for FlhD or FlhC. Two isolates had an IS2 and one isolate had an IS5 in the open reading frame for FlhD. An additional three isolates contained deletions that included the RNA polymerase binding site, five isolates contained point mutations and small deletions in the open reading frame for FlhC. The locations of all these mutations are consistent with the lack of motility and further downstream within the flhD operon than previously published IS elements that increased motility. We believe that the location of the mutation within the flhD operon determines whether the effect on motility is positive or negative. To test the second part of our hypothesis where motility heterogeneity in a biofilm may lead to a long-term increase in biofilm biomass, we quantified biofilm biomass by MC1000, MC1000 flhD::kn, and mixtures of the two strains at ratios of 1:1, 10:1, and 1:10. After 3 weeks, biofilm of the mixed cultures contained up to five times more biomass than biofilm of each of the individual strains.",
        "Dystonia is a movement disorder with patterned, directional, and often sustained muscle contractions that produce abnormal postures or repetitive movements. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) is an effective and safe treatment for medically refractory dystonia. However, recent studies reported gait problems, gait freezing and falls in patients treated with DBS. Because these symptoms may point to deficient gait initiation processes, we systematically assessed the anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) prior to stepping in dystonia patients with GPi-DBS.\n\nThirteen patients with focal/segmental dystonia under GPi-DBS and twelve healthy control subjects were included in the study. Data were collected using pressure sensitive sensors and APAs were studied by centre of pressure measures. We compared APAs of both groups and analysed the influence of GPi-DBS on APAs in patients.\n\nMedio-lateral and antero-posterior COP displacements, total COP path, maximal APA velocity and 1st step length were all smaller in patients for both ON (p=0.006, p=0.018, p=0.002, p=0.016, p=0.04) and OFF (p=0.001, p=0.01, p=0.001, p=0.03, p=0.024) condition compared to healthy subjects.

        "Hydrocyanines are widely used as fluorogenic probes to monitor reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in cells. Their brightness, stability to autoxidation and photobleaching, large signal change upon oxidation, pH independence and red/near infrared emission are particularly attractive for imaging ROS in live tissue.\n\nUsing confocal fluorescence microscopy we have examined an interference of mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m) with fluorescence intensity and localisation of a commercial hydro-Cy3 probe in respiring and non-respiring colon carcinoma HCT116 cells.\n\nWe found that the oxidised (fluorescent) form of hydro-Cy3 is highly homologous to the common \u0394\u03a8m-sensitive probe JC-1, which accumulates and aggregates only in \"energised\" negatively charged mitochondrial matrix. Therefore, hydro-Cy3 oxidised by hydroxyl and superoxide radicals tends to accumulate in mitochondrial matrix, but dissipates and loses brightness as soon as \u0394\u03a8m is compromised. Experiments with mitochondrial inhibitor oligomycin and uncoupler FCCP, as well as a common ROS producer paraquat demonstrated that signals of the oxidised hydro-Cy3 probe rapidly and strongly decrease upon mitochondrial depolarisation, regardless of the rate of cellular ROS production.",

        "Obesity-related diseases are major contributors to morbidity and mortality in the developed world. Molecular diagnostics and targets of therapies to combat nutritional imbalance are urgently needed in the clinic. Invertebrate animals have been a cornerstone of basic research efforts to dissect the genetics of metabolism and nutrient response. We set out to use fruit flies reared on restricted and nutrient-rich diets to identify genes associated with starvation resistance, body mass and composition, in a survey of genetic variation across the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP).\n\nWe measured starvation resistance, body weight and composition in DGRP lines on each of two diets and used several association mapping strategies to harness this panel of phenotypes for molecular insights. We tested DNA sequence variants for a relationship with single metabolic traits and with multiple traits at once, using a scheme for cross-phenotype association mapping; we focused our association tests on homologs of human disease genes and common polymorphisms; and we tested for gene-by-diet interactions. The results revealed gene and gene-by-diet associations between 17 variants and body mass, whole-body triglyceride and glucose content, or starvation resistance. Focused molecular experiments validated the role in body mass of an uncharacterized gene, CG43921 (which we rename heavyweight), and previously unknown functions for the diacylglycerol kinase rdgA, the huntingtin homolog htt, and the ceramide synthase schlank in nutrient-dependent body mass, starvation resistance, and lifespan.",

For rectal cancer, neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) followed by radical proctectomy is gold standard treatment for patients with stage II/III rectal cancer. By data mining a public dataset of rectal cancer transcriptome (GSE35452) from Gene Expression Omnibus, National Center of Biotechnology Information (GEO, NCBI), we identified that VNN1 was the most significantly upregulated gene among those related to nitrogen compound metabolic process (GO:0006807). Therefore, we analyzed the clinicopathological correlation and prognostic impact of VNN1 protein (pantetheinase), which encoded by VNN1 gene.\n\nVNN1 immunostaining was performed in 172 rectal adenocarcinomas treated with preoperative CCRT followed by surgery, which were bisected into high- and low-expression subgroups. Furthermore, statistical analyses were performed to correlate the relationship between VNN1 immunoreactivity and clinicopathological features, as well as three survival indices: disease-specific survival (DSS), local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) and metastasis-free survival (MeFS).\n\nHigh VNN1 immunoexpression was significantly associated with advanced pre-treatment and post-treatment disease and poor response to CCRT (all P \u2264 .026). In addition, VNN1 overexpression was linked to adverse DSS, LRFS and MeFS in univariate analysis and served as an independent prognosticator indicating worse DSS and LRFS in multivariate analysis (all P \u2264 .019).",
        "Streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the leading causes of community acquired pneumonia and acute otitis media. Certain aspects of S. pneumoniae\"s virulence are dependent upon expression and release of the protein toxin pneumolysin (PLY) and upon the activity of the peroxide-producing enzyme, pyruvate oxidase (SpxB). We investigated the possible synergy of these two proteins and identified that release of PLY is enhanced by expression of SpxB prior to stationary phase growth.\n\nMutants lacking the spxB gene were defective in PLY release and complementation of spxB restored PLY release. This was demonstrated by cytotoxic effects of sterile filtered supernatants upon epithelial cells and red blood cells. Additionally, peroxide production appeared to contribute to the mechanism of PLY release since a significant correlation was found between peroxide production and PLY release among a panel of clinical isolates.

Primary endpoints of 30-day overall morbidity and mortality were evaluated via univariate and multivariate analysis.\n\nOf the 2,119 patients identified for study inclusion, 57.2\\xa0% (n\\xa0=\\xa01212) underwent emergent operative intervention within 24\\xa0h, 26.3\\xa0% (n\\xa0=\\xa0558) between days 1-3, 12.9\\xa0% (n\\xa0=\\xa0273) between days 3-7, and 3.6\\xa0% (n\\xa0=\\xa076) greater than 7\\xa0days from admission. End colostomy was performed in 77.4\\xa0% (n\\xa0=\\xa01,640) of cases. Unadjusted age and presence of major comorbidities increased with operative delay. Further, unadjusted 30-day overall morbidity, mortality, septic complications, and post-operative length of stay increased significantly with operative delay. On multivariate analysis, operative delay was not associated with increased 30-day mortality but was associated with increased 30-day overall morbidity.",
        "When a child is diagnosed with epilepsy, not only has the child\"s life been disrupted but also the family\"s sense of normalcy. Although there is considerable literature discussing family concerns and social support issues in families with chronically ill children, a major gap lies in the exploration of how the specifics of childhood epilepsy affect parents and family operations. The purpose of this study was to identify psychosocial care needs of parents of children with epilepsy.\n\nUtilizing the Family Systems Nursing theory as a framework, this correlation study examined the relationships among social and community support, family needs, family empowerment, and family quality of life in 29 primary caregivers of a child with epilepsy.\n\nThese families felt highly supported; they had low needs and high perceptions of empowerment. There was a negative association between social supports and the total family needs survey scale and the subscales of financial support, help regarding explaining to others, and professional support. There was no association between family empowerment or quality of life with parental perceptions of social support.",
        "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes for the respiratory chain proteins. Genetic alterations in mtDNA have been described during aging and linked to impaired hematopoiesis.\n\nWe investigated two novel conplastic mouse strains harboring a mitochondrial nt7778 G/T polymorphism leading to an amino acid exchange in respiratory chain complex V. Effects on reactive oxygen species (ROS) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, as well as bone marrow composition and peripheral blood counts, were investigated during aging (up to 24 month).\n\nThe polymorphism correlated with significantly decreased ROS levels in aged mice. Effects on hematopoiesis were marginal and not statistically significant: numbers of erythroid cells in bone marrow, as well as mean corpuscular hemoglobin, tended to decrease over time.",
        "Various effects on tumor cells have been described for zoledronic acid (ZOL). However, only limited data exist regarding its influence on the motility of tumor cells. Since migration of tumor stem cells is a decisive step in metastasis, we examined whether ZOL reduces their motility.\n\nWe investigated the effects of ZOL on stem-like progenitor cells obtained via the formation of spheroids from the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB 231. Stem cell properties were verified by measurement of high CD44 expression and absence of CD24 expression. Motility was explored by time-resolved videography, protein expression by western blotting.\n\nZOL strongly reduced the migration of stem-like progenitor cells. Cellular velocity was reduced by 61% following exposure to 1 \u03bcM ZOL and by 82% after exposure to 10 \u03bcM ZOL. Accumulated distance traveled by the cells was reduced by 60% and 79% after exposure to 1 \u03bcM and 10 \u03bcM ZOL, respectively. The remaining cellular motility led to very little change in distance, with cellular activity appearing more as \"stepping on the spot\". The reduced motility might be due to reduced phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), an important enzyme in cellular migration.",
        "Anvillea garcinii Coss. & Durieu (Anv) plant is used as a traditional North African medicine against several diseases associated with inflammation. At inflammatory sites, reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced in excess by activated phagocyte NADPH oxidase (NOX2) can accentuate inflammatory responses. Thus, we investigated if Anv-water soluble polysaccharides could modulate primary human neutrophil oxidative burst in vitro.\n\nHuman neutrophils were isolated from fresh whole blood and O\n\nWater soluble polysaccharides from Anv dose-dependently inhibited N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLF)- and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-induced O",
        "Radiofrequency microtenotomy (RM) is effective for treating plantar fasciitis. No studies have compared it to the plantar fasciotomy (PF). We hypothesized that RM is equally effective and provides no additional benefit when performed with PF.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2014, all patients who underwent either or both procedures concurrently at our institution were analyzed. Data collected included demographics, SF-36 Health Survey, AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot Scale, and two questions regarding satisfaction and expectations, all of which were assessed pre-operatively and post-operatively at 6-months and 1-year. ANOVA with Bonferroni correction was used to compare scores at each interval. Logistic regression was used to identify pre-operative factors that predicted for satisfaction and expectations.\n\nThere were no differences in patient outcomes. No pre-operative factors predicted for satisfaction and expectations.",
        "The induction of alcohol fermentation in roots is a plant adaptive response to flooding stress and oxygen deprivation. Available transcriptomic data suggest that fermentation-related genes are also frequently induced in roots infected with gall forming pathogens, but the biological significance of this induction is unclear. In this study, we addressed the role of hypoxia responses in Arabidopsis roots during infection by the clubroot agent Plasmodiophora brassicae.\n\nThe hypoxia-related gene markers PYRUVATE DECARBOXYLASE 1 (PDC1), PYRUVATE DECARBOXYLASE 2 (PDC2) and ALCOHOL DEHYDROGENASE 1 (ADH1) were induced during secondary infection by two isolates of P. brassicae, eH and e2. PDC2 was highly induced as soon as 7\\xa0days post inoculation (dpi), i.e., before the development of gall symptoms, and GUS staining revealed that ADH1 induction was localised in infected cortical cells of root galls at 21 dpi. Clubroot symptoms were significantly milder in the pdc1 and pdc2 mutants compared with Col-0, but a null T-DNA insertional mutation of ADH1 did not affect clubroot susceptibility. The Arg/N-end rule pathway of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis controls oxygen sensing in plants. Mutants of components of this pathway, ate1 ate2 and prt6, that both exhibit constitutive hypoxia responses, showed enhanced clubroot symptoms. In contrast, gall development was reduced in quintuple and sextuple mutants where the activity of all oxygen-sensing Group VII Ethylene Response Factor transcription factors (ERFVIIs) is absent (erfVII and prt6 erfVII).",
        "Sarcopenia is a well-known complication of protein energy wasting in hemodialysis patients. Its diagnosis requires measurements of muscle mass and muscle function. Few studies have reported its prevalence in hemodialysis patients. In this study, we report the prevalence of sarcopenia in this population and evaluate the performance of other parameters for its diagnosis.\n\nIn this observational cross-sectional study, data from hemodialysis patients from our nephrology department were recorded. Body composition measured by bioimpedancemetry analysis and muscle strength measured by handgrip were recorded. Normal values for sarcopenia were those recommended by the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP).\n\nThe median age (interquartile range) of the 111 patients was 77.5 (70.8-84.8) years. A large majority of 88.3% (n\\xa0=\\xa098) of patients had a low muscle strength; a low muscle mass index was present in 33.3% (n\\xa0=\\xa037) of the population. Finally, 31.5% (n\\xa0=\\xa035) of patients had sarcopenia. These latter were older, had longer dialysis vintage, lower BMI, mid-arm circumference and mid-leg circumference, and a lower prealbumin. The best parameter predicting sarcopenia was BMI (ROC curve AUC of 0.79 [0.68-0.91] (p\\xa0<\\xa00.001) in men and 0.81 [0.68-0.93] (p\\xa0=\\xa00.003) in women). Mid-arm circumference predicted sarcopenia, but was less accurate than BMI. Mid-leg circumference predicted sarcopenia only in men. Predialysis creatinine or creatinine index could not predict sarcopenia.",
        "The activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) is a key event in fibrotic pathogenesis. However, the mechanism involving activation of HSCs in chronic schistosomiasis is not entirely clear.\n\nHuman HSC LX-2 and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (ECs) were cultured with Schistosoma japonicum (S. japonicum) antigens (SA) in vitro. Fibrosis-associated genes and cell proliferation were analyzed. HSCs were isolated from mice of chronic schistosomiasis with or without praziquantel (PZQ) treatment, followed by the microarray analysis for the liver fibrosis-associated pathways.\n\nAlthough SA inhibited the activation and proliferation of HSCs, it induced the EC proliferation and vascular endothelial growth factor-a (VEGF) production. VEGF significantly increased the proliferation of HSCs and up-regulated the expression of collagen and smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA). For in vivo study, we found several fibrosis-associated pathways were involved in the HSCs during the reversal of liver fibrosis caused by schistosomiasis, including VEGF, PDGF, TNF and ET-1 pathways. The Ingenuity Pathway Analysis showed that VEGF directly regulated several pro-fibrotic and immune cytokine genes in HSCs, including integrin, fibronectin, IFN-\u03b3, IL-6 and IL-10.",
        "Combinations of adjuvant sensitizers with anticancer drugs is a promising new strategy to reverse chemoresistance. Ursolic acid (UA) is one of the natural pentacyclic triterpene compounds known to have many pharmacological characteristics such as anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties. This study investigates whether UA can sensitize hepatocellular carcinoma cells to cisplatin.\n\nCells were transfected with nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) small interfering RNA and Nrf2 complementary DNA by using Lipofectin 2000. The cytotoxicity of cells was investigated by Cell Counting Kit 8 assay. Cell apoptosis, cell cycle, reactive oxygen species, and mitochondrial membrane potential were detected by flow cytometry fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The protein level of Nrf2, NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), glutathione \n\nThe results showed that the reverse index was 2.9- and 9.69-fold by UA of 1.125 \u03bcg/mL and 2.25 \u03bcg/mL, respectively, for cisplatin to HepG2/DDP cells. UA-cisplatin combination induced cell apoptosis and reactive oxygen species, blocked the cell cycle in G0/G1 phase, and reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential. Mechanistically, UA-cisplatin dramatically decreased the expression of Nrf2 and its downstream genes. The sensibilization of UA-cisplatin combination was diminished in Nrf2 small interfering RNA-transfected HepG2/DDP cells, as well as in Nrf2 complementary DNA-transfected HepG2/DDP cells.",
        "The several-micrometer-sized Toxoplasma gondii protozoan parasite invades virtually any type of nucleated cell from a warm-blooded animal within seconds. Toxoplasma initiates the formation of a tight ring-like junction bridging its apical pole with the host cell membrane. The parasite then actively moves through the junction into a host cell plasma membrane invagination that delineates a nascent vacuole. Recent high resolution imaging and kinematics analysis showed that the host cell cortical actin dynamics occurs at the site of entry while gene silencing approaches allowed motor-deficient parasites to be generated, and suggested that the host cell could contribute energetically to invasion. In this study we further investigate this possibility by analyzing the behavior of parasites genetically impaired in different motor components, and discuss how the uncovered mechanisms illuminate our current understanding of the invasion process by motor-competent parasites.\n\nBy simultaneously tracking host cell membrane and cortex dynamics at the site of interaction with myosin A-deficient Toxoplasma, the junction assembly step could be decoupled from the engagement of the Toxoplasma invasive force. Kinematics combined with functional analysis revealed that myosin A-deficient Toxoplasma had a distinct host cell-dependent mode of entry when compared to wild-type or myosin B/C-deficient Toxoplasma. Following the junction assembly step, the host cell formed actin-driven membrane protrusions that surrounded the myosin A-deficient mutant and drove it through the junction into a typical vacuole. However, this parasite-entry mode appeared suboptimal, with about 40\\xa0% abortive events for which the host cell membrane expansions failed to cover the parasite body and instead could apply deleterious compressive forces on the apical pole of the zoite.",
        "Multiple oxysterols (OHCs) have demonstrated the ability to act as agonists or antagonists of the hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway, a developmental signaling pathway that has been implicated as a potential therapeutic target in a variety of human diseases. These OHCs are known to modulate Hh signaling through direct binding interactions with the N-terminal cysteine rich domain (CRD) of Smoothened, a key regulator of Hh signal transduction.\n\nHomology modeling, molecular dynamics simulations, and MM/GBSA energy calculations were utilized to explore binding interactions between the OHC scaffold and the human Smoothened CRD. Follow-up cellular assays explored the in vitro activity of potential Hh pathway modulators.\n\nStructural features that govern key molecular interactions between the Smoothened CRD and the OHC scaffold were identified. Orientation of the iso-octyl side chain as well as the overall entropy of the OHC-CRD complex are important for determining activity against the Hh pathway. OHC 9, which was previously thought to be inactive because it was not an Hh agonist, was identified as an inhibitor of Hh signal transmission.",
        "We investigated the association between hand dysfunction and ultrasound (US)-detected articular synovitis and tenosynovitis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).\n\nThirty RA patients were examined. In both hands of all subjects, articular synovitis and tenosynovitis were assessed by US at 22 joints and 12 tendons. Each joint and tendon was scored by gray-scale (GS) and power Doppler (PD) on a scale from 0 to 3. The sums of the GS or PD scores were used as the articular synovitis score and the tenosynovitis score. The sum of the articular synovitis and tenosynovitis scores was used as the combined US score. Hand dysfunction was evaluated by a grip-Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and visual analog scale of morning stiffness (MS-VAS). We used Spearman\"s correlation coefficient to determine the relationships among the US scores, the two hand dysfunction indices, and the DAS28-ESR.\n\nThe articular synovitis scores were significantly correlated with grip-HAQ (GS: r",
        "The French health authorities recommend systematic screening for Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) urogenital infections in dedicated sexual health centers (planning centers) for women under 25\\xa0years old and for women who have changed partners during the last year. The two main purposes of this study were to assess adherence to this recommendation in planning centers and to identify possible obstacles to this screening.\n\nWe conducted an observational prospective study from April to August\\xa02013\\xa0in planning centers of Poitou-Charentes. Data on declarative screening practices and possible obstacles to Ct screening were collected qualitatively. Real center practices were also recorded to assess conformity with guidelines. Quantitative data were collected about real activities in each center. Screening percentage among women younger than 25\\xa0years and among those who had changed partners during the year was computed for each center. The main endpoint was percentage of centers that did not follow the recommendations. Declared practices were compared to observational practices using real practices data.\n\nTwelve out of 17\\xa0planning centers in the region participated. Six centers declared they performed systematic screening for Ct infection in women under 25\\xa0and 2\\xa0centers in women who had changed partners during the year. No center fully complied with the recommendations. Forty-three percent (601/1390) of women with standard screening criteria were screened and 52\\xa0% (102/197) of women without these criteria were screened. Depending on the center, declared practices could overestimate or underestimate the observed practices. The declared obstacles were lack of time, patient refusal, budget issues and no specific organization.",
        "To analyze overall survival (OS) rates for the three curative treatments of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis.\n\nCohort study based on data from a multidisciplinary team meeting (MDT) dedicated to HCC. From 2006 to 2013, we included every patient with newly diagnosed HCC, for whom curative treatment (liver transplantation (LT), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), surgical resection (SR)) was decided upon.\n\nWe included 387 consecutive patients. LT was decided in 136 cases, RFA in 131 cases, SR in 120 cases. Sixty-six percent of patients received the planned treatment. Five-year OS on an ITT basis were: 35% for the LT-group, 32% for the RFA-group, 34% for the SR-group (P\\u2009=\\u20090.77). In multivariate analyses, the main negative prognostic factors were not following the MDT decision (HR: 0.39, CI95% [0.27-0.54], P\\u2009<\\u20090.001), elevated alpha-fetoprotein level (HR: 0.63, CI95% [0.45-0.87], P\\u2009=\\u20090.005), being outside the Milan criteria (HR: 0.45, CI95% [0.31-0.65], P\\u2009<\\u20090.001). When curative treatment was performed, per-protocol 5-year OS were 64% for LT, 34% for RFA, 40% for SR.",
        "To compare the adenoma detection rate (ADR) during colonoscopy in patients with melanosis coli against matched controls without melanosis.\n\nMelanosis coli is a colonoscopic finding in which the colon wall appears darkly pigmented, most often due to extended laxative use, and is considered benign. The pigmentation spares adenomas, which should therefore be more readily detectable in melanosis coli.\n\nWe identified all patients with melanosis on colonoscopy at our institution over a 5-year period. We matched each patient with 2 controls by age, gender, and endoscopist. We compared the prevalence of adenomas between groups, and used multivariable analysis, adjusting for procedure indication and bowel preparation quality, to determine the independent association of melanosis with adenoma detection.\n\nAt least 1 adenoma was detected in 34.7% of melanosis patients and 26.5% of controls [odds ratio (OR)=1.52; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.04-2.24; P=0.03]. On multivariable analysis, the presence of melanosis remained associated with increased adenoma detection (OR=1.56; 95% CI, 1.05-2.33; P=0.03). Melanosis patients were more likely to have an adenoma \u22645 mm (OR=1.62; 95% CI, 1.04-2.51; P=0.03), but not adenomas 6 to 9 mm or \u226510 mm.",
        "The burden of asthma and rhinitis on health-related quality of life (HRQL) among adults has been assessed mainly in studies of patients seeking health-care, while population-based studies are relatively scarce. The objective of this study was to investigate HRQL among subjects with asthma and rhinitis derived from a random population sample and to identify factors related to impairment of HRQL.\n\nA randomly selected cohort was invited to participate in a postal questionnaire survey. Of those who responded, a stratified sample of 1016 subjects was invited to clinical examinations and interviews, and 737 subjects in ages 21-86 years participated. Of these, 646 completed HRQL questions. HRQL was assessed with the generic SF-36 Health Survey.\n\nThe physical score was lower among subjects with asthma vs. subjects without asthma (p\\xa0<\\xa00.001). No significant difference was found in the mental score. Subjects with well-controlled asthma had higher physical score compared to subjects with partly and un-controlled asthma (p\\xa0=\\xa00.002). Actually, subjects with well-controlled asthma had similar physical HRQL as subjects without asthma. Asthmatics who were current smokers had lower physical score compared to those who were non-smokers (p\\xa0=\\xa00.021). No significant differences in physical or mental scores were found between subjects with and without rhinitis. Subjects with both asthma and rhinitis had lower physical score compared to subjects without these conditions (p\\xa0<\\xa00.001), but subjects with asthma alone had even worse physical score.",
        "Chronic obstructive defecation can occur in patients with Hirschsprung Disease (HD) and internal anal sphincter (IAS) achalasia. Injection of Botulinum Toxin (BoTox) into the IAS can temporarily relieve obstructive defecation, but can be challenging when performed by tactile sense alone. We compared results of BoTox injections with and without ultrasound (US) guidance.\n\nWe retrospectively reviewed BoTox injections into the IAS for obstructive defecation over 5years. Analyzed outcomes included short-term improvement, defined as resolution of enterocolitis, new ability to spontaneously defecate, and/or normalization of bowel movement frequency 2weeks post-operatively, as well as requirement of more definitive surgical therapy (myotomy/myomectomy, colectomy, colostomy, cecostomy/appendicostomy, and/or sacral nerve stimulator implantation). Outcomes were compared using t-test and Fisher\"s Exact test, with significance defined as p<0.05.\n\nTwelve patients who underwent BoTox injection were included, including 5 patients who underwent injections both with and without ultrasound. Ten underwent an ultrasound-guided injection (13 injection procedures), 5 of whom had HD. Seven underwent an injection without ultrasound guidance (17 injection procedures), 5 of whom had HD. Procedures performed with US resulted in greater short-term improvement (76% versus 65% without ultrasound) and less requirement of a definitive procedure for obstructive defecation (p<0.05).",
        "Idiopathic testicular/groin pain can be a difficult entity for children, their families, and caregivers. The role of interdisciplinary pain management has previously been demonstrated in treating chronic orchialgia at the present pediatric pain clinic.\n\nTo evaluate the role of interdisciplinary pain management in managing refractory orchialgia. It was hypothesized that children with refractory orchialgia might respond well. Interdisciplinary care was defined as that which crosses two medical disciplines such as a surgical specialty and specialist in analgesia.\n\nPediatric patients were identified who were: \u2265 10 years old; evaluated in the pediatric urology clinic between 2002 and 2012; were diagnosed wtih ICD code 608.9 or had the diagnosis of male genital disorder NOS. Children were included if they presented with orchialgia without an identifiable cause and failed conservative management (rest, scrotal support, Sitz bath, timed voiding, constipation avoidance) including conventional anti-nociceptive analgesics (acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids). Patient electronic medical records were reviewed retrospectively.\n\nTwenty-two children met inclusion criteria. Mean age was 13.7 years (range 10-17). Nearly half (45%) of the children had chronic medical conditions such as asthma, allergies, and obesity. Twenty-one of the 22 children were referred to the pediatric pain clinic; 15 were evaluated, and one refused treatment. All children evaluated in the pediatric pain clinic were initially offered an empiric anti-neuropathic anti-convulsant (i.e. gabapentin) and/or an anti-depressant (i.e. amitriptyline) before being offered a nerve block. Of the 14 children accepting treatment in the pediatric pain clinic, six were treated solely with an empiric anti-neuropathic anti-convulsant and/or anti-depressant; eight received medications followed by nerve block (seven ilioinguinal-iliohypogastric blocks, one spinal and ilioinguinal-iliohypogastric block) (see Fig. 1). A total of eight of the 14 children (57%) treated by the pain clinic had resolution of pain, with 50% of those treated with medications alone (three out of six children) responding (two responding to gabapentin and a tricyclic antidepressant, one to gabapentin alone); and five out of eight (63%) treated with medications and then nerve block (ilioinguinal-iliohypogastric block) responding. Of the eight children undergoing nerve block, five required more than one block. The time between each block ranged from 4 to 22.6 weeks. Response to nerve block required an average of 1.4 procedures (range 1-2); mean follow-up after nerve block was 2.4 months (range 0.1-4.8).",
        "Human milk provides a multitude of glycoproteins, including highly glycosylated \u03b1-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP), which elicits anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. The milk AGP glycoforms may provide the breastfed infant with a wide range of biological benefits. Here, we analyzed the reactivity of O-linked sugar-specific lectins with human milk AGP over the process of lactation and compared the results with those of the lactating mother\"s plasma.\n\nRelative amounts of human skim milk AGP O-glycans were analyzed in early colostrum, colostrum, and transitional and mature milk samples of 127 healthy mothers by lectin-AGP enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using sialyl T (sialyl-\u03b12,3/\u03b12,6 Gal\u03b21,3GalNAc-), asialyl T (Gal\u03b21,3GalNAc-), and Tn (GalNAc-) antigen-specific biotinylated Artocarpus integrifolia (Jacalin), Arachis hypogaea (PNA), and Vicia villosa (VVA) lectins, respectively.\n\nMilk AGP elicited high expression of Jacalin- and PNA-reactive glycotopes and low expression of VVA-reactive glycotopes, which were absent on plasma AGP of lactating mothers and healthy individuals. The expression of sialyl, asialyl T, and Tn glycotopes of human milk AGP was lactation stage related. The relative amount of Jacalin-reactive AGP glycotope was highest in the colostrum samples and then decreased starting from Day 8 of lactation. In contrast, an increase of the relative amount of PNA-reactive glycotope with milk maturation was observed. The relative amount of VVA-reactive glycotope remained almost constant over the development of lactation.",
        "Although 2% to 4% of the population develop gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) annually, factors associated with the onset of GERD are scarcely known.\n\nTo assess whether such factors include weight gain and psychological distress.\n\nTwo cohorts (first: N=222; second N=754) drawn from 2 case-control studies were followed up for around 5 years. In 2004, all participants were directly interviewed using a validated questionnaire to collect data on body weight, height, GERD symptoms, and psychological distress. In 2009 to 2010, these same participants were again interviewed using the same methodology.\n\nThe response rate was 83.3% in cohort 1 and 39.1% in cohort 2, after a follow-up of 4.3\u00b10.7 and 5.6\u00b10.3 years, respectively. The multivariate analysis showed only weight gain and psychological distress as being independently associated with the onset of GERD in both cohorts. Weight gain per kilogram showed an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 1.21 (1.01-1.44) in the first cohort, and a gain of 5 kg or more showed an adjusted OR of 4.65 (1.72-12.53) in the second. Somatization scores showed an adjusted OR of 1.09 (1.04-1.15) in the first cohort (measured as Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory 2 hypochondriasis score) and 2.88 (1.04-8.02) in the second (measured as psychosomatic symptoms score). Body mass index on attaining overweight or obese status was associated with the onset of GERD in the unadjusted but not in the adjusted analysis.",
        "Corticobasal syndrome (CBS) is a clinical entity characterized by higher cortical dysfunctions associated with asymmetric onset of levodopa-resistant parkinsonism, dystonia and myoclonus. One of the most typical and distressful features of CBS is limb apraxia, which affects patients in their everyday life. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive procedure of cortical stimulation, which represents a promising tool for cognitive enhancement and neurorehabilitation. The present study investigated whether anodal tDCS over the parietal cortex (PARC), would improve ideomotor upper limb apraxia in CBS patients.\n\nFourteen patients with possible CBS and upper limb apraxia were enrolled. Each patient underwent two sessions of anodal tDCS (left and right PARC) and one session of placebo tDCS. Ideomotor upper limb apraxia was assessed using the De Renzi ideomotor apraxia test that is performed only on imitation.\n\nA significant improvement of the De Renzi ideomotor apraxia test scores (post-stimulation versus pre-stimulation) after active anodal stimulation over the left PARC was observed (\u03c7(2) = 17.6, P = 0.0005), whilst no significant effect was noticed after active anodal stimulation over the right PARC (\u03c7(2) = 7.2, P = 0.07). A post hoc analysis revealed a selective improvement in the De Renzi ideomotor apraxia score after active anodal stimulation over the left PARC compared with placebo stimulation considering both right (P = 0.03) and left upper limbs (P = 0.01).",
        "The therapeutic benefit of physical activity to prevent and treat type 2 diabetes is commonly accepted. However, the impact of the disease on the acute metabolic response is less clear. To this end, we investigated the effect of type 2 diabetes on exercise-induced plasma metabolite changes and the muscular transcriptional response using a complementary metabolomics/transcriptomics approach.\n\nWe analysed 139 plasma metabolites and hormones at nine time points, and whole genome expression in skeletal muscle at three time points, during a 60 min bicycle ergometer exercise and a 180 min recovery phase in type 2 diabetic patients and healthy controls matched for age, percentage body fat and maximal oxygen consumption (VO2).\n\nPathway analysis of differentially regulated genes upon exercise revealed upregulation of regulators of GLUT4 (SLC2A4RG, FLOT1, EXOC7, RAB13, RABGAP1 and CBLB), glycolysis (HK2, PFKFB1, PFKFB3, PFKM, FBP2 and LDHA) and insulin signal mediators in diabetic participants compared with controls. Notably, diabetic participants had normalised rates of lactate and insulin levels, and of glucose appearance and disappearance, after exercise. They also showed an exercise-induced compensatory regulation of genes involved in biosynthesis and metabolism of amino acids (PSPH, GATM, NOS1 and GLDC), which responded to differences in the amino acid profile (consistently lower plasma levels of glycine, cysteine and arginine). Markers of fat oxidation (acylcarnitines) and lipolysis (glycerol) did not indicate impaired metabolic flexibility during exercise in diabetic participants.",
        "During pregnancy, adipose tissue (AT) must expand to support the growing fetus and the future nutritional needs of the offspring. Limited expandability of AT is associated with insulin resistance, attributed to ectopic lipid deposition. This study aimed to investigate human AT expandability during pregnancy and its role in the pathogenesis of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).\n\nThis cross-sectional study of omental (OM) and subcutaneous (SQ) AT collected at Caesarean delivery included 11 pregnant and three non-pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance (NGT), five with GDM, three with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Adipocyte size, capillary density, collagen content and capillary growth were measured. Affymetrix arrays and real-time PCR studies of gene expression were performed.\n\nMean OM adipocyte size was greater in women with GDM than in those with NGT (p\\u2009=\\u20090.004). Mean OM and SQ capillary density was lower in GDM compared with NGT (p\\u2009=\\u20090.015). Capillary growth did not differ significantly between groups. The most differentially expressed AT transcript when comparing non-pregnant and pregnant women corresponded to the IGF binding protein (IGFBP)-5, the expression levels of which was found by subsequent quantitative real-time PCR to be lower in women with GDM vs women with NGT (p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001).",
        "Myeloperoxidase (MPO), a highly oxidative enzyme secreted by leukocytes has been implicated in human and experimental nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we investigated how MPO contributes to progression from steatosis to NASH.\n\nIn C57Bl/6J mice fed a diet deficient in methionine and choline to induce NASH, neutrophils and to a lesser extent inflammatory monocytes are markedly increased compared with sham mice and secrete abundant amounts of MPO. Through generation of HOCl, MPO directly causes hepatocyte death in vivo. In vitro experiments demonstrate mitochondrial permeability transition pore induction via activation of SAPK/JNK and PARP. MPO also contributes to activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), the most important source of collagen in the liver. In vitro MPO-activated HSCs have an activation signature (MAPK and PI3K-AKT phosphorylation) and upregulate COL1A1, \u03b1-SMA, and CXCL1. MPO-derived oxidative stress also activates transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) in vitro, and TGF-\u03b2 signaling inhibition with SB-431542 decreased steatosis and fibrosis in vivo. Conversely, congenital absence of MPO results in reduced hepatocyte injury, decreased levels of TGF-\u03b2, fewer activated HSCs, and less severe fibrosis in vivo.",
        "Overweight/obesity has been implicated to play a role in cognitive deficits in bipolar disorder (BD). This study aims to identify the relationship between body fat distribution and different domains of cognition in BD during euthymia.\n\nA sample of 100 euthymic individuals with BD was measured with a cognitive test battery (i.e., Trail Making Test-A-B/TM-A/B, d2 Test of Attention, Stroop test, California Verbal Learning Test/CVLT) and an anthropometric measures set (body mass index, waist circumference, hip circumference, waist-to-hip-ratio, waist-to-height-ratio, and lipometry). Patient data were compared with a healthy control group (n = 64).\n\nResults show that overweight patients with BD exhibit lower performance in the TMT-A/B as well as in the free recall performance of the CVLT compared to normal-weight patients with BD and controls. In bipolar individuals, (abdominal) obesity was significantly associated with a poor cognitive performance. In bipolar females, associations with measures of verbal learning and memory were found; in bipolar males, associations with poor performance in the TMT-A/B and in the Stroop interference task were demonstrated. In controls, no associations were found.",
        "Glucose metabolic activity measured by [(18)F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) has shown prognostic value in multiple malignancies, but results are often confounded by the inclusion of patients with various disease stages and undergoing various therapies. This study was designed to evaluate the prognostic value of tumor FDG uptake quantified by maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) in a large group of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) using consistent treatment techniques.\n\nTwo hundred nineteen lesions in 211 patients treated with definitive SBRT for stage I NSCLC were analyzed after a median follow-up of 25.2 months. Cox regression was used to determine associations between SUVmax and overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and freedom from local recurrence (FFLR) or distant metastasis (FFDM).\n\nSUVmax >3.0 was associated with worse OS (p<0.001), FFLR (p=0.003) and FFDM (p=0.003). On multivariate analysis, OS was associated with SUVmax (HR 1.89, p=0.03), gross tumor volume (GTV) (HR 1.94, p=0.005) and Karnofsky performance status (KPS) (HR 0.51, p=0.008). DSS was associated only with SUVmax (HR 2.58, p=0.04). Both LR (HR 11.47, p=0.02) and DM (HR 3.75, p=0.006) were also associated with higher SUVmax.",
        "Epidemiological data suggests a close link between metabolic syndrome (MetS) and non-metastatic colorectal cancer (NMCRC). However, the relationship between MetS and the outcome of NMCRC is less well understood. We aim to evaluate the impact of MetS on the prognosis in NMCRC patients.\n\nWe performed a large cohort study of 1069 NMCRC patients. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate the cumulative survival rate. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to analyze the prognosis associated with MetS adjusting for clinicopathologic variables.\n\nMetS was identified in 20.7% of NMCRC patients. Patients with MetS were more likely to be older, higher levels of blood glucose, triglycerides, high density lipoprotein, and uric acid than patients without MS (P < 0.05 for all). During a mean period of 59.6 months follow-up, patients with MetS had a statistically significantly lower rate of disease-free survival (DFS) than the patients without MetS (P = 0.014), especially local recurrence (P = 0.040). However, there was no difference in overall survival (P = 0.116). Multivariate analysis showed that the presence of MetS was an independent risk factor for DFS (HR = 0.733, 95%CI 0.545-0.987, P = 0.041), but not for OS (P = 0.118).",
        "Genotypes of hepatitis C virus (HCV) are distributed differently across the world. There is a paucity of such data in a multi-ethnic Asian population like Malaysia. The objectives of this study were to determine the distribution of HCV genotypes between major ethnic groups and to ascertain their association with basic demographic variables like age and gender.\n\nThis was a cross-sectional prospective study conducted from September 2007 to September 2013. Consecutive patients who were detected to have anti-HCV antibodies in the University of Malaya Medical Centre were included and tested for the presence of HCV RNA using Roche Cobas Amplicor Analyzer and HCV genotype using Roche single Linear Array HCV Genotyping strip.\n\nFive hundred and ninety-six subjects were found to have positive anti-HCV antibodies during this period of time. However, only 396 (66.4%) were HCV RNA positive and included in the final analysis. Our results showed that HCV genotype 3 was the predominant genotype with overall frequency of 61.9% followed by genotypes 1 (35.9%), 2 (1.8%) and 6 (0.5%). There was a slightly higher prevalence of HCV genotype 3 among the Malays when compared to the Chinese (P=0.043). No other statistical significant differences were observed in the distribution of HCV genotypes among the major ethnic groups. There was also no association between the predominant genotypes and basic demographic variables.",
        "Psoriasis is a systemic immune-mediated chronic inflammatory disease. In the skin, the antimicrobial proteins koebnerisin (S100A15) and psoriasin (S100A7) are overexpressed in the epidermis of psoriatic lesions and mediate inflammation as chemoattractants for immune cells. Their role for systemic inflammation in circulating leukocytes is unknown.\n\nThe aim of the study was to identify circulating leukocyte populations as a source of koebnerisin and psoriasin. Further, immune-stimulatory effects of these S100A proteins on circulating leukocytes were evaluated and their role as therapeutic response markers in patients with psoriasis was analyzed upon UVB treatment.\n\nThe expression and production of koebnerisin and psoriasin by leukocytes were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunoblotting. The S100A protein mediated regulation of proinflammatory cytokines by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was measured with qRT-PCR and cytometric bead assay.\n\nWe identified circulating leukocytes as novel sources of koebnerisin (S100A15) and psoriasin (S100A7). Circulating leukocytes (PBMCs) of patients with psoriasis produced increased levels of koebnerisin and psoriasin compared to healthy individuals. Both S100A proteins further acted as \"alarmins\" on PBMC to induce proinflammatory cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, such as IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-8. Koebnerisin levels were suppressed in PBMC of psoriatic patients when effectively treated with narrow-band UVB.",
        "Recently, we showed that outdoor air pollution exposure from traffic and industry is associated with an increased risk of skin aging in Caucasian women. In China, indoor air pollution exposure caused by the use of solid fuels like coal is a major health problem and might also increase the risk of skin aging in Chinese women.\n\nAs cooking with solid fuels is a major source of indoor air pollution exposure in China, we aimed to test if cooking with solid fuels is associated with more pronounced skin aging in Chinese women.\n\nWe conducted two cross-sectional studies in China to assess the association between cooking with solid fuels and signs of skin aging. In Pingding (in northern China) we assessed N=405 and in Taizhou (in southern China) N=857 women between 30 and 90 years of age. Skin aging was evaluated by the SCINEXA score. Indoor air pollution exposure, sun exposure, smoking and other confounders were assessed by questionnaires. Associations were then tested by linear and logistic regression analyses adjusted for further confounders.\n\nThe analysis showed that cooking with solid fuels was significantly associated with a 5-8% more severe wrinkle appearance on face and an 74% increased risk of having fine wrinkles on back of hands in both studies combined, independent of age and other influences on skin aging.",
        "In assessing Crohn\"s disease (CD) activity, C-reactive protein (CRP) is an important indicator of inflammation; however, it is not necessarily associated with the Crohn\"s Disease Activity Index (CDAI), particularly in patients with low CRP. Recently, platelet activation factors have been recognized due to their importance in the inflammatory response. In this study, we examined associations between the CDAI and platelet factor 4 (PF-4), \u03b2-thromboglobulin (\u03b2-TG), and other coagulation and fibrinolysis factors.\n\nWe aimed to find a new marker for evaluating disease activity in patients with CD and low CRP.\n\nNine markers, including CRP, platelet count, white blood cell count, fibrin and fibrinogen degradation product, fibrinogen, thrombin-antithrombin complex, prothrombin fragments 1 + 2, PF-4, and \u03b2-TG were evaluated in 47 patients with CD and low CRP (<1.0 mg/dl). Patients were assigned to high or low disease activity groups, CDAI-H (CDAI \u2265 150) and CDAI-L (CDAI < 150), respectively.\n\nCDAI-H exhibited significantly higher PF-4 and \u03b2-TG levels than CDAI-L (P < 0.01). Other markers were not significantly different between groups. CDAI was positively correlated with the levels of PF-4 and \u03b2-TG (P = 0.0033 and 0.0024; r = 0.4202 and 0.4321, respectively). Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses of PF-4 and \u03b2-TG showed high sensitivity (61.9 and 81%, respectively) and specificity (84.7 and 69.2%, respectively) for diagnosing active CD.",
        "The aim of this study was to evaluate the contribution to hyaline cartilage regeneration of dexamethasone intraarticular administration after autologous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) implantation into a preestablished knee full-thickness chondral defect.\n\nFull-thickness chondral defects of 4.5 \u00d7 4.5 mm(2) were surgically made in both medial femoral condyles of adult male New Zealand rabbits. Two weeks later, autologous ex vivo expanded bone marrow-derived MSCs were embedded in hyaluronic acid and implanted into the chondral defects. Immediately and every week after the intervention, dexamethasone 0.25 mg/kg was intraarticularly administered (MSC/dexa-treated group). Six weeks after MSC transplantation, the animals were euthanized and condyles were characterized molecularly according to aggrecan, collagen type II, and collagen type I gene expression (quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction) and histologically (hematoxylin-eosin staining). Data of MSC/dexa-treated condyles were compared with untreated, dexa-treated, MSC-treated, or normal unlesioned condyles.\n\nThe ratio between collagen type II expression versus collagen type I expression in MSC/dexa-treated condyles was higher than one, even though the group mean value was not statistically different from that of untreated defects. Histological changes were observed between MSC/dexa-treated and untreated defects mainly in surface regularity and in hyaline matrix abundance. However, International Cartilage Repair Society score analysis did not support robust differences between those groups.",
        "There is marked variability in weight loss achieved after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) with little ability to predict pre-operatively poor weight-loss outcomes. In this study, we categorize the patterns of post-operative weight loss after LRYGB by using a novel method of measurement based on the time to weight-loss steady state (SS).\n\nA bariatric database was retrospectively reviewed for patients who underwent a LRYGB from 01/2001-12/2010. SS was defined as the month when the patient had \u22643% excess weight loss (%EWL) or weight gain from the prior visit. Percent total weight loss (%TWL) and %EWL were compared based on time to SS.\n\nThe average time to SS was 15.5 months (n\\u2009=\\u2009178). A percentage of 7.3 of patients lost >5%EWL after achieving their SS weight. Patients with SS <12 months (n\\u2009=\\u200947) had a significantly lower %TWL and %EWL at SS and a 3-4-year follow-up compared to SS \u226512 months (n\\u2009=\\u2009131, p\\u2009<\\u20090.05 for all).

        "To study the effect of flavonoids isolated from aerial parts of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi (SSF) on cerebral damage induced by okadaic acid (OA) in rats.\n\nOA was microinjected into the right lateral ventricle of male rats at a dose of 200 ng kg(-1) twice with a 3-day interval between injections to establish a model of Alzheimer\"s-disease-like cerebral damage. Neuronal morphology was observed with thionin staining and the expressions of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and \u03b2-amyloid peptide 1-40 (A\u03b21-40) were monitored via immunohistochemistry. The level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and the activities of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were measured using spectrophotometry.\n\nThe results showed that OA-treated rats exhibited marked neuronal damage accompanied by increased levels of A\u03b21-40 peptide and MDA accumulation, decreased GFAP protein expression and reduced GSH-Px and LDH activity in the brain. SSF at three doses (25, 50 and 100 mg kg(-1)) dramatically reversed the OA-induced changes in the brains of rats.",
        "This study was designed to evaluate vitamin D status with separate determination of 25-OH D2 and 25-OH D3 and its relationship to vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and long-term haemodialysis patients (HD).\n\n45 CKD patients, 103 HD patients, and 25 controls (C) were included. Plasma vitamin D concentrations were determined using chromatography and VDBP in serum and urine in CKD using enzyme immunoassay.\n\nPlasma vitamin D levels were lower in CKD (30.16\\u2009\u00b1\\u200916.74\\u2009ng/mL) and HD (18.85\\u2009\u00b1\\u200915.85\\u2009ng/mL) versus C (48.72\\u2009\u00b1\\u200918.35\\u2009ng/mL), P < 0.0001. 25-OH D3 was the dominant form of vitamin D.

Urinary concentration of VDBP in CKD (0.25\\u2009\u00b1\\u20090.13\\u2009ug/mL) correlated with proteinuria (r = 0.43, P = 0.003).",
        "We evaluated the effect of parathyroid hormone (PTH) on Wnt10b production by immune system cells in humans. We showed that bone anabolic effect of intermittent PTH treatment may be amplified by T cells through increased production of Wnt10b. Chronic increase in PTH as in primary hyperparathyroidism does not increase Wnt10b expression.\n\nThe aim of this study is to assess the effect of PTH on Wnt10b production by immune system cells in humans. We assessed both the effect of intermittent PTH administration (iPTH) and of chronic PTH hypersecretion in primary hyperparathyroidism (PHP).\n\nEighty-two women affected by post-menopausal osteoporosis were randomly assigned to treatment with calcium and vitamin D alone (22) or plus 1-84 PTH (42), or intravenous ibandronate (18). Wnt10b production by unfractioned blood nucleated cells and by T, B cells and monocytes was assessed by real-time RT-PCR and ELISA at baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months of treatment. The effect of chronic elevation of PTH was evaluated in 20 patients affected by PHP at diagnosis and after surgical removal of parathyroid adenoma. WNT10b from both osteoporotic and PHP patients was compared to healthy subjects matched for age and sex.\n\niPTH increases Wnt10b production by T cells, whereas PHP does not. After surgical restoration of normal parathyroid function, WNT10b decreases, although it is still comparable with healthy subjects\" level. Thus, chronic elevation of PTH does not significantly increase WNT10b production as respect to control.",
        "Blood cultures (BCs) are commonly performed on children admitted to hospital for skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). In recent years, this practice has been questioned in patients with uncomplicated SSTIs because of its low yield. At the same time, however, an increase in community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) infections has been described; its influence on rates of bacteremia in patients with SSTIs is unclear. The aims of the study were to describe the performance and the yield of BC in immunocompetent patients with uncomplicated SSTIs and to determine the prevalence of CA-MRSA as a causative agent in our area.\n\nRetrospective study: immunocompetent patients younger than 18 years evaluated in the emergency department and admitted for uncomplicated SSTIs (cellulitis, abscess, impetigo or erysipelas) from July 1, 2010 to June 31, 2014 were included. Patients referred from other hospitals who were receiving parenteral antibiotics and patients with complicated SSTIs (surgical or traumatic wound infection, need for surgical intervention and infected ulcers or burns) were excluded.\n\nWe included 445 cases: 348 (78.2%) cellulitis, 78 (17.5%) abscess and 19 (4.3%) impetigo. BCs were performed on 353 (79.3%) patients. Two (0.6%; 95% confidence interval: 0.2-2.0%) were positive and 10 (2.8%; 95% confidence interval: 1.5-5.1%) contaminated. The positive BCs grew S. aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Wound cultures were performed on 148 (33.3%) patients; 98 (66.2%) were positive. In 22 (22.4%) patients CA-MRSA grew, accounting for 14.9% of overall wound cultures.",
        "Abnormal iron metabolism and hepatic iron-overload is a major cause of liver injury and in the development of chronic liver diseases. Iron-overload-mediated liver disease leads to end-stage cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\nUsing a genetic hemochromatosis (hemojuvelin knockout mice) and non-genetic (secondary iron-overload) murine models of hepatic iron-overload, we elucidated the mechanism of hepatic iron injury and the therapeutic effects of resveratrol.\n\nHepatic iron-overload was associated with hepatosplenomegaly, increased oxidative stress, hepatic fibrosis, and inflammation, and a pro-apoptotic state which was markedly corrected by resveratrol therapy. Importantly our aging studies with the hemojuvelin knockout mice showed advanced liver disease in association with steatosis in the absence of a diabetic state which recapitulates the essential pathological features seen in clinical iron-overload. Chronic hepatic iron-overload showed increased nuclear localization of acetylated Forkhead fox-O-1 (FoxO1) transcription factor whereas resveratrol dietary intervention reversed the acetylation of FoxO1 in association with increased SIRT1 levels which together with its pleotropic antioxidant properties are likely key mechanisms of its therapeutic action. Importantly, resveratrol treatment did not affect the degree of hepatic iron-overload but rather direct protects the liver from iron-mediated injury.",
        "Post-transcriptional RNA regulons ensure coordinated expression of monocistronic mRNAs encoding functionally related proteins. In this study, we employ a combination of RIP-seq and short- and long-wave individual-nucleotide resolution crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) technologies in Drosophila cells to identify transcripts associated with cytoplasmic ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) containing the RNA-binding protein Imp.\n\nWe find extensive binding of Imp to 3\" UTRs of transcripts that are involved in F-actin formation. A common denominator of the RNA-protein interface is the presence of multiple motifs with a central UA-rich element flanked by CA-rich elements. Experiments in single cells and intact flies reveal compromised actin cytoskeletal dynamics associated with low Imp levels. The former shows reduced F-actin formation and the latter exhibits abnormal neuronal patterning. This demonstrates a physiological significance of the defined RNA regulon.",
        "HFE, a major regulator of iron (Fe) homeostasis, has been suggested to be under positive selection in both European and Asian populations. While the genetic variant under selection in Europeans (a non-synonymous mutation, C282Y) has been relatively well-studied, the adaptive variant in Asians and its functional consequences are still unknown. Identifying the adaptive HFE variants in Asians will not only elucidate the evolutionary history and the genetic basis of population difference in Fe status, but also assist the future practice of genome-informed dietary recommendation.\n\nUsing data from the International HapMap Project, we confirmed the signatures of positive selection on HFE in Asian populations and identified a candidate adaptive haplotype that is common in Asians (52.35-54.71%) but rare in Europeans (5.98%) and Africans (4.35%). The T allele at tag SNP rs9366637 (C/T) captured 95.8% of this Asian-common haplotype. A significantly reduced HFE expression was observed in individuals carrying T/T at rs9366637 compared to C/C and C/T, indicating a possible role of gene regulation in adaptation. We recruited 57 women of Asian descent and measured Fe absorption using stable isotopes in those homozygous at rs9366637. We observed a 22% higher absorption in women homozygous for the Asian-common haplotype (T/T) compared to the control genotype (C/C). Additionally, compared with a group of age-matched Caucasian women, Asian women exhibited significantly elevated Fe absorption.",
        "Pulmonary outflow tract obstruction (POTO) reduces systemic atrioventricular valve (SAVV) regurgitation severity in congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries (ccTGA). Therefore, pulmonary artery banding is proposed as a palliative intervention. We aimed to investigate the effect of native or surgically induced POTO on event-free survival, defined as the composite of all-cause mortality, heart transplantation, or congestive heart failure (CHF).\n\nPatients with ccTGA (n=62; median age 27.5 (IQR 18.4-39.4) years; 39% with POTO) were selected from the Adult Congenital Heart Disease database of a tertiary hospital. At first visit, SAVV regurgitation \u2265 3/4, systemic RV dysfunction \u2265 moderate, and CHF were present in 26%, 26%, and 15% of patients, respectively. Over a mean follow-up time of 10.1 \u00b1 6.1 years, all-cause mortality, rate of heart transplantation, and CHF were 18%, 8% and 40%, respectively. SAVV regurgitation (HR: 1.99; 95% CI: 1.01-3.92; P=0.048) and systemic RV dysfunction severity (HR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.05-3.37; P=0.033) were associated with the composite endpoint, independently of age at baseline, POTO, Ebstein-like malformation, and systemic RV dilatation. Patients with POTO had lower risk for developing SAVV regurgitation \u2265 3/4 (HR: 0.18; 95% CI: 0.05-0.58; P=0.004) and moderate systemic RV dysfunction (HR: 0.34; 95% CI: 0.15-0.78; P=0.011).

        "Activated mast cells have been identified in the intima and perivascular tissue of human atherosclerotic plaques. As mast cells have been described to release a number of chemokines that mediate leukocyte fluxes, we propose that activated mast cells may play a pivotal role in leukocyte recruitment during atherosclerotic plaque progression.\n\nSystemic IgE-mediated mast cell activation in apoE(-/-)\u03bcMT mice resulted in an increase in atherosclerotic lesion size as compared to control mice, and interestingly, the number of neutrophils was highly increased in these lesions. In addition, peritoneal mast cell activation led to a massive neutrophil influx into the peritoneal cavity in C57Bl6 mice, whereas neutrophil numbers in mast cell deficient Kit(W(-sh)/W(-sh)) mice were not affected. Within the newly recruited neutrophil population, increased levels of CXCR2(+) and CXCR4(+) neutrophils were observed after mast cell activation. Indeed, mast cells were seen to contain and release CXCL1 and CXCL12, the ligands for CXCR2 and CXCR4. Intriguingly, peritoneal mast cell activation in combination with anti-CXCR2 receptor antagonist resulted in decreased neutrophil recruitment, thus establishing a prominent role for the CXCL1/CXCR2 axis in mast cell-mediated neutrophil recruitment.",
        "Propafenone is a well-known Class Ic antiarrhythmic agent. It has the typical chemical structure of a beta-blocker, but human studies on its beta-blocking effects revealed conflicting results.\n\nTwelve healthy males received single oral doses of 600 mg propafenone and placebo according to a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over protocol. Four hours following drug intake, heart rate and blood pressure were measured, and plasma concentrations of propafenone were determined at rest, during exercise and after recovery. At exercise, propafenone significantly decreased heart rate (-6%, P < 0.05), systolic blood pressure (-6%, P < 0.05), and the rate-pressure product (-11%, P < 0.05). Plasma concentrations of propafenone increased during exercise (+23%, P < 0.05) and decreased during recovery (-33%, P < 0.05).",

From 1995 to 2011, 4930 healthy subjects were examined and followed up until 31 December 2011. All-cause deaths were collected exhaustively. A Cox-based multivariable analysis evaluated long-term total mortality risk according to Dutch Lipid Clinic Network (DLCN) LDL-C concentrations.\n\nAfter a mean follow-up of 8.6 years, 123 all-cause deaths were recorded (cumulative mortality rate, 2.5%). In the final multivariable model, major risk factors such as age, sex, tobacco use and diabetes were significantly associated with mortality. After adjustment for age, sex, tobacco use, hypertension, diabetes and statin therapy, and in comparison with subjects with LDL-C<4 mmol/L (<155 mg/dL), subjects with LDL-C between 4 and <5 mmol/L (155 to <190 mg/dL) had a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.99 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.31-3.02; P=0.001), subjects with LDL-C between 5 and <6.5 mmol/L (190 to <250 mg/dL) had an HR of 1.81 (95% CI, 1.06-3.02; P=0.030), subjects with LDL-C between 6.5 and<8.5 mmol/L (250 to <330 mg/dL) had an HR of 2.69 (95% CI, 1.06-6.88; P=0.038) and subjects with LDL-C \u2265 8.5 mmol/L (\u2265330 mg/dL) had an HR of 6.27 (95% CI, 0.84-46.57; P=0.073).

Specific inhibitors of TRPA1 (HC- 030031) and a specific activator of TRPV1 (capsaicin) were used to block or activate TRPA1 and TRPV1, respectively. Statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.\n\nTRPM8 mRNA was not expressed in primary human monocytes, whereas TRPA1 and TRPV1 were expressed. TRPV1 mRNA expression was suppressed at 32\u00b0C but not at 39\u00b0C. TRPA1 was induced strongly at 32\u00b0C and 39\u00b0C. Immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed that monocytes express TRPA1 and TRPV1 on their cell surface. Interleukin-10 secretion was increased by blocking TRPA1 (77.8\\xa0\u00b1\\xa03 2.8 pg/mL) and activating TRPA1 (79.4\\xa0\u00b1\\xa016.1 pg/mL) after 24\\xa0hours at 32\u00b0C (control 37.4\\xa0\u00b1\\xa017.1 pg/mL, P\\xa0<\\xa0.05). At 36\\xa0hours, tumor necrosis factor secretion was decreased after TRPA1 blockade (2,321\\xa0\u00b1\\xa0439 pg/mL) and TRPV1 activation (2,137\\xa0\u00b1\\xa0411 pg/mL) compared with control (2,567\\xa0\u00b1\\xa0495 pg/mL, P\\xa0<\\xa0.05). Furthermore, miR-155 expression also was suppressed at 24\\xa0hours by TRPA1 blockade and TRPV1 activation (both P\\xa0<\\xa0.05). Silencing of TRPA1 normalized monocyte IL-10 secretion at 32\u00b0C.",
        "Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) improves gas exchange and respiratory mechanics, and it may decrease tissue injury and inflammation. The mechanisms of this protective effect are not fully elucidated. Our aim was to determine the intrinsic effects of moderate and higher levels of PEEP on tidal recruitment/derecruitment, hyperinflation, and lung mechanics, in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\n\nNine patients with ARDS of mainly pulmonary origin were ventilated sequential and randomly using two levels of PEEP: 9 and 15 cmH2 O, and studied with dynamic computed tomography at a fix transversal lung region. Tidal recruitment/derecruitment and hyperinflation were determined as non-aerated tissue and hyperinflated tissue variation between inspiration and expiration, expressed as percentage of total weight. We also assessed the maximal amount of non-aerated and hyperinflated tissue weight.\n\nPEEP 15 cmH2 O was associated with decrease in non-aerated tissue in all the patients (P < 0.01). However, PEEP 15 cmH2 O did not decrease tidal recruitment/derecruitment compared to PEEP 9 cmH2 O (P = 1). In addition, PEEP 15 cmH2 O markedly increased maximal hyperinflation (P < 0.01) and tidal hyperinflation (P < 0.05). Lung compliance decreased with PEEP 15 cmH2 O (P < 0.001).",
        "Cilostazol has been reported to prevent atherosclerotic events in the general population. However, data have been limited whether there are beneficial effects of cilostazol use on long-term clinical outcomes after endovascular therapy in hemodialysis (HD) patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD).\n\nThis study consisted of 595 HD patients undergoing endovascular therapy for a clinical diagnosis of PAD. They were divided into two groups: patients receiving 100mg cilostazol twice daily in conjunction with standard therapy (n=249 patients, cilostazol group) and those not administered cilostazol (n=346 patients, control group). A propensity score analysis was performed to adjust for baseline differences between the two groups. The propensity score-adjusted 10-year event-free survival rate from major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) was significantly higher in the cilostazol group than in the control group [58.6% vs. 43.7%, hazard ratio (HR) 0.57; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41-0.79; p=0.0010]. Notably, the adjusted stroke-free rate was significantly higher in the cilostazol group than in the control group (81.6% vs. 74.7%; HR=0.48; 95% CI, 0.25-0.92, p=0.028). Even after adjusting for other confounders, treatment with cilostazol was an independent predictor for prevention of MACE and stroke (p=0.0028 and p=0.039, respectively).",
        "The purpose of this clinical investigation was to evaluate the effectiveness of a marketed whitening chewing gum compared to a no-gum control in preventing the formation of extrinsic stains on the teeth of stain-forming subjects when chewed over a 12-week period of regular unsupervised use in conjunction with daily tooth brushing.\n\nThis was a single-center, examiner-blind, randomized, 12-week crossover clinical trial. Stain-forming (after smoking or drinking coffee or tea) adults, starting with a stain-free baseline, either chewed the test gum (Orbit White) unsupervised four times per day, 15 minutes/chew, or used no gum along with daily brushing with a commercially available toothbrush and dentifrice for 12 weeks. At the crossover, all procedures were repeated with subjects assigned the opposite treatment. Extrinsic stain was measured at six and 12 weeks by both the Lobene Stain Index (LSI) and the Modified Lobene Stain Index (MLSI) using separate experienced examiners.\n\nAfter 12 weeks, LSI stain scores showed a significant 25% reduction (p = 0.0008) in new stain formation for subjects using the test chewing gum along with tooth brushing versus tooth brushing alone (no-gum control). The corresponding MLSI stain scores demonstrated a 36% reduction (p < 0.0001) in the formation of extrinsic stain on the teeth.",
        "Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the micro-organism of choice for the conversion of fermentable sugars during beverage or bioethanol fermentations. These fermentations are characterised by high osmotic stress on a yeast cell, with selected brewing fermentations beginning at 20-25% fermentable sugars and bioethanol fermentations at 13% fermentable sugars.\n\nRCK2 encodes for a MAPKAP (MAPK-activated protein kinase) enzyme and was identified on a locus by QTL analysis in yeast cells under osmotic stress, RCK2 expression was placed under a tetracycline regulatable vector and rescued glucose, sorbitol or glycerol induced osmotic stress in an rck2 null strain. A strain overexpressing RCK2 had significantly faster fermentation rates when compared with the empty vector control strain.",
        "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in patients with chronic kidney disease. A body of evidence suggests that p-cresyl sulfate (PCS), a uremic toxin, is associated with the cardiovascular mortality rate of patients with chronic kidney disease; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this feature have not yet been fully elucidated.\n\nWe aimed to determine whether PCS accumulation could adversely affect cardiac dysfunction via direct cytotoxicity to cardiomyocytes. In mice that underwent 5/6 nephrectomy, PCS promoted cardiac apoptosis and affected the ratio of left ventricular transmitral early peak flow velocity to left ventricular transmitral late peak flow velocity (the E/A ratio) observed by echocardiography (n=8 in each group). Apocynin, an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase activity, attenuates this alteration of the E/A ratio (n=6 in each group). PCS also exhibited proapoptotic properties in H9c2 cells by upregulating the expression of p22(phox) and p47(phox), NADPH oxidase subunits, and the production of reactive oxygen species. Apocynin and N-acetylcysteine were both able to suppress the effect of PCS, underscoring the importance of NADPH oxidase activation for the mechanism of action.",
        "To investigate the effect of Lycopene (Lyc) on Ang II induced oxidative stress in H9c2 cell line derived from rat cardiac tissue,and to explore related mechanisms.\n\nH9c2 cells were divided into 6 groups: control group, Ang II group (1 \u00b5mol/L), Ang II (1 \u00b5mol/L) + low dose Lyc (3.125 nmol/L) group, Ang II (1 \u00b5mol/L) + moderate dose Lyc (6.25 nmol/L) group and Ang II (1 \u00b5mol/L) + high dose Lyc (12.5 nmol/L) group and Lyc group (12.5 nnmol/L). Cell growth was determined by CCK8 assay, ROS generation was detected using a Microplate reader and Fluorescence microscopy, the expression of NOX2 was determined by Western blot, mRNA expression of p47(phox), SOD1 and SOD2 were determined by Real Time-PCR, MDA was detected by ELISA kit.\n\nCompared to control group,cell survival was significantly reduced and ROS generation was significantly increased post Ang II stimulation,cotreatment with Lyc significantly improved cell survival and reduced ROS generation in a dose-dependent manner (all P < 0.01). mRNA expression of SOD1 and SOD2 was significantly downregulated while MDA concentration was significantly increased in Ang II treated cells, which could be significantly reversed by cotreatment with Lyc in a dose dependent manner (all P < 0.01). Protein expression of NOX2 and mRNA expression of p47(phox) were significantly upregulated post Ang II and which could be significantly downregulated by cotreatment with Lyc in a dose-dependent manner (all P < 0.01).",
        "The prevalence of lung cancer is increasing in the recent decades. The underlying mechanism is unclear. The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and p53 protein are important molecules involving the tumor immunity. This study aims to investigate the role of IGF intervene the radiation-induced lung cancer apoptosis.\n\nLung cancer cells were isolated from surgically removed lung cancer tissue. The lung cancer cell lines, A549 cells and H23 cells were irradiated. The expression of IGF1 receptor (IGF1R) by the lung cancer cells, and apoptosis, were assessed by flow cytometry.\n\nThe results showed that human lung cancer cells expressed IGF1R. IGF1R played a critical role in the radiation-induced lung cancer cell apoptosis. The histone deacetylase-1 (HDAC1) phosphorylation was up regulated by irradiation. The phosphorylated HDAC1 bound the p53 promoter to inhibit the gene transcription, which was abolished by the presence of an inhibitor of HDAC1 or a STAT3 inhibitor.",
        "An increase in the expression of S100A4 has been reported in various inflammatory diseases. However, little is known about the association between periodontal inflammation and S100A4 expression. The aims of this study were to investigate changes in S100A4 expression in human periodontal ligament (hPDL) cells in response to inflammatory stimuli and to describe a possible mechanism underlying the change.\n\nHuman PDL cells were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the level of S100A4 was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting. LPS was added to co-cultures of hPDL and osteoclast progenitor cells under osteoclastogenic condition and the formation of osteoclasts was assessed. Alternatively, progenitor cells were directly treated with recombinant S100A4 for evaluation of osteoclastogenesis. The activity of nuclear factor kappaB (NF\u03baB) was examined by Western blotting for phosphorylated forms of inhibitor kappaB (I\u03baB) and p65. An NF\u03baB inhibitor was added to the culture of hPDL cells with LPS and the level of S100A4 was measured by real-time RT-PCR.\n\nWe found that LPS stimulation resulted in a significant increase of S100A4 expression in hPDL cells. S100A4 protein secretion from hPDL cells was also increased. The enhanced expression of S100A4 in hPDL cells under inflammatory conditions led to stimulation of the generation of osteoclasts. In addition, direct S100A4 treatment stimulated osteoclastogenesis. The underlying mechanism for the increased S100A4 expression in hPDL cells was activation of the NF\u03baB signaling pathway.",
        "Previous studies have demonstrated that fibronectin (FN) levels are increased in brain tissues from patients and animals with epilepsy. This study aimed to assess FN levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum samples from patients with epilepsy.\n\nFibronectin levels were assessed in CSF and serum samples from 56 patients with epilepsy (27 and 29 individuals with intractable epilepsy and nonintractable epilepsy, respectively) and 25 healthy controls, using sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA).\n\nCSF-FN levels were higher in patients with epilepsy (8.07 \u00b1 1.51 mg/l versus 6.20 \u00b1 1.18 mg/l, p<0.05) than in the control group. In addition, serum-FN levels in the group with epilepsy and in the control group were 236.96 \u00b1 65.7 mg/l and 181.43 \u00b1 72.82 mg/l, respectively, indicating a statistically significant difference (p=0.01). Interestingly, serum- and CSF-FN levels in individuals with epilepsy were not affected by antiepileptic drug and duration of epilepsy. Of note, the increase of CSF- and serum-FN levels was more pronounced in subjects with intractable epilepsy than in patients with nonintractable epilepsy.",
        "Increased plasma levels of proteasome have been associated with various neoplasms, especially myeloid malignancies. Little is known of the cellular origin and release mechanisms of such proteasome. We recently identified and characterized a novel particulate cytoplasmic structure (PaCS) showing selective accumulation of ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) components. PaCSs have been reported in some epithelial neoplasms and in two genetic disorders characterized by hematopoietic cell dysplasia and increased risk of leukemia. However, no information is available about PaCSs in hematopoietic neoplasms.\n\nPaCSs were investigated by ultrastructural, immunogold, and immunofluorescence analysis of bone marrow (BM) biopsies and peripheral blood (PB) cell preparations of 33 consecutive, untreated, or relapsed patients affected by different hematopoietic neoplasms. BM and PB samples from individuals with non-neoplastic BM or healthy donors were studied as controls. Granulocytes and platelet proteasome content was measured by immunoblotting and plasma proteasome levels by ELISA.\n\nPaCSs with typical, selective immunoreactivity for polyubiquitinated proteins and proteasome were widespread in granulocytic cells, megakaryocytes, and platelets of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). In acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), PaCSs were only occasionally detected in blast cells and were found consistently in cells showing granulocytic and megakaryocytic maturation. Conversely, PaCSs were poorly represented or absent in non-neoplastic hematopoietic tissue or lymphoid neoplasms. In MPN granulocytes and platelets, the presence of PaCSs was associated with increased amounts of proteasome in cell lysates. PaCSs were often localized in cytoplasmic blebs generating PaCSs-filled plasma membrane vesicles observable in the BM intercellular space. In MPN and MDS, accumulation of PaCSs was associated with significant increase in plasma proteasome. Immunogold analysis showed that PaCSs of myeloid neoplasia selectively concentrated the chaperone proteins Hsp40, Hsp70, and Hsp90.",
        "Insulin resistance is characterized by deficient responses to insulin in its target tissues. In the present study, we examined the effects of L-Citrulline (L-Cit) on insulin sensitivity and signaling cascades in rat hepatoma H4IIE cells and SHRSP.Z-Leprfa/IzmDmcr rats.\n\nH4IIE cells were pretreated in the presence or absence of 250\\xa0\u03bcM\\xa0L-Cit in serum-free medium and then incubated in the presence or absence of 0.1 nM insulin. Rats were allocated into 2 groups; a control group (not treated) and L-Cit group (2\\xa0g/kg/day, L-Cit) and treated for 8\\xa0weeks.\n\nL-Cit enhanced the insulin-induced phosphorylation of Akt in H4IIE cells. Moreover, the inhibited expression of Dex/cAMP-induced PEPCK mRNA by insulin was enhanced by the L-Cit treatment. The phosphorylation of tyrosine, which is upstream of Akt, in insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) was increased by the L-Cit treatment. The L-Cit-induced enhancement in insulin signaling was not related to the binding affinity of insulin to the insulin receptor or to the expression of the insulin receptor, but to a decrease in the phosphorylation of serine 1101 in IRS-1. These results were also confirmed in animal experiments. In the livers of L-Cit-treated rats, PI3K/Akt signaling was improved by decreases in the phosphorylation of serine 1101.",
        "Intra-tumoral genetic and functional heterogeneity correlates with cancer clinical prognoses. However, the mechanisms by which intra-tumoral heterogeneity impacts therapeutic outcome remain poorly understood. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of single tumor cells can provide comprehensive information about gene expression and single-nucleotide variations in individual tumor cells, which may allow for the translation of heterogeneous tumor cell functional responses into customized anti-cancer treatments.\n\nWe isolated 34 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumor cells from a lung adenocarcinoma patient tumor xenograft. Individual tumor cells were subjected to single cell RNA-seq for gene expression profiling and expressed mutation profiling. Fifty tumor-specific single-nucleotide variations, including KRAS(G12D), were observed to be heterogeneous in individual PDX cells. Semi-supervised clustering, based on KRAS(G12D) mutant expression and a risk score representing expression of 69 lung adenocarcinoma-prognostic genes, classified PDX cells into four groups. PDX cells that survived in vitro anti-cancer drug treatment displayed transcriptome signatures consistent with the group characterized by KRAS(G12D) and low risk score.",
        "By producing H2O2, the NADPH oxidase Nox4 is involved in differentiation of mesenchymal cells. Exercise alters the composition of slow and fast twitch fibres in skeletal. Here we hypothesized that Nox4 contributes to exercise-induced adaptation such as changes in muscle metabolism or muscle fibre specification and studied this in wildtype and Nox4-/- mice.\n\nExercise, as induced by voluntary running in a running wheel or forced running on a treadmill induced a switch from fast twitch to intermediate fibres. However the induced muscle fibre switch was similar between Nox4-/- and wildtype mice. The same held true for exercise-induced expression of PGC1\u03b1 or AMPK activation. Both are increased in response to exercise, but with no difference was observed between wildtype and Nox4-/- mice.",
        "Patients requiring anticoagulation suffer from comorbidities such as hypertension. On the occasion of INR monitoring, general practitioners (GPs) have the opportunity to control for blood pressure (BP). We aimed to evaluate the impact of Vitamin-K Antagonist (VKA) monitoring by GPs on BP control in patients with hypertension.\n\nWe cross-sectionally analyzed the database of the Swiss Family Medicine ICPC Research using Electronic Medical Records (FIRE) of 60 general practices in a primary care setting in Switzerland. This database includes 113,335 patients who visited their GP between 2009 and 2013. We identified patients with hypertension based on antihypertensive medication prescribed for \u2265 6 months. We compared patients with VKA for \u2265 3 months and patients without such treatment regarding BP control. We adjusted for age, sex, observation period, number of consultations and comorbidity.\n\nWe identified 4,412 patients with hypertension and blood pressure recordings in the FIRE database. Among these, 569 (12.9%) were on Phenprocoumon (VKA) and 3,843 (87.1%) had no anticoagulation. Mean systolic and diastolic BP was significantly lower in the VKA group (130.6 \u00b1 14.9 vs 139.8 \u00b1 15.8 and 76.6 \u00b1 7.9 vs 81.3 \u00b1 9.3 mm Hg) (p < 0.001 for both). The difference remained after adjusting for possible confounders. Systolic and diastolic BP were significantly lower in the VKA group, reaching a mean difference of -8.4 mm Hg (95% CI -9.8 to -7.0 mm Hg) and -1.5 mm Hg (95% CI -2.3 to -0.7 mm Hg), respectively (p < 0.001 for both).",
        "Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated the limited efficacy of prophylactic drains following hepatic resection. However, many surgeons still insist on using prophylactic drains. This study was designed to identify patients who require prophylactic drains to manage or monitor postoperative complications after hepatic resection.\n\nData were retrospectively collected from 316 patients who underwent hepatic resection and received a prophylactic drain. The patients were divided into two groups according to whether the drain was used to manage or monitor the following postoperative complications: bile leakage (prophylactic drains were used to monitor and treat bile leakage) and postoperative hemorrhage (the drainage fluid was macroscopically bloody and required drain fluid blood counts and monitoring to assess the need for transfusion or reoperation). The results were then validated in a separate cohort of 101 patients.\n\nIn 25/316 patients (7.9 %), the prophylactic drains were clinically effective, being used to manage bile leakage in 18 patients and hemorrhage in 8. Intraoperative bile leakage (P = 0.021) and long operation time (\u2265 360 min) (P = 0.017) were independent predictors of bile leakage. Intraoperative blood loss (\u2265 650 ml) (P = 0.0009) was an independent predictor of hemorrhage. In the subsequent 101 patients, prophylactic drains were clinically effective in patients with one of these predictors with sensitivity, specificity, and false-negative rates of 88.9, 62.0, and 1.7 %, respectively.",
        "To examine the effect of proximal drainage plus lacrimal sac massage in patients with congenital dacryocystoceles.\n\nA retrospective review of 77 patients was performed. Traditional massage was performed in the traditional treatment group (35 patients) first. Proximal lacrimal sac drainage plus massage of the lacrimal sac using a Bangerter lacrimal cannula (defined as modified massage) was performed in the modified group (42 patients). Probing was undertaken if the treatments failed in both groups. Success rates of decompression of lacrimal sac and recovery rate were observed. The \u03c72 test was used to compare the groups.\n\nSuccess rates of decompression of lacrimal sac were 100% in the modified group and 31% in the traditional group. In the modified group, 34 patients with 37 dacryocystoceles (80%) recovered with the modified treatment within 14 days. However, in the traditional group, only 11 patients with 12 dacryocystoceles (30%) had resolution after conservative treatment. The recovery rate of the modified massage in the modified group was higher than that of massage alone in the traditional group (p&lt;0.001). As to the individuals receiving probing, 8 patients with 9\\xa0dacryocystoceles (100%) in the modified group were successful, while 18 patients with 21 dacryocystoceles (78%) in the traditional group had a satisfying effect.",

After stratifying the model by MSAFP level, most of the risk for preterm birth was identified in women with an MSAFP >1 multiple of the median and who had a stable or rising AMH level in early pregnancy.",
        "Our previous work showed that epithelial membrane protein 1 (EMP1) is highly expressed in nucleus pulposus of the human degenerative intervertebral disc. The present study was designed to investigate the role of EMP1 in nucleus pulposus cells in intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD).\n\nHuman nucleus pulposus cells derived from degenerative intervertebral discs were cultured. EMP1 expression was knocked down by lentivirus-mediated specific interfering RNA. Cell morphology was observed, and cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cycle were evaluated.\n\nKnockdown of EMP1 inhibited cell proliferation, caused cells to shrink, and accelerated the apoptosis induced by serum deprivation or addition of cycloheximide but did not evoke apoptosis in normal culture conditions.",
        "Preliminary evidence indicates that the association of fibrinolytic potential, measured as clot lysis time (CLT), with body composition may differ from that of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1). We therefore investigated the association between fibrinolytic markers (plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 activity (PAI-1act) and CLT) and body composition using detailed body composition analyses.\n\nData from 1288 Africans were cross-sectionally analyzed. Body composition analysis included BMI, waist circumference (WC); waist to height ratio (WHtR), skinfolds and body fat percentage measured with air-displacement plethysmography and bioelectrical impedance analysis.\n\nPAI-1act and CLT were significantly higher in women than in men, despite adjustment for differences in body composition. PAI-1act and CLT showed similar linear positive relationships with body composition (BMI, WC, WHtR, skinfolds) in men. In women CLT also showed a linear relationship with body composition, while PAI-1act levels plateaued at higher BMI and did not differ across skinfold categories. PAI-1act showed stronger correlations with body composition markers in men than it did in women, while no sex differences existed for CLT. PAI-1act associated more strongly with central obesity, while CLT associated with total body fat.",
        "Loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in the filaggrin gene (FLG) are a well-replicated risk factor for atopic dermatitis (AD) and are known to cause an epidermal barrier defect. The nature of this barrier defect is not fully understood. Patients with AD with FLG LOF mutations are known to have more persistent disease, more severe disease, and greater risk of food allergies and eczema herpeticum. Abnormalities in corneocyte morphology have been observed in patients with AD, including prominent villus-like projections (VP); however, these ultrastructural features have not been systematically studied in patients with AD in relation to FLG genotype and acute and convalescent status.\n\nWe sought to quantitatively explore the relationship between FLG genotype, filaggrin breakdown products (natural moisturizing factor [NMF]), and corneocyte morphology in patients with AD.\n\nWe studied 15 children at first presentation of AD and after 6 weeks of standard therapy. We applied atomic force microscopy to study corneocyte conformation in patients with AD stratified by FLG status and NMF level. By using a new quantitative methodology, the number of VPs per investigated corneocyte area was assessed and expressed as the Dermal Texture Index score. Corneocytes were also labeled with an anti-corneodesmosin antibody and visualized with scanning electron microscopy.\n\nWe found a strong correlation between NMF levels and Dermal Texture Index scores in both acute and convalescent states (respective r = -0.80 and -0.75, P < .001 and P = .002). Most, but not all, VPs showed the presence of corneodesmosin abundantly all over the cell surface in homozygous/compound heterozygous FLG patients and, to a lesser extent, in heterozygous and wild-type patients.",
        "The cerebral microvasculature is rendered more vulnerable to thrombus formation following a brief (5.0 min) period of focal ischemia. This study examined the contribution of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a neuroprotective and prothrombotic cytokine produced by the brain, to transient ischemia-induced thrombosis in cerebral arterioles.\n\nThe middle cerebral artery of C57BL/6J mice was occluded for 5 min, followed by 24h of reperfusion (MCAo/R). Intravital fluorescence microscopy was used to monitor thrombus development in cerebral arterioles induced by light/dye photoactivation. Thrombosis was quantified as the time of onset of platelet aggregation on the vessel wall and the time for complete blood flow cessation. MCAo/R in wild type (WT) mice yielded an acceleration of thrombus formation that was accompanied by increased IL-6 levels in plasma and in post-ischemic brain tissue. The exaggerated thrombosis response to MCAo/R was blunted in WT mice receiving an IL-6 receptor-blocking antibody and in IL-6 deficient (IL-6(-/-)) mice. Bone marrow chimeras, produced by transplanting IL-6(-/-) marrow into WT recipients, did not exhibit protection against MCAo/R-induced thrombosis.",
        "Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) pathway proteins play an important role in modulating inflammation and other carcinogenic processes.

        "The aim of this study was to assess monocyte Fc receptor (FcR) status and function in patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in relation to healthy controls (HC) and to disease activity.\n\nThe study population comprised 23 patients with active polyarticular PsA and 33 age- and gender-matched HC. Immunoglobulin (Ig) levels, inflammatory laboratory parameters, patient-reported outcomes of joint disease activity, skin scoring (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index, PASI), and joint status were determined in the patients. Monocytes were analysed for the expression of FcRs for IgG (Fc\u03b3R) class I (CD64), IIa (CD32a), IIb (CD32b), and III (CD16), the FcR for IgA (Fc\u03b1R) (CD89), and surface-bound IgG. The monocytic Fc\u03b3R function was assessed by evaluating IgG immune complex (IC) binding and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 production following IgG-IC stimulation. The monocytes were further subdivided and analysed according to their CD14 and CD16 expression.\n\nThe PsA patients presented elevated serum levels of IgG1, 2, and 3 and increased numbers of CD64(+) monocytes. Furthermore, the PsA monocytes exhibited increased cell-bound IgG, and the Fc\u03b3R function was affected in terms of reduced IgG-IC-mediated TNF-\u03b1 release. These findings correlated significantly with different markers of joint disease activity. PsA was also accompanied by an increase in the CD16 low-expressing monocyte subset.",
        "This study aimed to determine whether postoperative morbidity and mortality rates increased after preoperative chemoradiation in patients who underwent gastrectomy.\n\nThe medical records of 7404 patients with gastric or gastroesophageal cancer seen from January 1995 to August 2012 were reviewed to identify patients who underwent gastrectomy. \u03c7 (2) and logistic regression analysis were used to determine differences in the 90-day postoperative morbidity and mortality rates of patients who underwent upfront surgery (SURG), preoperative chemotherapy (CHEMO), or preoperative chemoradiation (CHEMOXRT).\n\nOf the 500 patients included in this study, 200 underwent SURG, 65 had CHEMO, and 235 had CHEMOXRT. Respectively, 33, 43, and 58 % of these patients underwent total gastrectomy (p < 0.01). Resection of other organs was performed respectively in 19, 26, and 23 % of the patients (p = 0.37). Minor complications within 90 days (Clavien-Dindo 1 or 2) occurred for 41 % of the SURG patients, 43 % of the CHEMO patients, and 45 % of the CHEMOXRT patients (p = 0.68). Major complications or death within 90 days (Clavien-Dindo 3, 4, or 5) occurred for 21, 28, and 29 % of the patients, respectively (p = 0.15). The 90-day mortality (Clavien-Dindo 5) rates were 2 % for the SURG patients, 6 % for the CHEMO patients, and 3 % for the CHEMOXRT patients (p = 0.25). The median hospital stays were respectively 12, 12, and 13 days (p = 0.09). In the multivariate analysis, male sex, gastroesophageal junction cancer, total gastrectomy, and resection of other organs were associated with increased major morbidity and mortality rates, whereas preoperative therapy was not.",

        "Differentiation among types of muscular dystrophy (MD) has remained challenging. In this retrospective study, we sought to develop a methodology for differentiation of MD types using analysis of serum enzyme profiles.\n\nThe serum levels of enzymes from 232 patients, including 120 with DMD, 36 with BMD, 36 with FSHD, 46 with LGMD, and 11 with EDMD, were evaluated.\n\nThe characteristic profiles of serum enzymes facilitated differentiation of these five types of MD. DMD was characterized by simultaneous elevation of ALT, AST, LDH, and ALP; BMD and LGMD were characterized by elevation of ALT, AST, and LDH; and FSHD and EDMD were characterized by a lack of abnormal serum enzyme levels. We further developed discriminant functions to distinguish BMD and LGMD. For LGMD, LGMD2B patients had significantly higher ALP levels than non-LGMD2B patients (98 \u00b1 59 U/L versus 45 \u00b1 9 U/L, resp., p < 0.05).",
        "This study was conducted to find out the optimal vitamin D cutoff point in predicting activity of RA disease.\n\nOne hundred and two rheumatoid arthritis Saudi patients of both genders were recruited in this study. Vitamin D as 25-hydroxy-vitamin D [25(OH)D] was measured and serum level less than 20 ng/mL defined as deficient patient. Disease activity was measured based on the disease activity score index of a 28-joint count (DAS28) using serum erythrocyte sedimentation rate levels. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine the optimal vitamin D cutoff points for identifying disease activity.\n\nIt has been observed that vitamin D levels were lower (P < 0.05) in patients with high disease activity. A significant inverse correlation between serum 25(OH)D levels and DAS28 (r = -0.277, P = 0.014) was shown. ROC curves results showed that vitamin D less than 12.3 ng/mL predicted high disease activity, and vitamin D more than 17.9 ng/mL predicted low disease activity, with good sensitivity and accuracy results regarding vitamin D.",
        "Isolation of the pulmonary veins alone (PVI) is associated with a 50 to 70 % success rate in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) but is significantly lower for persistent AF. We sought to evaluate patient outcomes in terms of safety and efficacy when posterior left atrial box isolation is included as a catheter ablation strategy in patients with mainly persistent AF.\n\nWe performed an audit of 100 patients undergoing left atrial (LA) box isolation. Recurrence of arrhythmia was detected by evaluating symptoms and continuous 24 h ECG monitoring at 2, 6 and 12 months post procedure.\n\nSeventy-two patients had persistent AF prior to procedure. Average duration of AF was 5.4 \u00b1 5.2 years. All patients underwent circumferential PVI plus linear posterior LA lines to complete box isolation. At a mean follow-up of 12.5 \u00b1 4.2 months, 75 patients were free from atrial fibrillation, 50.6 % of these were taking no antiarrhythmic medication. Twenty-five patients had recurrence of AF, 84 % of whom had previous persistent AF. The average time to recurrence post procedure was 5.9 \u00b1 4.4 months. Thirteen patients underwent repeat procedures for recurrent AF. There were no adverse events relating to the procedure.",
        "Cytokines secreted by adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) significantly alter adipocyte function, inducing inflammatory responses and decreasing insulin sensitivity. However, little relevant information is available regarding the role of microvesicles (MVs) derived from ATMs in macrophage-adipocyte crosstalk.\n\nMVs were generated by stimulation of M1 or M2 phenotype THP-1 macrophages and incubated with human primary mature adipocytes and differentiated adipocytes. Subsequently, insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt (pAkt) and glucose uptake were determined. Glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) translocation and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B were also analyzed in treated adipocytes.\n\nM1 macrophage-derived MVs (M1 MVs) significantly reduced protein abundance of insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation in human primary mature adipocytes and differentiated adipocytes, when compared with the same concentration of M2 macrophage-derived MVs (M2 MVs). In contrast to M2 MVs, which enhanced the insulin-induced glucose uptake measured by 2-NBDG, M1 MVs decreased this effect in treated adipocytes. M1 MVs treatment also brought about a significant increase in the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B, coupled with a decrease in pAkt level and GLUT4 translocation compared with M2 MVs-treated adipocytes. These effects were reversed by BAY 11-7085, a NF- kappa B specific inhibitor.",
        "Invasive fungal infections have significantly increased over the past decades in immunocompromised individuals and high-risk patients. Amphotericin B (AmB) exerts a powerful and broad activity against a vast array of fungi and has a remarkably low rate of microbial resistance. However, most isolates of Aspergillus terreus developed an intrinsic resistance against AmB, and during this study, we characterized the mode of action of this polyene antifungal drug in more detail in resistant (ATR) and rare susceptible (ATS) clinical isolates of A. terreus.\n\nWe illustrate that AmB treatment changes cellular redox status and promotes the generation of high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in ATS. In contrast, ATR isolates were able to cope better with AmB-induced oxidative stress.\n\nMost importantly, we demonstrate in this study that coapplication of anti- and pro-oxidants significantly affects AmB efficacy in an antithetic manner--antioxidants and ROS-scavenging agents increase AmB tolerance in susceptible strains, while pro-oxidants render formerly resistant isolates considerably susceptible to the antifungal drug also in vivo in a Galleria animal model.",
        "Strong and independent associations between plasma concentration of cystatin C and risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) suggests causal involvement of cystatin C.\n\nThe aim of our study was to assess whether there is a causal relationship between plasma concentration of cystatin C and risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) using a Mendelian Randomization approach.\n\nWe estimated the strength of association of plasma cystatin C on CAD risk and the strength of association of the strongest GWAS derived cystatin C SNP (rs13038305) on plasma cystatin C in the population-based Malm\u00f6 Diet and Cancer Study (MDC) and thereafter the association between rs13038305 and CAD in the MDC (3200 cases of CAD and 24418 controls) and CARDIOGRAM (22233 cases of CAD and 64762 controls).\n\nEach standard deviation (SD) increment of plasma cystatin C was associated with increased risk of CAD (OR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.07-1.34) after full adjustment. Each copy of the major allele of rs13038305 was associated with 0.34 SD higher plasma concentration of cystatin C (P<1 x 10-35), resulting in a power of >98% to detect a significant relationship between rs13038305 and CAD in MDC and CARDIOGRAM pooled. The odds ratio for CAD (per copy of the major rs13038305 allele) was 1.00 (0.94-1.07); P = 0.92 in MDC, 0.99 (0.96-1.03); P = 0.84 in CARDIOGRAM and 1.00 (0.97-1.03); P = 0.83 in MDC and CARDIOGRAM pooled.",
        "Periodontal disease is a chronic inflammatory process that potentially leads to alveolar bone destruction and tooth loss. Tissue engineering combined with stem cell therapy is a potential effective treatment for periodontal bone loss. Amniotic membrane (AM) is a potential scaffold enriched with multiple growth factors. It has the effects of anti-inflammation, antiangiogenesis, and immunosuppression. Herein, we used adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) and an AM co-cultured system to study bone regeneration in a rat periodontal defect model in\\xa0vivo.\n\nHuman ADSCs were isolated from the infrapatellar fat pad, and characterized by flow cytometry, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and multipotent differentiation assays. The co-culture system was applied in the periodontal two-wall osseous defect in a rat model, and computed tomography was used to measure the effect.\n\nHuman ADSCs isolated from the infrapatellar fat pad showed spindle-like morphology. Flow cytometry results demonstrated that ADSCs expressed a high level of CD90 and CD105, but not CD31, CD34, and CD45. ADSCs strongly expressed stemness genes, including SOX2, OCT4, NANOG, and KLF4 on different passages. Furthermore, ADSCs were able to differentiate into osteogenic, chondrogenic, and adipogenic cells. In the periodontal osseous defect rat model, ADSCs and the AM co-culture system significantly increased bone regeneration.",

The program was able to analyze 93% (1141) of these studies. A subset of these requisitions was manually reviewed.\n\nThe software program demonstrated a very low 2.5% inappropriate rate and manual review showed an even lower number of 0.6%. In a sample of studies deemed to be appropriate by the software, manual review agreed with this ranking in all cases. In addition, in 20% of cases where CT was done, the software program suggested that MRI would be a more appropriate choice.",
        "To determine whether the presence of intervertebral bridging ossifications is associated with intravertebral cleft (IVC) formation following a vertebral compression fracture (VCF).\n\nPatients with a VCF who received conservative treatment for a minimum of 3\\xa0months were recruited over a 3-year period. Baseline radiographs obtained within a month of onset were compared between 50 patients who developed an IVC at 3-month follow-up (IVC group) and 100 patients without an IVC (control group). Intervertebral bridging ossification was defined as complete bridging of the intervertebral space by ossification. The presence of bridging ossification was assessed at each intervertebral level from T9/10 to L5/S. In addition to the absolute levels of bridging ossifications, the level relative to a fresh VCF was recorded.\n\nThe incidence of bridging ossification at levels T9/10 and T10/11 was significantly higher in the IVC group than in the control group. IVC group patients showed a significantly higher incidence of bridging ossification at the second proximal intervertebral segment than those in the control group. IVC group patients also had a significantly greater sagittal wedge angle and a greater local kyphosis angle than control group patients.",
        "The aims of this study were to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and to determine the immune factors for treatment success in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) treated with chemotherapy followed by adoptive cell transfer (ACT).\n\nA total of 43 HNSCC patients who received radical resection and chemotherapy were analysed in this study. Twenty-one of the patients were repeatedly treated with ACT after chemotherapy (ACT group), and the other twenty-two patients without ACT treatment were included as part of the control group. To investigate the immunological differences underlying these observations, we expanded and profiled improving cytokine-induced killer cells (iCIK) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with the timed addition of RetroNectin, OKT3 mAb, IFN \u03b3 and IL-2.\n\nThe median of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in the ACT group were significantly higher as compared to the control group (56 vs. 40; 58 vs. 45 months). In iCIK culture, there was a significant reduction in CD3+CD4+ T-cell proliferation and cytokines (IL-2, TNF) production from patients who received chemotherapy compared to patients without chemotherapy. Intra-arterial infusion of iCIK, in coordination with chemotherapy, considerably rescued iCIK culture from the suppression of systemic immunity induced by chemotherapy and induced tumour regression.",
        "Sexually transmitted infections (STI) are common among HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM). While behavioral factors are important in STI acquisition, other biological factors such as immune modulation due to chronic viral infection may further predispose to STI acquisition.\n\nPost Hoc analysis including data collected over 12 months of follow-up from 131 HIV-infected MSM receiving antiretroviral therapy and screened for incident bacterial STI every 3 months.\n\nGenital secretions collected at baseline were used to measure herpesvirus replication and inflammatory cytokines. Baseline predictors of STI were determined using survival analysis of time to incident STI.\n\nAll participants were seropositive for cytomegalovirus (CMV), and 52% had detectable genital CMV at baseline. Thirty-five individuals acquired STI during follow-up, sometimes with multiple pathogen (17 syphilis, 21 gonorrhea, 14 chlamydia). Syphilis acquisition was associated with genital CMV replication at baseline (19.1% CMV-shedders versus 4.8% non-shedders, p=0.03) and younger age (p=0.02). Lower seminal MCP-1 was associated with higher seminal CMV levels and with syphilis acquisition (p<0.01). For syphilis acquisition, in multivariable Cox-Proportional Hazard model adjusted hazard rates were 3.56 (95%CI:1.00-12.73) for baseline CMV replication and 2.50 (0.92-6.77) for younger age.",
        "Exposure of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) to excessive cyclic stretch such as in hypertension causes a shift in their phenotype. The focal adhesion protein zyxin can transduce such biomechanical stimuli to the nucleus of both endothelial cells and VSMCs, albeit with different thresholds and kinetics. However, there is no distinct vascular phenotype in young zyxin-deficient mice, possibly due to functional redundancy among other gene products belonging to the zyxin family. Analyzing zyxin function in VSMCs at the cellular level might thus offer a better mechanistic insight. We aimed to characterize zyxin-dependent changes in gene expression in VSMCs exposed to biomechanical stretch and define the functional role of zyxin in controlling the resultant VSMC phenotype.\n\nDNA microarray analysis was used to identify genes and pathways that were zyxin regulated in static and stretched human umbilical artery-derived and mouse aortic VSMCs. Zyxin-null VSMCs showed a remarkable shift to a growth-promoting, less apoptotic, promigratory and poorly contractile phenotype with \u224890% of the stretch-responsive genes being zyxin dependent. Interestingly, zyxin-null cells already seemed primed for such a synthetic phenotype, with mechanical stretch further accentuating it. This could be accounted for by higher RhoA activity and myocardin-related transcription factor-A mainly localized to the nucleus of zyxin-null VSMCs, and a condensed and localized accumulation of F-actin upon stretch.",

Prolifereation and invasion assays were carried out in vitro. And in vivo tumor burden assay was done in nude mice.\n\nThe expression of EGFL7 was knocked-down by 80% in hep-2 cells transfected by the lentiviral EGFL7 shRNA vector and EGFL7 gene expression was detected by realtime PCR and Western blotting analysis respectively. The flow cytometric analysis showed that arrested the cell cycle in G1 phase, In tumor burden assay, to parental And vector control cells, the survival rates Of nude mice in EGFL7 shRNA group dropped down from the first day after implantation as indicated by MTT assay (P < 0.05).

        "To investigate the inhibitory effect of testosterone on oxidized low-density lipoproteins (ox-LDL)-stimulated phenotypic transition and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in vitro, and explore its possible mechanisms.\n\nRat VSMCs were cultured using serum starvation method to make cell synchronization. Cells in vitro were divided into control group, ox-LDL group (treated with 50 \u03bcg/mL ox-LDL), FBS group (treated with 100 mL/L fetal bovine serum), and testosterone groups (treated respectively with 5\u00d710(-8) and 5\u00d710(-7) mol/L testosterone for 12 hours, followed by incubation with 50 \u03bcg/mL ox-LDL). The effect of testosterone on the ox-LDL-induced proliferation of VSMCs was explored by WST-1 assay. The cell cycle distribution was determined using flow cytometry. Western blotting was used to detect the expressions of mitofusin 2 (Mfn2), phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (p-ERK1/2), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and osteopontin (OPN).\n\nCompared with control group, the proliferation of VSMCs was promoted by ox-LDL, the number of VSMCs decreased in G0/G1 phase and increased in S phase significantly, the expression levels of Mfn2 and \u03b1-SMA were significant reduced, and the expression levels of p-ERK1/2, PCNA and OPN were significant raised in ox-LDL group. Compared with ox-LDL group, testosterone showed stronger inhibitory effect on the proliferation of VSMCs induced by ox-LDL, arrested most of the cells in the G0/G1 phase, ascended significantly the expression levels of Mfn2 and \u03b1-SMA, and descended significantly the expression levels of p-ERK1/2, PCNA and OPN in the two testosterone groups in a slight dose-dependent manner.",

Real-time fluorescent PCR was used to examine the expressions of Notch1 and Foxn4 mRNAs in different concentration IL-23-treated TE-1 cells. After Notch pathway was blocked with \u03b3-secretase inhibitor DAPT, expressions of Notch intracellular domain (NICD), Delta-like 4 (DLL4), hairy enhancer of split 1 (Hes1), matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) in IL-23-treated TE-1 cells were measured by Western blotting. And the migration of IL-23-treated TE-1 cells was studied by TranswellTM migration assay.\n\nCompared with adjacent tissues, IL-23 was highly expressed in ESCC tissues. IL-23 treatment up-regulated significantly the expressions of NICD, DLL4, Hes1 and MMP-9 in TE-1 cells. The blockade of Notch1 pathway inhibited the expressions induced by IL-23. Migration assay revealed that IL-23 treatment significantly enhanced the migration of TE-1 cells.",

The risk of acquiring Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection among peripartum human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected women is poorly defined.\n\nTo determine the incidence of and co-factors for interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) conversion among postpartum HIV-infected women using T-SPOT.TB.\n\nWe used data and cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a historical cohort of HIV-infected women enrolled at 32 weeks\" gestation and followed for 1 year postpartum between 1999 and 2005.\n\nOf 89 women initially IGRA-negative during pregnancy, 11 (12.4%) became positive, 53 (59.5%) remained negative and 25 (28.1%) were indeterminate at 1 year postpartum. Mean interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) response among converters increased from ~1 to >50 spot-forming cells/well (P = 0.015). IGRA conversion was significantly associated with partner HIV infection, flush toilets, maternal illness and cough during follow-up, but not maternal CD4 count or HIV viral load.",
        "The YPEL (Yippee-like) gene family comprises five highly conserved members (YPEL1-5), but their biological function remains largely unknown. Early studies of YPEL1 function suggested that it plays a role in the development of structures derived from the pharyngeal arches. Human YPEL1 localises to distal chromosome 22q11.2 and copy number changes at this locus lead to diverse phenotypes that include facial dysmorphism, facial asymmetry, and palatal anomalies comprising the distal 22q11.2 deletion/duplication syndromes (OMIM 611867). We therefore investigated the role of chick YPEL1 in craniofacial development using ex vivo and in vivo approaches in the avian model.\n\nWe found that retroviral-mediated in vivo overexpression of YPEL1 causes abnormal mandibular morphogenesis associated with increased apoptosis and involvement of the BMP/MSX pathway.",
        "To explore the association between quality of life and social support in elderly osteoporosis patients in a Chinese population.\n\nA total of 214 elderly patients who underwent bone mineral density screening were divided into two groups: elderly patients with primary osteoporosis (case group, n = 112) and normal elderly patients (control group, n = 102). Quality of life and social support were compared between the two groups.\n\nQuality of life and social support were significantly different between the case and control groups. The physical function, role-physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social-functioning, role-emotional and mental health scores in case group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P < 0.01). The objective support, subjective support, utilization of support, and total scores in case group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P < 0.01). Quality of life and social support were positively correlated in the case group (r = 0.672, P < 0.01).",
        "Allergies arise from aberrant Th2 responses to allergens. The processes involved in the genesis of allergic sensitization remain elusive. Some allergens such as derived from house dust mites have proteolytic activity which can induce oxidative stress in vivo. A reduced capacity of the host to control oxidative stress might prime for allergic sensitization.\n\nTwo different strains of mice were compared for their antioxidant and immune response to HDM. Protease activity of the HDM extract was reduced to investigate its role in oxidative stress induction in the airways and whether this induction could determine allergic sensitization and inflammation. The role of oxidative stress in allergic sensitization was also investigated in humans. An occupational cohort of animal workers was followed for the development of sensitization to rodent urinary proteins. Levels of oxidative stress in serum and antioxidant responses by PBMCs were determined.\n\nSusceptibility to allergic sensitization to mite allergens in mice was highly dependent on host genetic background and was associated with oxidative stress in the lungs before allergen exposure and poor antioxidant response after allergen exposure. Reduction in mite protease activity limited its capacity to induce oxidative stress and allergic inflammation in mice. We showed that also in human subjects, oxidative stress before allergen exposure and poor antioxidant responses were associated with predisposition to occupational allergy.",
        "This study examines the relationship between physical activity (PA), sedentary behavior (SB) and body weight in Korean adolescents.\n\nThis study used a nationally representative sample of 72,368 South Korean adolescents, aged 13 to 18 years. The study sample was categorized according to BMI as follows: underweight, body mass index (BMI) <18.5; normal weight, 18.5 \u2264 BMI < 23.0; overweight, 23.0 \u2264 BMI < 25.0; and obese, 25.0 \u2264 BMI. An analysis was then performed to determine if meeting the recommended guidelines for PA frequency (5 times/week \u2264) and amount of SB (<2 hours/day) was associated with weight category.\n\nThe percentage of normal weight adolescents was 54.3% while the percentages of underweight, overweight, and obese adolescents were 27.4%, 10.2%, and 8.1%, respectively. Significantly fewer underweight and obese adolescents met PA guidelines compared to normal weight adolescents.

        "The purpose of this study was to determine the use of Central Epidural Steroid Injections (ESI) and Selective Nerve Root Blocks (SNRB) along with the crossover rate to lumbar discectomy in patients with a lumbar disc herniation using retrospective records database search. Butterman et al found a crossover rate for patients with symptomatic disc herniations treated with ESI of 54% (27/50), while Riew similarly found a 53% (29/55) crossover patients receiving SNRB.\n\nThe database was searched in a sequential Boolean style for patients with the diagnosis of a lumbar disc herniation (Displaced Lumbar Disc - 722.1) and a SNRB (64483) or ESI (62311) who subsequently underwent a Lumbar Discectomy (63030) over a three year time period from January 2004 through December 2006. Statistical analysis was preformed examining the impact of injection type, age, location, gender, and year.\n\nOf 482,893 patients with the diagnosis of a disc herniation, 27,799(5.76%) underwent a lumbar discectomy. The 29,941 patients who received at least one SNRB for a disc herniation, 10.80% later underwent a lumbar discectomy. The 41,420 patients who received at least one ESI for a disc herniation 9.34% later underwent a lumbar discectomy. There was a noted increase in injection procedures, particularly SNRB during the study with a greater than 50% increase.",
        "Despite the demonstrated advantageous systemic changes in response to regular exercise for individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF), exercise is still viewed as an elective rather than a vital component of therapy, and it is likely that these benefits extend to and are partially mediated by exercise-induced changes in ion regulation.\n\nWe sought to determine if exercise could provide comparable improvements in ion regulation in the CF lung as albuterol, measured using exhaled breath condensate (EBC) collection and nasal potential difference (NPD).\n\nFourteen CF (13-42\\xa0yrs.) and sixteen healthy (18-42\\xa0yrs.) subjects completed a randomized crossover study of albuterol and submaximal exercise. EBC was collected at baseline, 30- and 60-min post-albuterol administration, and at baseline and during three separate 15\\xa0min cycling exercise bouts at low, moderate, and vigorous intensity (25, 50 and 65% of the maximum workload, respectively). NPD was performed at 30- and 80-min post albuterol or following moderate and vigorous intensity exercise.\n\nCF subjects had lower EBC Cl(-), but no difference in EBC Na(+) at baseline when compared to healthy subjects. EBC Cl(-) increased four-fold with moderate exercise which was similar to that seen 60-min post albuterol administration for CF subjects. Neither exercise nor albuterol altered EBC Na(+). The change in NPD voltage with amiloride (\u0394Amil) was greater and there was minimal Cl(-) secretion (\u0394TCC) seen at baseline in the CF compared to the healthy subjects. \u0394Amil was greater with both albuterol and exercise when compared to baseline within both CF and healthy groups, but there was no significant difference in the \u0394TCC response with either treatment.",
        "Myocardial infarction (MI) due to sudden occlusion of a major coronary artery leads to a complex series of events that result in left ventricle (LV) impairment eventual heart failure. Therapeutic options are limited to reverse such trends post MI. The aim of this study was to compare the acute cardioprotective effects of the antioxidants, resveratrol (RES) and coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), either individually or in combination, on infracts size, LV hemodynamics, inflammation and oxidative stress markers in rats with experimentally induced MI.\n\nMale Wistar rats were randomly divided into six groups: control without surgery, sham without occlusion, MI without antioxidants, RES pre-treated then MI (20 mg/kg, orally), CoQ10 then MI (20 mg/kg, intramuscular.), and combined RES and CoQ10 then MI with (each group n = 10). Pretreatment commenced 7 days prior to the permanent occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. Infarct area, hemodynamics, inflammation and oxidative stress markers were assessed 24 hours post-MI.\n\nCompared to RES alone, CoQ10 pre-administration either by itself or in combination with RES, significantly reduced LV infarct area (57%), and normalized LV hemodynamic parameters like LVEDP (100%), LVSP (95.4%), LV +dp/dt and -dp/dt (102 and 73.1%, respectively). CoQ10 also decreased serum levels of brain natriuretic peptide (70%), and various circulating inflammatory markers like TNF-\u03b1 (83.2%) and IL-6 (83.2%).

Because of their role in tumorigenesis and stability in body fluids, microRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging as a promising diagnostic tool. Our aim was to identify miRNAs deregulated in breast tumors and evaluate the potential of circulating miRNAs in breast cancer detection.\n\nWe conducted miRNA expression profiling of 1919 human miRNAs in paraffin-embedded tissue from 122 breast tumors and 11 healthy breast tissue samples. Differential expression analysis was performed, and a microarray classifier was generated. The most relevant miRNAs were analyzed in plasma from 26 healthy individuals and 83 patients with breast cancer (36 before and 47 after treatment) and validated in 116 healthy individuals and 114 patients before treatment.\n\nWe identified a large number of miRNAs deregulated in breast cancer and generated a 25-miRNA microarray classifier that discriminated breast tumors with high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. Ten miRNAs were selected for further investigation, of which 4 (miR-505-5p, miR-125b-5p, miR-21-5p, and miR-96-5p) were significantly overexpressed in pretreated patients with breast cancer compared with healthy individuals in 2 different series of plasma. MiR-505-5p and miR-96-5p were the most valuable biomarkers (area under the curve 0.72). Moreover, the expression levels of miR-3656, miR-505-5p, and miR-21-5p were decreased in a group of treated patients.",
        "With each passing year, the number of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is increasing steadily, but there are limited data on the postoperative outcomes of these patients after appendectomy.\n\nUsing the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, we identified all patients who underwent appendectomy in the United States between 1998 and 2010. We used International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification codes to identify patients with ESRD and to track postoperative complications during hospital admission. Statistical models were controlled for age, sex, race, insurance type, number of Elixhauser comorbidities, year of admission, perforation of the appendix, and operative approach.\n\nThe study population included 5,712 patients with ESRD, with the remaining 3,615,391 patients serving as reference controls. Patients with ESRD had risk of death that was nearly 5 times greater than controls (odds ratio [OR] 5.68; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 3.96-8.15; P\\xa0<\\xa0.001); this risk was similar for nonperforated (OR 4.97; P\\xa0<\\xa0.001) and perforated (5.96; P\\xa0=\\xa0.004) appendicitis. The risk of death, however, was greater for open appendectomy (OR 6.65; P\\xa0<\\xa0.001) compared with laparoscopic appendectomy (OR 2.50; P\\xa0=\\xa0.060). Patients with ESRD also were at an increased risk of mechanical wound complication (OR 1.58; P\\xa0=\\xa0.040) and had a mean duration of stay that was 34% greater compared with controls (P\\xa0<\\xa0.001).",
        "Rapid weight gain during infancy increases childhood asthma risk, which might be related to impaired lung function. This study investigated associations between peak weight velocity (PWV) during the first two years of life and spirometric lung function indices at 15 years of age.\n\nData from 1842 children participating in the GINIplus German birth cohort who underwent spirometry at age 15 were analysed. PWV was calculated from weight measurements obtained between birth and two years of age. Generalised additive models were fitted after adjustment for potential confounding factors (birth weight, height, and age at lung function testing). Results are presented per interquartile range increase (3.5 kg/year) in PWV.\n\nPWV was negatively associated with pre-bronchodilation flow rates after extensive adjustment for potential confounders including asthma: forced expiratory flow at 50% of forced vital capacity (FEF50 ) decreased by 141 ml/s (95%CI =\\u2009[-225;-57]), FEF75 by 84 ml/s [-144;-24] and FEF25-75 by 118 ml/s [-192;-44]. FEV1 /FVC was also negatively associated with PWV (-0.750% [-1.273;-0.226]) whereas forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1 ) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were not. Similar results were found for measurements post-bronchodilation.",
        "Hyperglycaemia is a common complication of prematurity and is associated with neonatal mortality and morbidity, yet the aetiology is incompletely understood. C-peptide has been used in adults to estimate endogenous insulin secretion due to its simple clearance kinetics.\n\nTo determine insulin secretion calculated from plasma C-peptide concentrations in hyperglycaemic preterm babies.\n\nThis is a retrospective analysis of a cohort of 41 very preterm babies with a median gestational age of 27.2 weeks (26.2-28.7) enrolled in a randomised controlled trial of tight glycaemic control when they developed hyperglycaemia (2 consecutive blood glucose concentrations, BGC, > 8.5 mmol\u00b7l(-1)). Insulin secretion was determined using a steady state analysis of a 2-compartment C-peptide kinetic model.\n\nBGC, plasma insulin concentration, plasma C-peptide concentrations, and insulin secretion were higher at randomisation than 1-2 weeks following randomisation (p \u2264 0.02). Insulin secretion was higher in girls at 11.7 mU\u00b7l(-1)\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1) (5.3-18.7) vs. 4.7 mU\u00b7l(-1)\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1) (2.1-8.3; p < 0.005), with no difference in clinical characteristics, BGC, plasma insulin concentration, or nutrition between the sexes (p > 0.25). Insulin secretion was lower in samples taken during exogenous insulin delivery at 3.7 mU\u00b7l(-1)\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1) (1.8-6.9) vs. 9.8 mU\u00b7l(-1)\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7min(-1) (4.7-17.8; p = 0.02).",
        "To evaluate the prognostic value of global longitudinal strain (GLS) and basal longitudinal strain (BLS) with the knowledge of coexisting coronary pathology evaluated by multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) coronary angiography.\n\nGLS and BLS are both sensitive markers of myocardial dysfunction and predictors of outcome in asymptomatic aortic stenosis. Aortic stenosis and ischaemic heart disease share risk factors and longitudinal function can be severely reduced in both conditions, why some of the previous findings of impaired regional longitudinal function in asymptomatic aortic stenosis could in fact be explained by silent ischaemic heart disease.\n\nProspective follow-up of 104 asymptomatic patients with moderate-severe aortic stenosis defined as an aortic valve area <1.5 cm(2). Patients underwent a thorough clinical work-up, advanced echocardiographic analysis and coronary angiography by MDCT. The combined endpoint was indication for aortic valve replacement (AVR) and sudden cardiac death. During a median follow-up of 2.3 years (interquartile range 1.7-3.6) 43 patients (41%) met the endpoint of indication for AVR. The basal (13.4 \u00b1 3.1% vs. 15.7 \u00b1 3.1%) and mid-ventricular segments (14.9 \u00b1 2.7% vs. 16.2 \u00b1 2.9%) were significantly reduced, but with sparing of the apical segments, in patients who later underwent AVR. In various multivariable Cox regression models, including only BLS, but not GLS, remained an independent predictor of AVR.",
        "Blood-borne biomarkers reflecting atherosclerotic plaque burden have great potential to improve clinical management of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease and acute coronary syndrome (ACS).\n\nUsing data integration from gene expression profiling of coronary thrombi versus peripheral blood mononuclear cells and proteomic analysis of atherosclerotic plaque-derived secretomes versus healthy tissue secretomes, we identified fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) as a biomarker candidate for coronary artery disease. Its diagnostic and prognostic performance was validated in 3 different clinical settings: (1) in a cross-sectional cohort of patients with stable coronary artery disease, ACS, and healthy individuals (n=820), (2) in a nested case-control cohort of patients with ACS with 30-day follow-up (n=200), and (3) in a population-based nested case-control cohort of asymptomatic individuals with 5-year follow-up (n=414). Circulating FABP4 was marginally higher in patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (24.9 ng/mL) compared with controls (23.4 ng/mL; P=0.01). However, elevated FABP4 was associated with adverse secondary cerebrovascular or cardiovascular events during 30-day follow-up after index ACS, independent of age, sex, renal function, and body mass index (odds ratio, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-2.5; P=0.02). Circulating FABP4 predicted adverse events with similar prognostic performance as the GRACE in-hospital risk score or N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide. Finally, no significant difference between baseline FABP4 was found in asymptomatic individuals with or without coronary events during 5-year follow-up.",
        "Inhibitory molecules in the adult central nervous system, including NogoA, impede neural repair by blocking axon outgrowth. The actin-myosin regulatory protein Shroom3 directly interacts with Rho kinase and conveys axon outgrowth inhibitory signals from Nogo66, a C-terminal inhibitory domain of NogoA. The purpose of this study was to identify small molecules that block the Shroom3-Rho kinase protein-protein interaction as a means to modulate NogoA signaling and, in the longer term, enhance axon outgrowth during neural repair.\n\nA high throughput screen for inhibitors of the Shroom3-Rho kinase protein-protein interaction identified CCG-17444 (Chem ID: 2816053). CCG-17444 inhibits the Shroom3-Rho kinase interaction in vitro with micromolar potency. This compound acts through an irreversible, covalent mechanism of action, targeting Shroom3 Cys1816 to inhibit the Shroom3-Rho kinase protein-protein interaction. Inhibition of the Shroom3-Rho kinase protein-protein interaction with CCG-17444 counteracts the inhibitory action of Nogo66 and enhances neurite outgrowth.",
        "During fluid infusion therapy, plasma proteins are diluted and leak from the intravascular space, which alters the colloid osmotic pressure (COP) and potentially affects coagulation. We hypothesised that acetated Ringer\"s and starch solution, alone or in combination, influence these mechanisms differently.\n\nOn different occasions, 10 male volunteers were infused with 20\\xa0ml/kg acetated Ringer\"s and 10\\xa0ml/kg 6% hyroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 (Voluven(\u00ae) ) alone or in combination (first with starch solution followed by Ringer\"s solution). Blood samples were collected every 30-min for measurements of COP, blood haemoglobin, platelets, and plasma concentrations of albumin, immunoglobulins (IgG and IgM), coagulation factor VII (FVII), fibrinogen, cystatin C, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and prothrombin international normalised ratio (PT-INR). Changes were compared with the haemoglobin-derived plasma dilution.\n\nThe COP increased by 8.4% (SD 3) with starch and decreased by 26.2% (7.9) with Ringer\"s. These infusions diluted the plasma by 23.4% (5.3) and 18.7% (4.9) respectively. The COP changes in the combined experiment followed the same pattern as the individual infusions. Albumin and IgG changes in excess of the plasma dilution were very subtle. The intravascular contents of the IgM and platelets decreased, whereas FVII, fibrinogen and cystatin C increased. PT-INR increased by 1/3 of the plasma dilution, whereas changes in APTT did not correlate with the plasma dilution.",
        "Nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB), receptor activator of NF-\u03baB (RANK), and RANK ligand (RANKL) are transcriptional regulators of inflammatory cytokines. RANKL expression in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons is elevated in animal models of pain or intervertebral disc herniation. We sought to evaluate the effect of anti-RANKL antibodies on sensory nerves innervating injured intervertebral discs.\n\nWe labeled DRG neurons innervating L5-6 discs with FluoroGold (FG). The L5-6 discs of 36 rats were punctured using a 23-gage needle and 18 rats underwent sham surgery without disc puncture. The puncture group was evenly subdivided into a group in which 10 \u03bcl saline was administered to the injured disc and a group in which 10 \u03bcl of anti-RANKL antibody was administered. Seven and 14 days postsurgery, DRGs at L2 level were harvested, sectioned, and immunostained for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). The proportion of CGRP-immunoreactive (IR) DRG neurons of all FG-positive neurons was determined. Amount of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and interleukin(IL)-6 was measured within the intervertebral discs in each group at 7 and 14 days after surgery using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).\n\nThe proportion of CGRP-IR DRG neurons to total FG-labeled neurons innervating injured intervertebral discs and amount of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in the injured discs in the saline control group was significantly increased compared with that found in rats from the sham surgery group (P < 0.05). However, application of anti-RANKL antibody to the injured discs significantly decreased the proportion of CGRP-IR DRG neurons to total FG-labeled neurons and amount of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in the injured discs (P < 0.05).",
        "To explore the anti-nociceptive effects of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) on bone cancer pain in mice.\n\nThe model of bone cancer pain was established by an inoculation of prostate tumor cell line RM-1 cells into intramedullary space of murine femur. Bone destruction and tumor formation in femur were checked by hematoxylin and eosin staining. The mechanical allodynia and heat hyperalgesia were examined by behavioral testing. After intraperitoneal injections of HO-1 inducer (CoPP) and HO-1 inhibitor (SnPP), the protein content of HO-1 in spinal cord was examined by Western blot.\n\nThe invasion of tumor cells into bone and bone destruction were induced by an injection of RM-1 into right femur. The paw withdrawal threshold (PWL) and paw withdrawal latency (PWL) decreased significantly at 7 days after inoculation and maintained for over 21 days. HO-1 inducer CoPP increased PWT and PWL dramatically in mice with bone cancer pain after consecutive intraperitoneal dosing of CoPP for 5 days. However, SnPP unaltered pain behaviors. Western blot showed the expression of HO-1 in spinal cord was up-regulated after an intraperitoneal injection of CoPP and unchanged after an intraperitoneal injection of SnPP.",
        "To identify the individual genes or gene modules that lead to the OncoptypeDx 21-gene recurrence score\"s reduced performance after 5 years and thereby identify indices of residual risk that may guide selection of patients for extended adjuvant therapy.\n\nWe conducted a retrospective assessment of the relationship between (i) the individual genes and gene modules of the Recurrence Score and (ii) early (0-5 years) and late (5-10 years) recurrence rates in 1,125 postmenopausal patients with primary estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer treated with anastrozole or tamoxifen in the Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or Combined (ATAC) randomized clinical trial.\n\nIn the HER2-negative population (n = 1,009), estimates of recurrence risk were similar between years 0-5 and 5-10 for proliferation and invasion modules but markedly different for the estrogen module and genes within it (all split at the median): for low estrogen module, annual recurrence rates were similar across the two time windows (2.06% vs. 2.46%, respectively); for high estrogen module, annual rates were 1.14% versus 2.72%, respectively (P interaction = 0.004). Estrogen receptor transcript levels showed inverse prediction across the time windows: HR, 0.88 (0.73-1.07) and 1.19 (0.99-1.43), respectively (P interaction = 0.03). Similar time-, module-, and estrogen-dependent relationships were seen for distant recurrence.",
        "This study investigated whether texture-based imaging parameters could identify invasive components of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).\n\nWe enrolled 65 biopsy-confirmed DCIS patients (62 unilateral, 3 bilateral) who underwent (18)\\u2009F-FDG PET, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), or breast-specific gamma imaging (BSGI). We measured SUV max and intratumoral metabolic heterogeneity by the area under the curve (AUC) of cumulative SUV histograms (CSH) on PET, tumour-to-normal ratio (TNR) and coefficient of variation (COV) as an index of heterogeneity on BSGI, minimum ADC (ADC min ) and ADC difference (ADC diff ) as an index of heterogeneity on DWI. After surgery, final pathology was categorized as pure-DCIS (DCIS-P), DCIS with microinvasion (DCIS-MI), or invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Clinicopathologic features of DCIS were correlated with final classification.\n\nFinal pathology confirmed 44 DCIS-P, 14 DCIS-MI, and 10 IDC. The invasive component of DCIS was significantly correlated with higher SUV max (p\\u2009=\\u20090.017) and lower AUC-CSH (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001) on PET, higher TNR (p\\u2009=\\u20090.008) and COV (p\\u2009=\\u20090.035) on BSGI, lower ADC min (p\\u2009=\\u20090.016) and higher ADC diff (p\\u2009=\\u20090.009) on DWI, and larger pathologic size (p\\u2009=\\u20090.018). On multiple regression analysis, AUC-CSH was the only significant predictor of invasive components (p\\u2009=\\u20090.044).",
        "Amino acid imbalance is often found in patients with cirrhosis, and this imbalance is associated with insulin resistance. However, the mechanism underlying the relationship between amino acid imbalance and insulin resistance remains unclear. We evaluated serum amino acid concentrations in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease to determine if any of the levels of amino acids were associated with the biochemical markers and fibrosis stage of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).\n\nIn 137 patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease who underwent liver biopsy, plasma levels of branched-chain amino acid (BCAA), tyrosine (Tyr), and the BCAA-to-Tyr ratio values were determined using mass spectroscopy. These values were then assessed for associations with fibrosis stage, anthropometric markers (age, sex, and body mass index), biochemical markers (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase, albumin, platelet count, total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glycosylated hemoglobin), and relevant disease-specific biomarkers (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR], serum iron, ferritin, leptin, adiponectin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and hyaluronic acid).\n\nSerum albumin levels, plasma BCAA levels, and BCAA-to-Tyr ratio values were negatively associated with the fibrosis stage. In contrast, Tyr levels increased with increasing fibrotic staging. Tyr levels were also correlated with HOMA-IR results.",
        "We aimed to evaluate the value of AST to platelet ratio (APRI) and transient elastography (TE) as predictors of liver histopathology in children with intestinal failure (IF).\n\nAltogether 93 liver biopsies from 57 children with parenteral nutrition (PN) duration \u22653 months were analysed. APRI measurement and TE (n = 46) were performed at the time of biopsy.\n\nIF was caused by short bowel syndrome in 75% of patients. At the time of liver biopsy, PN dependent patients (n = 42) were younger with longer PN duration compared to those weaned off PN (n = 51) (2.2 vs. 7.6 years, P < 0.001; 26 vs. 10.5 months, P = 0.043). Elevated transaminase or bilirubin levels were found in 51%, splenomegaly in 26%, and oesophageal varices in 3.5%. Histological fibrosis was present in 61% (Metavir stage F1; 27%, F2; 26%, F3-4; 9%), cholestasis in 25% and steatosis in 22% of biopsy specimens. TE was superior to APRI in prediction of any liver histopathology (fibrosis, cholestasis or steatosis) with areas under the receiving operating curve (AUROC) of 0.86 (95% CI 0.74-0.97) and 0.67 (95% CI 0.58-0.78) respectively. For prediction of \u2265F1 and \u2265F2 fibrosis, AUROC values for TE were 0.78 (95% CI 0.64-0.93) and 0.73 (95% CI 0.59-0.88), whereas APRI did not correlate with fibrosis stages. For detection of histological cholestasis, the AUROC for APRI was 0.77 (95% CI 0.64-0.89).",
        "High digestible carbohydrate intakes can induce hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia and collectively have been implicated in colorectal tumor development.

        "Once gastrointestinal (GI) graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) occurs after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, it may be life-threatening. Therefore, an earlier accurate diagnosis of macroscopic and microscopic features using an appropriate modality improves the prognosis of patients with suspected GI-GVHD.\n\nIn patients experiencing watery diarrhea within 100 days after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, we evaluated the severity of mucosal injury at the proximal ileum, terminal ileum, and rectum according to previously reported criteria using transanal single balloon endoscopy. GI-GVHD was diagnosed by the presence of gland apoptosis without inflammatory or infectious factors in the biopsied specimens obtained from their respective site regardless of the mucosal lesion.\n\nConsecutive suspected GI-GVHD patients with watery diarrhea (11 men and 5 women, mean age: 45.6 years, coexistent symptoms: nausea [38%] and exanthema [69%]) were enrolled. GI-GVHD was identified pathologically in 11 patients (69%), all of whom had pathological findings of GI-GVHD at the rectum. However, eight patients (73%) had pathological findings of GI-GVHD at both the ileum and the rectum and none had pathological findings of GI-GVHD at the ileum alone. The accuracies for a pathological diagnosis of GI-GVHD based on endoscopic features were 44%, 44%, and 38% at the proximal ileum, terminal ileum, and rectum, respectively. The severity of mucosal injury had no association with the diagnostic rate of pathological GI-GVHD at any site.",
        "Guanidinoacetic acid (GAA), a natural precursor of creatine, is a new promising dietary supplement, yet its performance-enhancing effect, if any, has yet to be established. The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the effects of supplemental GAA on muscle strength, anaerobic performance, and aerobic performance in healthy men and women.\n\nThe study enrolled 48 young participants (age, 22.3 \u00b1 1.5 years; height, 176.4 \u00b1 10.0 cm; weight, 71.9 \u00b1 14.3 kg), who received oral doses of GAA (1.2, 2.4, or 4.8 g/d) for 6 weeks in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials.\n\nSignificant differences were observed between treatment groups for handgrip strength among participants receiving 1.2 g of GAA per day and 2.4 g of GAA per day, as compared with placebo (P < 0.05). In addition, muscle endurance expressed as the change from baseline in repetitions performed in the bench press exercise was significantly greater in the 1.2 g/d dose of GAA (P = 0.01) and the 4.8 g/d dose (P = 0.01) compared with placebo. No dose-response differences were found between trials.",
        "Even though admission time is reduced with the implementation of various enhanced recovery protocols, many clinics still instruct patients after weight loss surgery to maintain a fluid or minced-food diet for at least 2 weeks postoperatively. We reasoned that with adequate preoperative instructions, including adequate chewing of all foods, early progression to solid foods would not increase the risk of (gastro)enterostomy leakage.\n\nIn December 2010, a new dietary protocol was implemented for all patients undergoing a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, allowing progression to solid foods from 12 h postprocedure onwards. All patients received thorough preoperative eating instructions and eating awareness counselling from a qualified dietician and psychologist. A retrospective study was performed of 936 patients who underwent a primary or redo laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass between January 2011 and June 2014 in our hospital. All 30-day complications, readmissions and reoperations were noted.\n\nNo 30-day loss to follow-up occurred. Overall 30-day complication rate was 9.4%, with gastrointestinal leakage occurring in only 0.6%. A low threshold for readmission was maintained due to the short mean admission time of 1.87 days. Readmission rate was 4.8%--mainly for observation of postoperative pain--and 1.8% of our patients required reoperation within 30 days. Mortality was 0.1%. Our results are comparable to results published by other Dutch centres advocating conventional diets, showing no increase in leakage or other complications.",
        "Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are a class of small RNAs; distinct types of piRNAs are expressed in the mammalian testis at different stages of development. The function of piRNAs expressed in the adult testis is not well established. We conducted a detailed characterization of piRNAs aligning at or near the 3\" UTRs of protein-coding genes in a deep dataset of small RNAs from adult mouse testis.\n\nWe identified 2710 piRNA clusters associated with 3\" UTRs, including 1600 that overlapped genes not previously associated with piRNAs. 35% of the clusters extend beyond the annotated transcript; we find that these clusters correspond to, and are likely derived from, novel polyadenylated mRNA isoforms that contain previously unannotated extended 3\"UTRs. Extended 3\" UTRs, and small RNAs derived from them, are also present in somatic tissues; a subset of these somatic 3\"UTR small RNA clusters are absent in mice lacking MIWI2, indicating a role for MIWI2 in the metabolism of somatic small RNAs.",
        "Oral infection of C57BL/6J mice with the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii leads to a lethal inflammatory ileitis.\n\nMice lacking the purinergic receptor P2X7R are acutely susceptible to toxoplasmic ileitis, losing significantly more weight than C57BL/6J mice and exhibiting much greater intestinal inflammatory pathology in response to infection with only 10 cysts of T. gondii. This susceptibility is not dependent on the ability of P2X7R-deficient mice to control the parasite, which they accomplish just as efficiently as C57BL/6J mice. Rather, susceptibility is associated with elevated ileal concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines, reactive nitrogen intermediates and altered regulation of elements of NF\u03baB activation in P2X7R-deficient mice.",
        "The aim of this paper was to evaluate socio-economic factors associated to poor primary care utilization by studying two specific subjects: the hospital readmission rate, and the use of the Emergency Department (ED) for non-urgent visits.\n\nThe study was carried out by the analysis of administrative database for hospital readmission and with a specific survey for non-urgent ED use.\n\nAmong the 416,698 sampled admissions, 6.39% (95% CI, 6.32-6.47) of re-admissions have been registered; the distribution shows a high frequency of events in the age 65-84 years group, and in the intermediate care hospitals (51.97%; 95%CI 51.37-52.57). The regression model has shown the significant role played by age, type of structure (geriatric acute care), and deprivation index of the area of residence on the readmission, however, after adjusting for the intensity of primary care, the role of deprivation was no more significant. Non-urgent ED visits accounted for the 12.10%, (95%CI 9.38-15.27) of the total number of respondents to the questionnaire (N = 504). The likelihood of performing a non-urgent ED visit was higher among patients aged <65 years (OR 3.2, 95%CI 1.3-7.8 p = 0.008), while it was lower among those perceiving as urgent their health problem (OR 0.50, 95%CI 0.30-0.90).",
        "The metabolic effect of intratumor cholesteryl ester (CE) in breast cancer remains poorly understood.

We analyzed intratumor neutral CE, free cholesterol (FC) and triglyceride (TG) content by thin layer chromatography after lipid extraction. RNA and protein levels of lipid metabolism and invasion mediators were analyzed by real time PCR and Western blot analysis.\n\nGroup-wise comparisons, linear regression and logistic regression models showed a close association between CE-rich tumors and higher histologic grade, Ki-67 and tumor necrosis. CE-rich tumors displayed higher mRNA and protein levels of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and scavenger receptor class B member 1 (SCARB1). An increased expression of acetyl-Coenzyme A acetyltransferase 1 (ACAT1) in CE-rich tumors was also reported.",

Patients\" self-reporting and driving behaviours were assessed using a standardized interview prior to a neurologist\"s counseling and later at a follow-up visit.\n\nSixty three patients were included; 77% were diagnosed as having had a seizure at the time of their referral. Prior to their seizure clinic visit, 3/63 (5%) had been counseled to self-report to the TR by a non-neurologist physician, and none had done so. Following a neurologist\"s documented counseling 34/63 (54%) had self-reported themselves at the follow-up seizure clinic visit, and 53/63 (84%) were not driving.",
        "Lenticulostriate vasculopathy is associated with various disorders, in particular cytomegalovirus infection, which can cause neurological consequences. We wanted to evaluate the association of lenticulostriate vasculopathy and cytomegalovirus infection. We retrospectively collected data on lenticulostriate vasculopathy from 858 neonatal ultrasonography scans.\n\nFifty-five patients with lenticulostriate vasculopathy were diagnosed. Lenticulostriate vasculopathy was classified as severe and mild according to the ultrasonographic findings. We analyzed gender, unilateral and bilateral lenticulostriate vasculopathy, mild and severe lenticulostriate vasculopathy, intrauterine growth retardation, and lenticulostriate vasculopathy associated with other brain malformations to determine whether they were correlated with cytomegalovirus infection.\n\nNeonatal cytomegalovirus infections correlated primarily with lenticulostriate vasculopathy that was associated with brain structure anomalies p\\xa0<\\xa00.0001, followed by severe lenticulostriate vasculopathy (p\\xa0=\\xa00.029). Cytomegalovirus urine polymerase chain reaction ratios were 69% for severe and 23% for mild lenticulostriate vasculopathy (p\\xa0=\\xa00.002; odds ratio\\xa0=\\xa07.33). Of 72 newborns with intrauterine growth retardation without lenticulostriate vasculopathy, 33 were analyzed for cytomegalovirus, of whom only one was positive, which was significantly different from the newborns with lenticulostriate vasculopathy (p\\xa0=\\xa00.003; odds ratio\\xa0=\\xa011.64).",
        "Tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) is generally caused by small benign mesenchymal tumors producing fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23). The only curative therapy of the disease is resection of the causative tumors. However, these tumors are extremely difficult to detect using conventional imaging modalities. This research was undertaken to evaluate efficacy of (68)Ga DOTATATE PET/CT in this clinical setting.\n\nImages of (68)Ga DOTATATE PET/CT and clinical charts from 54 patients with clinically suspected TIO were retrospectively reviewed. The image findings were compared with the results of histopathological examinations and clinical follow-ups.\n\n(68)Ga DOTATATE PET/CT scans were positive in 44 patients, among which, 33 had surgery to remove the lesions. Postsurgical pathological examination confirmed causative tumors in 32 patients whose symptoms diminished promptly, and the serum phosphate levels became normal, which confirmed the diagnoses of TIO. Eleven patients with positive (68)Ga DOTATATE PET/CT did not have surgery. These 11 patients continued to have symptoms and hypophosphatemia but were not included in the final analysis because of lack of evidence to confirm or exclude TIO. Ten patients had negative (68)Ga DOTATATE PET/CT scans. All of these10 patients responded to conservative therapy and had normal serum phosphate levels in the follow-up, which excluded TIO. Therefore, the (68)Ga DOTATATE PET/CT imaging had a sensitivity of 100% (32/32) and a specificity of 90.9% (10/11). The overall accuracy of (68)Ga DOTATATE PET/CT scan in the detection of tumors responsible for osteomalacia is 97.7% (42/43).",
        "Redox enzyme maturation proteins (REMPs) describe a diverse family of prokaryotic chaperones involved in the biogenesis of anaerobic complex iron sulfur molybdoenzyme (CISM) respiratory systems. Many REMP family studies have focused on NarJ subfamily members from Escherichia coli: NarJ, NarW, DmsD, TorD and YcdY. The aim of this bioinformatics study was to expand upon the evolution, distribution and genetic association of these 5 REMP members within 130 genome sequenced taxonomically diverse species representing 324 Prokaryotic sequences. NarJ subfamily member diversity was examined at the phylum-species level and at the amino acid/nucleotide level to determine how close their genetic associations were between their respective CISM systems within phyla.\n\nThis study revealed that NarJ members possessed unique motifs that distinguished Gram-negative from Gram-positive/Archaeal species and identified a strict genetic association with its nitrate reductase complex (narGHI) operon compared to all other members. NarW appears to be found specifically in Gammaproteobacteria. DmsD also showed close associations with the dimethylsulfoxide reductase (dmsABC) operon compared to TorD. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that YcdY has recently evolved from DmsD and that YcdY has likely diverged into 2 subfamilies linked to Zn- dependent alkaline phosphatase (ycdX) operons and a newly identified operon containing part of Zn-metallopeptidase FtsH complex component (hflC) and NADH-quinone dehydrogenase (mdaB). TorD demonstrated the greatest diversity in operon association. TorD was identifed within operons from either trimethylamine-N-oxide reductase (torAC) or formate dehydrogenase (fdhGHI), where each type of TorD had a unique motif. Additionally a subgroup of dmsD and torD members were also linked to operons with biotin sulfoxide (bisC) and polysulfide reductase (nrfD) indicating a potential role in the maturation of diverse CISM.",
        "Halo fixation is now universally performed in the initial reduction and fixation of unstable upper cervical spine injuries; however, persistent high instability and recurrent dislocations of the atlantooccipital and atlantoaxial joints after fixation are not well recognized.\n\nThe aim was to describe persistent instability of traumatic dislocations of the atlantooccipital and atlantoaxial joints after halo fixation and a useful method for preventing instability.\n\nThis was a case report of a patient who survived traumatic dislocations of the atlantooccipital and atlantoaxial joints.\n\nA 73-year-old woman diagnosed with dislocations of the atlantooccipital and atlantoaxial joints along with multiple other injuries sustained in a traffic accident was included.\n\nAfter initial closed reduction and halo fixation, congruity of the atlantooccipital and atlantoaxial joints was evaluated using, condylar gap, atlantodental interval, and flexion angulation of C1-C2 after the initial examination and before surgery.\n\nChanges in parameters 12 hours after halo fixation revealed re-dislocations and instability of the joints. Backrest elevation with halo fixation tended to reduce re-dislocations. Therefore, we carefully increased the backrest angle and measured the parameters at several angles of elevation within a range that did not affect vital signs to observe the effectiveness of elevation against re-dislocations. Elevation changed the parameters in an elevation angle-dependent manner, and these changes suggested that elevation was effective for reducing re-dislocation of both the atlantooccipital and atlantoaxial joints during halo fixation. With no major complications, this method enabled us to maintain good congruity of the joints for approximately 2 weeks until posterior spinal fusion with internal fixation.",
        "Peritonitis is a commonly seen disease with high morbidity and mortality. It is prevalently considered that the impaired intestinal barrier during peritonitis is the access point of gut microbes into the blood system, and acts as the engine of the following systemic infection. In our previous study, we found that Sodium Butyrate (NaB) was protective on intestinal barrier function. In this study, we aim to evaluate the effects of NaB on overwhelming infection animal models of peritonitis.\n\nMouse cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model was used to study the effects of NaB on the intestinal barrier. Experimental animals were fed of NaB by gavage. Post-CLP mortality, gut permeability and intestinal histological alterations were studied.\n\nGastrointestinal NaB pharmacodynamics profiles after medication were studied. Measurements of NaB concentration in chyme showed significantly higher intestinal concentration of NaB in the NaB treated group than that of the control group. CLP-induced mortality was significantly decreased by oral NaB treatments. Gut permeability was largely increased after CLP, which was partially prevented by NaB feeding. Histological study showed that intestinal, especially ileal injury following peritonitis was substantially alleviated by NaB treatments. Moreover, tissue regeneration was also prompted by NaB.",
        "Antarctic notothenioids are an impressive adaptive radiation. While they share recent common ancestry with several species-depauperate lineages that exhibit a relictual distribution in areas peripheral to the Southern Ocean, an understanding of their evolutionary origins and biogeographic history is limited as the sister lineage of notothenioids remains unidentified. The phylogenetic placement of notothenioids among major lineages of perciform fishes, which include sculpins, rockfishes, sticklebacks, eelpouts, scorpionfishes, perches, groupers and soapfishes, remains unresolved. We investigate the phylogenetic position of notothenioids using DNA sequences of 10 protein coding nuclear genes sampled from more than 650 percomorph species. The biogeographic history of notothenioids is reconstructed using a maximum likelihood method that integrates phylogenetic relationships, estimated divergence times, geographic distributions and paleogeographic history.\n\nPercophis brasiliensis is resolved, with strong node support, as the notothenioid sister lineage. The species is endemic to the subtropical and temperate Atlantic coast of southern South America. Biogeographic reconstructions imply the initial diversification of notothenioids involved the western portion of the East Gondwanan Weddellian Province. The geographic disjunctions among the major lineages of notothenioids show biogeographic and temporal correspondence with the fragmentation of East Gondwana.",
        "The study aimed to investigate whether endogenous H2S pathway was involved in high-salt-stimulated mitochondria-related vascular endothelial cell (VEC) apoptosis.\n\nCultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were used in the study. H2S content in the supernatant was detected. Western blot was used to detect expression of cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE), cleaved-caspase-3, and mitochondrial and cytosolic cytochrome c (cytc). Fluorescent probes were used to quantitatively detect superoxide anion generation and measure the in situ superoxide anion generation in HUVEC. Mitochondrial membrane pore opening, mitochondrial membrane potential, and caspase-9 activities were measured. The cell apoptosis was detected by cell death ELISA and TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) methods.\n\nHigh-salt treatment downregulated the endogenous VEC H2S/CSE pathway, in association with increased generation of oxygen free radicals, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, enhanced the opening of mitochondrial membrane permeability transition pore and leakage of mitochondrial cytc, activated cytoplasmic caspase-9 and caspase-3 and subsequently induced VEC apoptosis. However, supplementation of H2S donor markedly inhibited VEC oxidative stress and mitochondria-related VEC apoptosis induced by high salt.",
        "Malignant melanoma has an increasing incidence rate and the metastatic disease is notoriously resistant to standard chemotherapy. Loss of cell cycle checkpoints is frequently found in many cancer types and makes the cells reliant on compensatory mechanisms to control progression. This feature may be exploited in therapy, and kinases involved in checkpoint regulation, such as Wee1 and Chk1/2, have thus become attractive therapeutic targets.\n\nIn the present study we combined a Wee1 inhibitor (MK1775) with Chk1/2 inhibitor (AZD7762) in malignant melanoma cell lines grown in vitro (2D and 3D cultures) and in xenografts models.\n\nOur in vitro studies showed that combined inhibition of Wee1 and Chk1/2 synergistically decreased viability and increased apoptosis (cleavage of caspase 3 and PARP), which may be explained by accumulation of DNA-damage (increased expression of \u03b3-H2A.X)--and premature mitosis of S-phase cells. Compared to either inhibitor used as single agents, combined treatment reduced spheroid growth and led to greater tumour growth inhibition in melanoma xenografts.",
        "The influence of NODAT on survival of liver transplant recipients has not been clarified. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of NODAT on survival in LT recipients.\n\nData from 352 LT patients were totally analyzed. 97 patients with pretransplant diabetes mellitus were excluded, and 255 patients without diabetes mellitus at time of transplantation were included.\n\nNODAT was diagnosed in 41 patients (16.1%). There was no difference in frequency of NODAT according to the etiology of liver cirrhosis. NODAT was associated with a higher body weight (p=0.004) and BMI (p=0.002) 5years after LT, but not with weight gain (p=0.201) or increase in BMI (p=0.335) 5years after LT. HbA1c 5years after LT was significantly higher in patients with NODAT (p=0.001), but mean HbA1c still remained lower than 6.5% (6.4(\u00b11.2) %). Patients with NODAT showed better survival rates (log rank: p=0.002) compared to LT recipients without diabetes. According to all existing knowledge of diabetes mellitus (DM) better survival cannot be a direct effect of this disease. Our results are rather influenced by an not known confounding factor (possibly recovery from cachexia) associated with better survival and NODAT, while complications of NODAT will not appear during the relatively short postoperative time and observation period (mean follow up 6.08 (\u00b12.67) years).",
        "The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between chronic osteomyelitis and acute pancreatitis in Taiwan.\n\nThis was a population-based case-control study utilizing the database of the Taiwan National Health Insurance Program. We identified 7678 cases aged 20-84 with newly diagnosed acute pancreatitis during the period of 1998 to 2011. From the same database, 30,712 subjects without diagnosis of acute pancreatitis were selected as controls. The cases and controls were matched with sex, age and index year of diagnosing acute pancreatitis. The odds ratio with 95% confidence interval of acute pancreatitis associated with chronic osteomyelitis was examined by the multivariable unconditional logistic regression analysis.\n\nAfter adjustment for multiple confounders, the multivariable analysis showed that the adjusted odds ratio of acute pancreatitis was 1.93 for subjects with chronic osteomyelitis (95% confidence interval 1.01, 3.69), when compared with subjects without chronic osteomyelitis.",
        "Stunting affects 26.7% of children worldwide, and little is known about its effects on the outcomes of childhood pneumonia. We evaluated the effect of stunting on the outcomes of pneumonia among children enrolled in two large clinical trials.\n\nWe analysed data from two WHO and USAID-sponsored inpatient treatment trials, the Severe Pneumonia Evaluation Antimicrobial Research study (n\\xa0=\\xa0958) and the Amoxicillin Penicillin Pneumonia International Study (n\\xa0=\\xa01702), which enrolled children aged 2-59\\xa0months across 16 sites in LMICs. We assessed the effect of stunting (height-for-age Z score\\xa0<\\xa0-2) on treatment outcome and time to resolution of hypoxaemic pneumonia.\n\nAmong 2542 (96%) children with valid data for height, 28% were stunted and 12.8% failed treatment by 5\\xa0days. The failure rate among stunted patients was 16.0% vs. 11.5% among non-stunted patients [unadjusted RR\\xa0=\\xa01.24 (95% CI 1.08, 1.41); adjusted RR\\xa0=\\xa01.28 (95% CI 1.10, 1.48)]. An inverse relationship was observed between height and failure rates, even among non-stunted children. Among 845 patients with hypoxaemic pneumonia, stunting was associated with a lower probability of normalisation of respiratory rate [HR\\xa0=\\xa00.63 (95% CI 0.52, 0.75)] and oxygen saturation [HR\\xa0=\\xa00.74 (95% CI 0.61, 0.89)].",
        "To investigate the involvement of hsa-miRNA-195-5p (miR-195) in progression and prognosis of human prostate cancer.\n\nqRT-PCR was performed to detect miR-195 expression in both prostate cancer cell lines and clinical tissue samples. Its clinical significance was statistically analyzed. The roles of miR-195 and its candidate target gene, ribosomal protein S6 kinase, 70 kDa, polypeptide 1 (RPS6KB1) in prostate cancer progression were confirmed on the basis of both in vitro and in vivo systems.\n\nmiR-195 downregulation in prostate cancer tissues was significantly associated with high Gleason score (P = 0.001), positive metastasis failure (P < 0.001), and biochemical recurrence (BCR, P < 0.001). Survival analysis identified miR-195 as an independent prognostic factor for BCR-free survival of prostate cancer patients (P = 0.022). Then, we confirmed the tumor suppressive role of miR-195 through prostate cancer cell invasion, migration, and apoptosis assays in vitro, along with tumor xenograft growth, angiogenesis, and invasion in vivo according to both gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments. In addition, RPS6KB1 was identified as a novel direct target of miR-195 through proteomic expression profiling combined with bioinformatic target prediction and luciferase reporter assay. Moreover, the reexpression and knockdown of RPS6KB1 could respectively rescue and imitate the effects induced by miR-195. Importantly, RPS6KB1 expression was closely correlated with aggressive progression and poor prognosis in prostate cancer patients as opposed to miR-195. Furthermore, we identified MMP-9, VEGF, BAD, and E-cadherin as the downstream effectors of miR-195-RPS6KB1 axis.",
        "The synthesis of rRNA is a key determinant of normal and malignant cell growth and subject to epigenetic regulation. Yet, the epigenomic features of rDNA arrays clustered in nucleolar organizer regions are largely unknown. We set out to explore for the first time how DNA methylation is distributed on individual rDNA arrays.\n\nHere we combined immunofluorescence detection of DNA modifications with fluorescence hybridization of single DNA fibers, metaphase immuno-FISH and methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme digestions followed by Southern blot.\n\nWe found clustering of both hypomethylated and hypermethylated repeat units and hypermethylation of noncanonical rDNA in IMR90 fibroblasts and HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells. Surprisingly, we also found transitions between hypo- and hypermethylated rDNA repeat clusters on single DNA fibers.",
        "Group identification has been shown to be associated with reduced risk of depression, but this research has important limitations. Our aim was to establish a robust link between group identification and depression whilst overcoming previous studies\" shortcomings.\n\n1824 participants, recruited from General Practice throughout Scotland, completed a questionnaire measuring their identification with three groups (family, community, and a group of their choice), as well as their intensity of contact with each group. They also completed a self-rated depression measure and provided demographic information. Their medical records were also accessed to determine if they had been prescribed antidepressants in the previous 6\\xa0months.\n\nThe number of group identifications was associated with both lower self-rated depression and lower odds of having received a prescription for antidepressants, even after controlling for the number of contact-intensive groups, level of education, gender, age, and relationship status.",
        "Although abdominal muscle morphology is symmetrical in the general population, asymmetry has been identified in rotation sports. This asymmetry includes greater thickness of obliquus internus abdominis (OI) on the non-dominant side in cricketers. Cricket fast bowlers commonly experience low back pain (LBP) related to bowling action, and this depends on trunk muscle control. This study aimed to compare abdominal muscle thickness between fast bowlers with and without LBP.\n\nCross sectional descriptive study.\n\nTwenty-five adolescent provincial league specialist fast bowlers (16 with and 9 without LBP) participated. Static ultrasound images (US) of OI, and obliquus externus (OE) and transversus abdominis (TrA) were captured on the dominant and non-dominant side in supine.\n\nTotal combined thickness of OE, OI and TrA muscles was greater on the non-dominant than dominant side (p=0.02) for fast bowlers without LBP, but symmetrical for those with pain. Total thickness was less on the non-dominant side for bowlers with pain than those without (p=0.03). When individual muscles were compared, only the thickness of OI was less in bowlers with LBP than those without (p=0.02). All abdominal muscles were thicker on the non-dominant side in controls (p<0.001) but symmetrical in LBP.",
        "The aim of this study was to investigate possible differences in the organisation of the motor cortex in people with knee osteoarthritis (OA) and whether there is an association between cortical organisation and accuracy of a motor task.\n\nfMRI data were collected while 11 participants with moderate/severe right knee OA (6 male, 69 \u00b1 6 (mean \u00b1 SD) years) and seven asymptomatic controls (5 male, 64 \u00b1 6 years) performed three visually guided, variable force, force matching motor tasks involving isolated isometric muscle contractions of: 1) quadriceps (knee), 2) tibialis anterior (ankle) and, 3) finger/thumb flexor (hand) muscles. fMRI data were used to map the loci of peak activation in the motor cortex during the three tasks and to assess whether there were differences in the organisation of the motor cortex between the groups for the three motor tasks. Root mean square of the difference between target and generated forces during muscle contraction quantified task accuracy.\n\nA 4.1 mm anterior shift in the representation of the knee (p = 0.03) and swap of the relative position of the knee and ankle representations in the motor cortex (p = 0.003) were found in people with knee OA. Poorer performance of the knee task was associated with more anterior placement of motor cortex loci in people with (p = 0.05) and without (p = 0.02) knee OA.",
        "The bioavailability of \u03b2-carotene, the main dietary provitamin A carotenoid, varies among individuals. It is not known whether this variability can affect long-term \u03b2-carotene, and hence vitamin A, status.\n\nWe hypothesized that variations in genes involved in \u03b2-carotene absorption and postprandial metabolism could at least partially explain the high interindividual variability in \u03b2-carotene bioavailability. Thus, the main objectives of this study were to identify associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and to estimate whether populations with different allele frequencies at these SNPs could have different abilities to absorb provitamin A carotenoids.\n\nIn this single-group design, 33 healthy, nonobese adult men were genotyped with the use of whole-genome microarrays. After an overnight fast, they consumed a test meal containing 100 g tomato puree providing 0.4 mg \u03b2-carotene. The postprandial plasma chylomicron \u03b2-carotene concentration was then measured at regular time intervals over 8 h. Partial least squares (PLS) regression was used to identify the best combination of SNPs in or near candidate genes (54 genes representing 2172 SNPs) that was associated with the postprandial chylomicron \u03b2-carotene response (incremental \u03b2-carotene area-under-the-curve concentration over 8 h in chylomicrons).\n\nThe postprandial chylomicron \u03b2-carotene response was highly variable (CV = 105%) and was positively correlated with the fasting plasma \u03b2-carotene concentration (r = 0.78; P < 0.0001). A significant (P = 6.54 \u00d7 10(-3)) multivalidated PLS regression model, which included 25 SNPs in 12 genes, explained 69% of the variance in the postprandial chylomicron \u03b2-carotene response, i.e., \u03b2-carotene bioavailability.",
        "Stroke-induced impairments result from both primary and secondary causes, i.e. damage to the brain and the acquired non-use of the impaired limbs. Indeed, stroke patients often under-utilize their paretic limb despite sufficient residual motor function. We hypothesize that acquired non-use can be overcome by reinforcement-based training strategies.\n\nHemiparetic stroke patients (n = 20, 11 males, 9 right-sided hemiparesis) were asked to reach targets appearing in either the real world or in a virtual environment. Sessions were divided into 3 phases: baseline, intervention and washout. During the intervention the movement of the virtual representation of the patients\" paretic limb was amplified towards the target.\n\nWe found that the probability of using the paretic limb during washout was significantly higher in comparison to baseline. Patients showed generalization of these results by displaying a more substantial workspace in real world task. These gains correlated with changes in effector selection patterns.",
        "We aimed to determine whether there was a relationship between lifestyle factors and Alzheimer disease biomarkers.\n\nIn a cross-sectional study, we evaluated self-reported histories of recent and past cognitive activity, self-reported history of recent physical activity, and objective recent walking activity in 186 clinically normal individuals with mean age of 74 \u00b1 6 years. Using backward elimination general linear models, we tested the hypotheses that greater cognitive or physical activity would be associated with lower Pittsburgh compound B-PET retention, greater (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET metabolism, and larger hippocampal volume, as well as better cognitive performance on neuropsychological testing.\n\nLinear regression demonstrated that history of greater cognitive activity was correlated with greater estimated IQ and education, as well as better neuropsychological testing performance. Self-reported recent physical activity was related to objective exercise monitoring. However, contrary to hypotheses, we did not find evidence of an association of Pittsburgh compound B retention, (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake, or hippocampal volume with past or current levels of cognitive activity, or with current physical activity.",
        "To determine whether laparoscopic endometrioma resection alters peri-implantation endometrial HOXA-10, HOXA-11, LIF, ITGB3 and ITGAV mRNA expression.\n\nCase-control study.\n\nMedical school.\n\nTwenty infertile patients with uni- or bilateral endometrioma, five infertile patients having nonendometriotic benign ovarian cyst, and five fertile control subjects.\n\nMid-luteal-phase endometrial sampling was performed at the time of surgery. Second endometrial biopsies were obtained 3 months after laparoscopic endometrioma resection during the mid-luteal phase of the cycle.\n\nEndometrial HOXA-10, HOXA-11, LIF, ITGAV, and ITGB3 mRNA expressions were evaluated with the use of reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.\n\nSignificantly decreased endometrial ITGAV mRNA expression was noted in biopsies obtained from endometrioma and nonendometriotic cyst groups before surgery. Trends toward decreased endometrial HOXA-10, HOXA-11, LIF, and ITGB3 mRNA expressions were noted in the endometrioma and nonendometriotic cyst groups before surgery compared with the fertile subjects. However, the differences failed to show statistical significance. Compared with preoperative values, significantly increased HOXA-10 (12.1-fold change) and HOXA-11 (17.2-fold change) mRNA expressions were noted in endometrial biopsies obtained from subjects who were undergoing endometrioma surgery. Fold change in endometrial ITGAV mRNA after endometrioma surgery was found to be 30.1 and indicated a positive regulation. However, this fold increase was statistically insignificant. Expressions of these endometrial receptivity markers did not change significantly after surgical removal of nonendometriotic benign ovarian cysts.",
        "The aim of this paper was to investigate the relationship between circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and cardio-metabolic risk factors in a large cohort of obese youth attending tertiary paediatric obesity services.\n\nWe conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study. Data were retrospectively collected from all new consultations of children and adolescents attending obesity outpatient clinics between 2008 and 2011 at the two major paediatric hospitals in Melbourne, Australia. Information collected included demographics, anthropometry, blood pressure, pubertal staging, body composition and fasting serum levels of 25(OH)D, glucose, insulin, cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein, liver function, calcium and phosphate.\n\n25(OH)D data were available in 229 patients (age 3-18 years; 116 men; mean (standard deviation) body mass index ( BMI) Z-score 2.5 (0.5)\\u2009). One hundred four (45%) participants were 25(OH)D deficient (<50\\u2009nmol/L). Lower serum 25(OH)D levels were associated with higher BMI Z-score (P-trend = 0.001), total fat mass (P-trend = 0.009), systolic (P-trend = 0.03) and diastolic blood pressures(P-trend = 0.009). In multivariable-adjusted regression analysis, 25(OH)D was significantly lower in those with elevated blood pressure after adjustment for BMI(P-trend = 0.004) or total fat mass (P-trend = 0.01).",
        "Radical prostatectomy (RP) is a primary treatment option for men with intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer. Although many are effectively cured with local therapy alone, these men are by definition at higher risk of adverse pathologic features and clinical disease recurrence. It has been shown that the Decipher test predicts metastatic progression in cohorts that received adjuvant and salvage therapy following RP.\n\nTo evaluate the Decipher genomic classifier in a natural history cohort of men at risk who received no additional treatment until the time of metastatic progression.\n\nRetrospective case-cohort design for 356 men who underwent RP between 1992 and 2010 at intermediate or high risk and received no additional treatment until the time of metastasis. Participants met the following criteria: (1) Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment postsurgical (CAPRA-S) score \u22653; (2) pathologic Gleason score \u22657; and (3) post-RP prostate-specific antigen nadir <0.2 ng/ml.\n\nThe primary endpoint was defined as regional or distant metastases. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, extension of decision curve analysis to survival data, and univariable and multivariable Cox proportional-hazards models were used to measure the discrimination, net benefit, and prognostic potential of genomic and pathologic risk factors. Cumulative incidence curves were constructed using Fine-Gray competing-risks analysis with appropriate weighting of the controls to account for the case-cohort study design.",
        "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance may improve the accuracy of Gleason score (GS) determination by directing the biopsy to regions of interest (ROI) that are likely to harbor high-grade prostate cancer (CaP). The aim of this study was to determine the frequency and predictors of GS upgrading when a subsequent MRI-guided biopsy is performed on patients with a diagnosis of GS 6 disease on the basis of conventional, transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy.\n\nA consecutive series of 245 men with a diagnosis of low-risk CaP (ie, cT1c, GS 6, prostate-specific antigen <10) based on transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy was enrolled in an active surveillance protocol that used subsequent MRI-guided biopsy for confirmation of GS. ROIs were categorized on a scale of 1 to 5. The Artemis ultrasound-MRI fusion device was used to perform targeted biopsies of ROIs as well as systematic biopsies from a software-based 12-point map. Predictors of GS upgrading were analyzed using univariate and multivariate analyses.\n\nFusion biopsy resulted in 26% of patients having GS upgrading (GS 3+4 in 18%, 4+3 in 5%, and 8-9 in 3%). Of the 72% of patients with ROIs appropriate for targeting, targeted cores upgraded the GS in 18%, whereas systematic cores upgraded the GS in 24%. In patients without targeted biopsy, GS upgrading was seen in 14%. On multivariate analysis, a category 5 ROI was the most significant predictor of GS upgrading with an odds ratio of 10.56 (P < .01).",
        "Early identification of potential recovery of postanoxic coma is a major challenge. We studied the additional predictive value of EEG.\n\nTwo hundred seventy-seven consecutive comatose patients after cardiac arrest were included in a prospective cohort study on 2 intensive care units. Continuous EEG was measured during the first 3 days. EEGs were classified as unfavorable (isoelectric, low-voltage, burst-suppression with identical bursts), intermediate, or favorable (continuous patterns), at 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours. Outcome was dichotomized as good or poor. Resuscitation, demographic, clinical, somatosensory evoked potential, and EEG measures were related to outcome at 6 months using logistic regression analysis. Analyses of diagnostic accuracy included receiver operating characteristics and calculation of predictive values.\n\nPoor outcome occurred in 149 patients (54%). Single measures unequivocally predicting poor outcome were an unfavorable EEG pattern at 24 hours, absent pupillary light responses at 48 hours, and absent somatosensory evoked potentials at 72 hours. Together, these had a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 50%. For the remaining 203 patients, who were still in the \"gray zone\" at 72 hours, a predictive model including unfavorable EEG patterns at 12 hours, absent or extensor motor response to pain at 72 hours, and higher age had an area under the curve of 0.90 (95% confidence interval 0.84-0.96). Favorable EEG patterns at 12 hours were strongly associated with good outcome. EEG beyond 24 hours had no additional predictive value.",
        "Leukocyte migration is critical for the infiltration of monocytes and accumulation of monocyte-derived macrophages in inflammation. Considering that Hck and Fgr are instrumental in this process, their impact on atherosclerosis and on lesion inflammation and stability was evaluated.\n\nHematopoietic Hck/Fgr-deficient, LDLr(-/-) chimeras, obtained by bone marrow transplantation, had smaller but, paradoxically, less stable lesions with reduced macrophage content, overt cap thinning, and necrotic core expansion as the most prominent features. Despite a Ly6C(high)-skewed proinflammatory monocyte phenotype, Hck/Fgr deficiency led to disrupted adhesion of myeloid cells to and transmigration across endothelial monolayers in vitro and atherosclerotic plaques in vivo, as assessed by intravital microscopy, flow cytometry, and histological examination of atherosclerotic arteries. Moreover, Hck/Fgr-deficient macrophages showed blunted podosome formation and mesenchymal migration capacity. In consequence, transmigrated double-knockout macrophages were seen to accumulate in the fibrous cap, potentially promoting its focal erosion, as observed for double-knockout chimeras.",
        "Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) of early gastric cancer is a minimally invasive procedure. However, the risk for metachronous cancers after successful cancer treatment remains high and the risk factors for metachronous cancers have not been elucidated.\n\nTo evaluate the risk factors for metachronous gastric cancers after ESD with a long-term follow-up.\n\nA total of 155 consecutive patients (119 men, 36 women, mean age 68.9 years) were treated with ESD between September 2000 and September 2009. Biopsy specimens were obtained from the greater curvature of the antrum and middle corpus to evaluate gastric mucosal status, including Helicobacter pylori, intestinal metaplasia (IM) and neutrophil infiltration (NI) before ESD. Follow-up endoscopy after ESD was scheduled at two and six months, one year and annually thereafter. H pylori eradication was recommended when possible.\n\nThe median follow-up period was 4.2 years. Metachronous gastric cancers were found in 23 of 155 patients (3.5% per year). No local recurrences were observed. The cumulative incidence of metachronous gastric cancer was significantly high in IM and NI in the corpus (P=0.0093 and P=0.0025, respectively [log-rank test]). The ORs for IM and NI in the corpus were 2.65 and 3.06, respectively, according to the Cox proportional hazards model (P=0.024 and P=0.0091, respectively).",
        "Both maternal obesity and disordered mood have adverse effects on pregnancy outcome. We hypothesized that maternal very severe obesity (SO) is associated with increased anxiety and depression (A&D) symptoms during pregnancy, with adverse effects on gestational weight gain (GWG), postpartum mood and postpartum weight retention (PPWR) and explored any mediation by circulating glucocorticoids.\n\nWe measured A&D symptoms with validated questionnaires at weeks 17 and 28 of pregnancy and 3 months postpartum in 135 lean [body mass index (BMI) \u2a7d25 kg/m2] and 222 SO (BMI \u2a7e40 kg/m2) pregnant women. Fasting serum cortisol was measured by radioimmunoassay; GWG and PPWR were recorded.\n\nA&D symptoms were higher in the SO group during pregnancy and postpartum despite adjusting for multiple confounders including previous mental health diagnosis (p < 0.05), and were non-linearly correlated with total GWG (anxiety R 2 = 0.06, p = 0.037; depression R 2 = 0.09, p = 0.001). In the SO group only, increased maternal anxiety (\u03b2 = 0.33, p = 0.03) and depression (\u03b2 = 0.19, p = 0.04) symptoms at week 17 of pregnancy were associated with increased PPWR, independent of total GWG and breastfeeding. Anxiety symptoms at week 28 of pregnancy, but not depression, were non-linearly correlated with serum cortisol level at week 36 of pregnancy (R 2 = 0.06, p = 0.02). Cortisol did not mediate the link between A&D symptoms and GWG.",
        "Hormones and their corresponding receptors are vital in controlling metabolism under normal physiologic and pathologic conditions, but less is known about their roles in the metabolism of cancer. Using a small interfering RNA screening approach, we examined the effects of silencing 20 well-known hormone receptors on the Warburg effect, specifically by measuring the production of lactate in four established hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines. We found that silencing a variety of hormone receptors had effects on the production of this metabolite. Unexpectedly silencing of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) significantly increased lactate production in all these HCC cell lines. Subsequent in vitro and in vivo studies showed that gain- and loss-of-function of MR significantly influenced HCC cellular proliferation, cell cycle distribution, and apoptosis. Furthermore, mechanistic studies revealed that MR as a transcriptional factor directly regulated the expression of miR-338-3p, suppressing the Warburg effects of HCC cells by targeting a key enzyme of glycolysis: pyruvate kinase, liver and red blood cells. Moreover, MR expression was significantly down-regulated in 81% of HCC patient tissues, caused by both chromosome deletion and histone deacetylation. Low expression of MR in tumor tissues was associated with poor patient prognosis. The expression level of miR-338-3p was found to positively correlate with the expression of MR in HCC tissues and to inversely correlate with expression of the enzyme pyruvate kinase, liver and red blood cells.",
        "Previous studies of CF treatments have shown suboptimal adherence, though little has been reported regarding adherence patterns to ivacaftor. Electronic monitoring (EM) of adherence is considered a gold standard of measurement.\n\nAdherence rates by EM were prospectively obtained and patterns over time were analyzed. EM-derived adherence rates were compared to pharmacy refill history and self-report.\n\n12 subjects (age 6-48 years; CFTR-G551D mutation) previously prescribed ivacaftor were monitored for a mean of 118 days. Overall adherence by EM was 61% (SD=28%) and decreased over time. Median duration between doses was 16.9 hours (IQR 13.9-24.1 hours) and increased over time. There was no correlation between EM-derived adherence and either refill history (84%, r=0.26, p=0.42) or self-report (100%, r=0.40, p=0.22).",
        "Red clover is an important source of isoflavones; which has been made commercially available as dietary supplements for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. Bioavailability and metabolism of these red clover isoflavones (RCI) have not been studied in detail. Fructooligosaccharides (FOS) stimulate the growth of intestinal bacteria and play an important role in the formation of certain isoflavone metabolites, such as equol and O-desmethylangolensin.\n\nTo determine the bioavailability of RCI metabolites and analyse whether FOS supplementation could influence their bioavailability.\n\nSeventeen healthy adults were enrolled in the study carried out in two periods. In the first, compound bioavailability was determined after consumption of 80 mg of RCI (MF11RCE). In the second, a 6-day supplementation of 2\u00d73000 mg/day of FOS was administered before isoflavone consumption.\n\nBiochanin A and formononetin were rapidly absorbed and both reached maximum concentrations at an average of 5-7h. Demethylation was a major reaction in the metabolic pathway. Daidzein serum level peaked after about 12.6h. Supplementation with FOS led to a significant decrease in the bioavailability of daidzein, dihydroformononetin, dihydrogenistein and dihydrodaidzein. An increase in equol production was also observed which did not reach statistical significance (p>0.05).",
        "Infantile flexible flatfoot does not require treatment in most cases. Symptomatic flexible flat feet are treated orthopaedically and surgery is only indicated when orthosis fails.\n\nCases who underwent surgical treatment with the stop screw technique at the 12 de Octubre Hospital between 1995 and 2002 are reported. Patient progress is also analysed. Six angles are measured on the x-ray prior to surgery and those same x-ray angles are measured again before material extraction. They are then compared to see if the correction achieved is statistically significant. A more reduced sample is currently being assessed with the same radiological measurements and two clinical assessment scales: Lickert, and Smith and Millar. The latest x-rays are analysed by two radiologists to determine if there is subtalar arthrosis.\n\nIn the short term, statistically significant differences are observed in all angles. The comparison between the post-surgery angles and the current angles does not show differences, except for the Giannestras angle, which has statistically significantly worsened. Clinical results and patient satisfaction is good. Incipient subtalar arthrosis is present in 68.5% of current patient x-rays.",
        "To characterize the relationship of proximal internal iliac artery (IIA) occlusion or embolization on prostate volume (PV) and the presence of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).\n\nThe study included 2 parts: Part 1 comprised 99 men \u2265 50 years old who underwent abdominopelvic computed tomography angiography for lower extremity claudication assessed in a retrospective cohort design; Part 2 comprised 18 patients who underwent iatrogenic IIA embolization during endovascular aneurysm repair assessed by a within-subjects approach. Prostate volume and IIA origin diameter were measured; IIA occlusion was noted. Chart review documented body mass index, LUTS, impotence, and buttock claudication.\n\nOf 99 men in Part 1, 60 had no IIA occlusion, and 39 had IIA occlusion (17 unilateral, 22 bilateral). Prostate volume differed significantly between groups (no IIA occlusion, 27.3 mL; unilateral IIA occlusion, 20.7 mL; bilateral IIA occlusion, 17.1 mL; P = .001). Men without IIA occlusion had more LUTS (27%) than men with IIA occlusion (10%; P = .04). The number of men with complaints of impotence or buttock claudication was similar in both groups (40% vs 46%; P > .05). Multiple regression showed that age and IIA occlusion were independent predictors of PV (P < 0.05), whereas body mass index was not (P > .05), and that IIA occlusion was the only independent predictor of LUTS/BPH (P < .05). Among the 18 men in Part 2, PV declined by 29% after embolization (P = .00001); 6 men had improvement or resolution of LUTS.",
        "Previous evidence on endocrine risk markers for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been inconclusive. Here, we report results of the first prospective study to investigate whether long-term hair cortisol levels and experimentally-induced cortisol stress reactivity are predictive of the development of PTSD symptomatology in response to trauma during military deployment.\n\nMale soldiers were examined before deployment to Afghanistan and at a 12-month post-deployment follow-up using dimensional measures for psychopathological symptoms. The predictive value of baseline (i) hair cortisol concentrations (HCC, N=90) and (ii) salivary cortisol stress reactivity (measured by the Trier Social Stress Test, N=80) for the development of PTSD symptomatology after being exposed to new-onset traumatic events was analyzed.\n\nBaseline cortisol activity significantly predicted PTSD symptom change from baseline to follow-up upon trauma exposure. Specifically, our results consistently revealed that lower HCC and lower cortisol stress reactivity were predictive of a greater increase in PTSD symptomatology in soldiers who had experienced new-onset traumatic events (explaining 5% and 10.3% of variance, respectively). Longitudinal analyses revealed an increase in HCC from baseline to follow-up and a trend for a negative relationship between HCC changes and the number of new-onset traumatic events. Additional pre-deployment analyses revealed that trauma history was reflected in lower HCC (at trend level) and that HCC were negatively related to stressful load.",
        "Dendritic cells are common in inflammatory processes and in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Previous studies of the predictive value of S100-positive dendritic cell density for PTC outcome yielded inconsistent results. This study investigated the association of dendritic cell density and PTC recurrence based on CD1a expression.\n\nRepresentative slides from 56 consecutive specimens of PTC were immunostained with anti-CD1a antibodies, and dendritic cell density was analyzed by disease-free survival.\n\nDendritic cells were abundant in the tumoral tissue and sparse in the normal peritumoral tissue. Peritumoral dendritic cell density >1.1 cells/HPF was inversely associated with the risk of recurrence. Similar results were obtained with tumoral dendritic cell density (>12 cells/HPF), although the statistical significance was marginal.",
        "Tissue repair that occurs after microfracture does not include hyaline-like cartilage. Therefore, other treatment modalities must be combined with microfracture to improve repair tissue quality. In this study, we combined exogenous hyaluronic acid with microfracture.\n\nThirty mature New Zealand rabbits were randomly divided into 3 groups as control, microfracture (MF), and microfracture and hyaluronic acid (MFHA). Four-millimetre full-thickness cartilage defects were created in the medial femoral condyle of each rabbit. Microfracture was performed on defects in the MF and MFHA groups. At 1 week following surgery, 1 mL of saline was injected into the knees of the control and MF groups, whereas 1 mL (15 mg/mL) hyaluronic acid was injected into the knees of the MFHA group 3 times weekly. At 6 months postsurgery, defects were evaluated according to the ICRS (International Cartilage Repair Society) and Wakitani scales.\n\nAccording to the ICRS and Wakitani scales, the quality of repair tissue was improved in MF and MFHA groups as compared the control group (P = 0.001 and 0.001, respectively). No significant difference was observed between the MF and MFHA groups (P = 0.342).",
        "To identify the underlying genetic cause in a consanguineous Chinese family segregating distal hereditary motor neuropathy (dHMN) in an autosomal recessive pattern.\n\nWe used whole-exome sequencing and homozygosity mapping to detect the genetic variant in 2 affected individuals of the consanguineous Chinese family with dHMN. RNA analysis of peripheral blood leukocytes and immunofluorescence and immunoblotting of stable cell lines were performed to support the pathogenicity of the identified mutation.\n\nWe identified 3 shared novel homozygous variants in 3 shared homozygous regions of the affected individuals. Sequencing of these 3 variants in family members revealed the c.151+1G>T mutation in SIGMAR1 gene, which located in homozygous region spanning approximately 5.3 Mb at chromosome 9p13.1-p13.3, segregated with the dHMN phenotype. The mutation causes an alternative splicing event and generates a transcript variant with an in-frame deletion of 60 base pairs in exon 1 (c.92_151del), and results in an internally shortened protein \u03c31R(31_50del). The proteasomal inhibitor treatment increased the intracellular amount of \u03c31R(31_50del) and led to the formation of nuclear aggregates. Stable expressing \u03c31R(31_50del) induced endoplasmic reticulum stress and enhanced apoptosis.",
        "Interindividual epigenetic variation that occurs systemically must be established prior to gastrulation in the very early embryo and, because it is systemic, can be assessed in easily biopsiable tissues. We employ two independent genome-wide approaches to search for such variants.\n\nFirst, we screen for metastable epialleles by performing genomewide bisulfite sequencing in peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBL) and hair follicle DNA from two Caucasian adults. Second, we conduct a genomewide screen for genomic regions at which PBL DNA methylation is affected by season of conception in rural Gambia. Remarkably, both approaches identify the genomically imprinted VTRNA2-1 as a top environmentally responsive epiallele. We demonstrate systemic and stochastic interindividual variation in DNA methylation at the VTRNA2-1 differentially methylated region in healthy Caucasian and Asian adults and show, in rural Gambians, that periconceptional environment affects offspring VTRNA2-1 epigenotype, which is stable over at least 10 years. This unbiased screen also identifies over 100 additional candidate metastable epialleles, and shows that these are associated with cis genomic features including transposable elements.",
        "Caveats in the understanding of ribavirin (RBV) mechanisms of action has somehow prevented the development of better analogues able to further improve its therapeutic contribution in interferon (IFN)-based and direct antiviral agent-based regimens for chronic HCV or other indications. Here, we describe a new mechanism by which RBV modulates IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and contributes to restore hepatic immune responsiveness.\n\nRBV effect on ISG expression was monitored in vitro and in vivo, that is, in non-transformed hepatocytes and in the liver of RBV mono-treated patients, respectively. Modulation of histone modifications and recruitment of histone-modifying enzymes at target promoters was analysed by chromatin immunoprecipitation in RBV-treated primary human hepatocytes and in patients\" liver biopsies.\n\nRBV decreases the mRNA levels of several abnormally preactivated ISGs in patients with HCV, who are non-responders to IFN therapy. RBV increases G9a histone methyltransferase recruitment and histone-H3 lysine-9 dimethylation/trimethylation at selected ISG promoters in vitro and in vivo. G9a pharmacological blockade abolishes RBV-induced ISG downregulation and severely impairs RBV ability to potentiate IFN antiviral action and induction of ISGs following HCV infection of primary human hepatocytes.",
        "To investigate whether trends of TV exposure from age six to 18\\xa0months and adult TV programmes were associated with behavioural concerns of 18-month-old Thai toddlers.\n\nThere were 194 healthy infants recruited at age six months and followed up until 18\\xa0months of age in this present cohort. TV exposure variables were assessed by interviewing in depth at both six- and 18-month-old visits. A mother of each participant rated the child\"s behaviours using the Child Behaviour Checklist.\n\nInfants who were increasingly exposed to TV from age six to 18\\xa0months with adult programmes since six months of age had higher pervasive developmental problems and oppositional defiant behaviours scores. Exposure to adult TV programmes at age six months was also associated with emotionally reactive problems, aggression and externalising behaviours in the final regression models.",
        "Photoreceptor degeneration (PRD) is a genetically heterogeneous retinal disorder. Although a number of genes involved in PRD have been identified, their genetic basis remains unknown in a significant number of patients. In this study, we aimed to identify novel disease-causing genes of PRD.\n\nComprehensive ocular examinations were performed in a 2-year-old patient diagnosed with early onset PRD. Retinal capture sequencing was performed to screen causative mutations in known retinal disease-causing loci. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) and a series of variant-filtering strategies were applied for identifying novel disease-causing genes. Retina ATF6 expression was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. RT-PCR was performed to identify ATF6 mRNA in the patient.\n\nThe patient showed typical PRD features, with macular involvement and ellipsoid zone irregularities. Results of retinal capture sequencing were negative. WES data led to identification of biallelic loss-of-function mutations in the ATF6 gene. The first variant generates a premature stop codon (NCBI accession no. NM_007348: c.1126C>T, p.R376*) and the second variant affects a splicing donor site (NM_007348: c.1533+1G>C). Sanger sequencing confirmed the 2 alleles are from 1 parent each. Both of the variants are extremely rare in the population. The splicing variant causes either intron inclusion or exon skipping in the patient, thus severely disrupting ATF6 functional domains. ATF6 is expressed in three neuronal cell layers of mouse retina.",
        "To improve the image quality of skipped phase encoding and edge deghosting (SPEED) by exploiting several sparsifying transforms.\n\nThe SPEED technique uses a skipped phase encoding (PE) step to accelerate MRI scan. Previously, a difference transform (DT) along PE direction is used to obtain sparse ghosted-edge maps, which were modeled by a double layer ghost model and was then deghosted by a least square error solution. In this work, it is hypothesized that enhanced sparsity, and thus improved image quality may be achievable with other sparsifying transforms, including discrete wavelet transform (DWT), discrete cosine transform (DCT), DWT combined with DT, and DCT combined with DT.\n\nFor images of human subjects, SPEED with DWT or DCT can yield higher image quality than DT only, especially for those images with low contrast. Reconstruction error can be further reduced if DWT or DCT are combined with DT.",
        "Bronchiolitis, the most common indication for hospitalization of young children, is associated with subsequent asthma. Blood eosinophilia is associated with increased severity of asthma, but it is unclear if eosinophilia is associated with severity of illness in bronchiolitis. We hypothesized that blood eosinophilia is associated with unfavorable short-term outcomes of bronchiolitis hospitalizations.\n\nData from initial bronchiolitis admissions to our institution between 2010 and 2013 were extracted using Population Explorer software (Explorys, Cleveland, OH). Children were categorized as \"CBC-none\" (no complete blood count [CBC] data during the first 7 days of hospitalization), EOS-positive (at least one CBC with \u2265300 eosinophils per microliter or \u22653% of all leukocytes identified as eosinophils) or EOS-negative (at least one CBC and no eosinophilia). The association between hospitalization duration and maximum absolute eosinophil count (AEC) was analyzed using Spearman correlation. Variables independently associated with prolonged (\u226572\\u2009hr) hospitalization were identified using stepwise multivariate logistic regression.\n\nIn 1356 inpatients <24 months with bronchiolitis, median hospitalization duration was 2.46 days and 38.0% had prolonged hospitalization. CBC data were available in 32.4% of subjects: 20.7% were EOS-positive and 79.3% were EOS-negative. Increased maximum AEC was significantly associated with longer duration of hospitalization. Prolonged hospitalization was independently associated with EOS-positive versus EOS-negative children (OR 1.88, 95%CI: 1.12-3.17, P\\u2009=\\u20090.020). Mechanical ventilation was most common in EOS-positive subjects (24.2% of cases), versus EOS-negative (7.2%) and CBC-none (0.7%) (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001).",

        "Multifunctional calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) is activated by angiotensin II (Ang II) in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), but its function in experimental hypertension has not been explored. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of CaMKII inhibition selectively in VSMCs on Ang II hypertension.\n\nTransgenic expression of a CaMKII peptide inhibitor in VSMCs (TG SM-CaMKIIN model) reduced the blood pressure response to chronic Ang II infusion. The aortic depressor nerve activity was reset in hypertensive versus normotensive wild-type animals but not in TG SM-CaMKIIN mice, suggesting that changes in baroreceptor activity account for the blood pressure difference between genotypes. Accordingly, aortic pulse wave velocity, a measure of arterial wall stiffness and a determinant of baroreceptor activity, increased in hypertensive versus normotensive wild-type animals but did not change in TG SM-CaMKIIN mice. Moreover, examination of blood pressure and heart rate under ganglionic blockade revealed that VSMC CaMKII inhibition abolished the augmented efferent sympathetic outflow and renal and splanchnic nerve activity in Ang II hypertension. Consequently, we hypothesized that VSMC CaMKII controls baroreceptor activity by modifying arterial wall remodeling in Ang II hypertension. Gene expression analysis in aortas from normotensive and Ang II-infused mice revealed that TG SM-CaMKIIN aortas were protected from Ang II-induced upregulation of genes that control extracellular matrix production, including collagen. VSMC CaMKII inhibition also strongly altered the expression of muscle contractile genes under Ang II.",
        "This study was aimed at investigating whether the \u03b22 -adrenoceptor agonist, salbutamol, could modulate RhoA activation in normal and homologously desensitized bronchial smooth muscle cells (BSMC).\n\nSerum-starved BSMCs were stimulated with the Rho-activating compound calpeptin in the presence or absence of salbutamol, the Epac activator, 8-pCPT-2\"-O-Me-cAMP, or the site-selective activator of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), 6-Bnz-cAMP. Activated RhoA was assessed by immunocytochemical detection and by RhoA G-LISA assay.\n\nStimulation with calpeptin caused translocation of RhoA from cytosol to plasma membrane, a condition required for the functional coupling of RhoA with its cellular targets. Pretreatment with salbutamol 10\\u2009\u03bcm for 15\\u2009min was found to block calpeptin-induced activation of RhoA in normal, but not in homologously desensitized cells. Pretreatment of calpeptin-stimulated BSMC with 8-pCPT-2\"-O-Me-cAMP or 6-Bnz-cAMP could reproduce the effect of salbutamol.",
        "Src homology 2 (SH2) B adaptor protein 1 (SH2B1) is expressed in various tissues, including the heart. Previous studies have demonstrated that SH2B1 is involved in a variety of biological process, such as maintaining neuronal differentiation, regulating energy and glucose homeostasis, and promoting cell proliferation and motility. However, the role of SH2B1 in cardiac hypertrophy remains unclear. This study aimed at identifying the effects and the underlying mechanisms of SH2B1 in cardiac hypertrophy.\n\nWe performed gain- and loss-of-function studies using genetic approaches, and cardiac hypertrophy was evaluated through pathological, echocardiographic, haemodynamic, and molecular analyses. We found that SH2B1 expression was significantly increased in both failing human hearts and hypertrophic murine hearts. Mice overexpressing SH2B1 specifically in the heart displayed increased aortic banding (AB)-induced cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, ventricular dilation, and dysfunction compared with controls, whereas loss of SH2B1 produced the opposite phenotype. Consistently, similar results were observed in a global SH2B1-knockout rat model. Mechanistically, the pro-hypertrophic effects elicited by SH2B1 were associated with activation of the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signalling cascade. Furthermore, rescue experiments revealed that pharmacological inactivation of JAK2 rescued pressure overload-induced cardiac abnormalities in transgenic mice with cardiac-specific SH2B1 overexpression.",
        "The genetic basis of leaf shape has long interested botanists because leaf shape varies extensively across the plant kingdom and this variation is probably adaptive. However, knowledge of the genetic architecture of leaf shape variation in natural populations remains limited. This study examined the genetic architecture of leaf shape diversification among three edaphic specialists in the Mimulus guttatus species complex. Lobed and narrow leaves have evolved from the entire, round leaves of M. guttatus in M. laciniatus, M. nudatus and a polymorphic serpentine M. guttatus population (M2L).\n\nBulk segregant analysis and next-generation sequencing were used to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that underlie leaf shape in an M. laciniatus\\u2009\u00d7\\u2009M. guttatus F2 population. To determine whether the same QTLs contribute to leaf shape variation in M. nudatus and M2L, F2s from M. guttatus\\u2009\u00d7\\u2009M. nudatus and lobed M2L\\u2009\u00d7\\u2009unlobed M. guttatus crosses were genotyped at QTLs from the bulk segregant analysis.\n\nNarrow and lobed leaf shapes in M. laciniatus, M. nudatus and M. guttatus are controlled by overlapping genetic regions. Several promising leaf shape candidate genes were found under each QTL.",
        "Cadmium (Cd) is a non-essential trace element that elicits oxidative stress. Plants respond to Cd toxicity via increasing their Cd-chelating and antioxidative capacities. They predominantly chelate Cd via glutathione (GSH) and phytochelatins (PCs), while antioxidative defence is mainly based on the use and recycling of both GSH and ascorbate (AsA), complemented by superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). In addition, both metabolites act as a substrate for the regeneration of other essential antioxidants, which neutralize and regulate reactive oxygen species (ROS). Together, these functions influence the concentration and cellular redox state of GSH and AsA. In this study, these two parameters were examined in plants of Arabidopsis thaliana exposed to sub-lethal Cd concentrations.\n\nWild-type plants and mutant arabidopsis plants containing 30-45\\xa0% of wild-type levels of GSH (cad2-1) or 40-50\\xa0% of AsA (vtc1-1), together with the double-mutant (cad2-1 vtc1-1) were cultivated in a hydroponic system and exposed to sub-lethal Cd concentrations. Cadmium detoxification was investigated at different levels including gene expression and metabolite concentrations.\n\nIn comparison with wild-type plants, elevated basal thiol levels and enhanced PC synthesis upon exposure to Cd efficiently compensated AsA deficiency in vtc1-1 plants and contributed to decreased sensitivity towards Cd. Glutathione-deficient (cad2-1 and cad2-1 vtc1-1) mutants, however, showed a more oxidized GSH redox state, resulting in initial oxidative stress and a higher sensitivity to Cd. In order to cope with the Cd stress to which they were exposed, GSH-deficient mutants activated multiple alternative pathways.",
        "Hypotension is the most common complication after subarachnoid anesthesia for cesarean delivery. Several therapeutic and preventive measures are used to attenuate this side effect. Serotonin receptor-blocking drugs have been suggested as one such approach. We sought to determine whether prophylactically administered intravenous ondansetron could attenuate hypotension in patients undergoing elective cesarean delivery performed under subarachnoid anesthesia.\n\nEighty-six patients undergoing elective cesarean delivery were recruited and randomly allocated to receive either 8 mg intravenous ondansetron (group O; n = 44) or placebo (group P; n = 42) in a prospective double-blind design. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and heart rate (HR) were measured at baseline and at 3-minute intervals from the time of initiation of subarachnoid anesthesia until delivery. Ondansetron effect on hemodynamics (SBP, DBP, MAP, and HR) was quantified and analyzed using a linear mixed effect model.\n\nWe did not find differences in SBP (P = 0.78), MAP (P = 0.89), DBP (P = 0.82), or HR (P = 0.18) between the 2 groups during the study period. Phenylephrine requirements to treat hypotension were 350 \u03bcg (175-700 \u03bcg) in group O and 450 \u03bcg (300-700 \u03bcg) in group P (P = 0.30). The incidence of pruritus was 63% (n = 28 of 44) in group O and 56% (n = 23 of 42) in group P (difference, 0.08 [95% confidence interval, -0.23 to 0.41], P = 0.59). No difference in the incidence of nausea and vomiting or sensory level was found.",
        "The transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block can be used as part of a multimodal analgesia protocol after abdominal surgery. This study investigated whether a pneumoperitoneum during abdominal surgery influences the spread of local anesthetics.\n\nNine fresh frozen cadavers were used for the study. Using an ultrasound-guided midaxillary technique, a unilateral TAP block-like injection with 20 mL of methylene blue dye was performed. After the injection, a pneumoperitoneum was immediately installed for 1 hour. After desufflation, this ipsilateral side was dissected, and a TAP block-like injection was performed on the contralateral side. One hour after injection, the contralateral side was also dissected. The anatomical dissection was used to determine the extent of dye spread and the nerves stained by the dye.\n\nIn none of the specimens did the dye reach the posterior origin of the transverse abdominal muscle. There was no statistically significant difference in the number of stained nerves and spread of the dye in the insufflated side compared with the noninsufflated side. In 4 of 9 cadavers, we found a variant course of a nerve preventing staining of that nerve.",
        "The homologous coagulation factor X (FX), VII (FVII), IX (FIX) and protein C (PC) display striking differences in the carboxyl-terminus, with that of FX being the most extended. This region is essential for FVII, FIX and PC secretion.\n\nTo provide experimental evidence for the role of the FX carboxyl-terminus.\n\nRecombinant FX (rFX) variants were expressed in multiple eukaryotic cell systems. Protein and activity levels were evaluated by ELISA, coagulant and amidolytic assays.",
        "Transposable elements are mobile DNA sequences that are widely distributed in prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes, where they represent a major force in genome evolution. However, transposable elements have rarely been documented in viruses, and their contribution to viral genome evolution remains largely unexplored. Pandoraviruses are recently described DNA viruses with genome sizes that exceed those of some prokaryotes, rivaling parasitic eukaryotes. These large genomes appear to include substantial noncoding intergenic spaces, which provide potential locations for transposable element insertions. However, no mobile genetic elements have yet been reported in pandoravirus genomes.\n\nHere, we report a family of miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) in the Pandoravirus salinus genome, representing the first description of a virus populated with a canonical transposable element family that proliferated by transposition within the viral genome. The MITE family, which we name Submariner, includes 30 copies with all the hallmarks of MITEs: short length, terminal inverted repeats, TA target site duplication, and no coding capacity. Submariner elements show signs of transposition and are undetectable in the genome of Pandoravirus dulcis, the closest known relative Pandoravirus salinus. We identified a DNA transposon related to Submariner in the genome of Acanthamoeba castellanii, a species thought to host pandoraviruses, which contains remnants of coding sequence for a Tc1/mariner transposase. These observations suggest that the Submariner MITEs of P. salinus belong to the widespread Tc1/mariner superfamily and may have been mobilized by an amoebozoan host. Ten of the 30 MITEs in the P. salinus genome are located within coding regions of predicted genes, while others are close to genes, suggesting that these transposons may have contributed to viral genetic novelty.",
        "Sleep problems and substance use are strongly linked. Sleep problems play a role in the etiology of substance use, but also may be a result of it. After detoxification, sleep problems may worsen leading to relapse. Nowadays, most substance dependence treatment programs aim at recovery rather than total abstinence, and in that view health-related quality of life (HRQL) is a relevant construct. This article describes the association between self-perceived sleep problems and HRQL in a naturalistic population of polydrug-using inpatients.\n\nAt the start of treatment, 388 polydrug-using inpatients completed questionnaires concerning their sleep quality and HRQL. Three categories were established based on reported sleep problems: patients without sleep problems (21.6%), those with clinically relevant sleep problems (34.5%), and patients with sleep disorders (43.8%).\n\nMean grades for quality of sleep were M\\u2009=\\u20097.3 (sd 1.7), M\\u2009=\\u20096.6 (sd 1.7) and M\\u2009=\\u20095.3 (sd 1.9) for the three categories, respectively. In addition, patients in the disorder category perceived a lower HRQL than those in the other categories. In the explanation of HRQL, both sleep problems and sleep disorders added significantly to the model when controlling for baseline characteristics.",
        "The aim was to assess the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and tolerability of octreotide subcutaneous (s.c.) depot, a novel octreotide formulation.\n\nThis was a phase I, randomized, open label study. After a single dose of octreotide immediate release (IR) 200 \u00b5g, subjects were randomized to one of eight groups to receive three monthly injections of octreotide s.c. depot A 10, 20 or 30 mg, B 30 mg, C 10, 20 or 30 mg or long acting octreotide (octreotide LAR) 30 mg.\n\nOne hundred and twenty-two subjects were randomized. For all depot variants, onset of octreotide release was rapid and sustained for up to 4 weeks. The relative octreotide bioavailability of depot variants vs. octreotide IR ranged from 0.68 (90% confidence interval [CI] 0.61, 0.76) to 0.91 (90% CI 0.81, 1.02) and, vs. octreotide LAR, was approximately four- to five-fold greater: 3.97 (90% CI 3.35, 4.71) to 5.27 ng ml(-1) h (90% CI 4.43, 6.27). All depot variants showed relatively rapid initial reductions of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) compared with octreotide LAR. A trend of octreotide dose dependence was also indicated from the plasma concentrations and suppression of IGF-1. Maximum inhibition of IGF-1 at steady-state was highest for depot B and C. All depot treatments were well tolerated. The most frequent adverse events were gastrointestinal related.",
        "The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that preoperative prostate health index (PHI) levels could help to predict early biochemical recurrence (BCR) in a contemporary population of patients with prostate cancer treated with robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).\n\nThe study population consisted of 313 patients treated with RARP for clinically localized prostate cancer at a single institution between 2010 and 2011. Patients subjected to neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapies and patients with a follow-up of<2 years were excluded. BCR was defined as a postoperative level of total prostate-specific antigen \u22650.2 ng/ml and elevating after RARP. The minimum P-value method was used to determine the most significant PHI cutoff value to discriminate between patients with and without BCR. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to determine BCR-free survival rates. Finally, Cox regression models were fitted to determine the predictors of BCR, and the predictive accuracy (area under the curve) of each predictor was determined with the Harrell concordance index.\n\nMean total prostate-specific antigen and mean PHI levels were 5.76 ng/ml (interquartile range: 4.2-8.7) and 46.0 (35-62), respectively. Biopsy Gleason score was 6 in 173 (55.3%), 7 in 121 (38.7%), and \u22658 in 19 (6.1%) patients. At final pathology, extracapsular extension was observed in 59 (18.8%), seminal vesicle invasion in 24 (7.7%), and lymph node invasion in 11 (3.5%) patients, whereas 228 (72.8%) patients had organ-confined disease. The 2-year BCR-free survival rate was 92.5% in the overall population and was 96.7% in patients with organ-confined disease. The most significant PHI cutoff value to discriminate between patients with and without BCR was 82. Specifically, the 2-year BCR-free survival rate was 97.7% in patients with a preoperative PHI level<82 relative to 69.7% in patients with a PHI level \u226582 (log-rank test: P<0.001). Finally, in multivariable Cox regression analyses, PHI level emerged as an independent predictor of BCR in both the preoperative and the postoperative settings and was more accurate than several established BCR predictors were.",
        "Mothers\" knowledge of neonatal jaundice (NNJ) is grossly deficient or inaccurate, which may adversely affect the actions of mothers in the recognition of NNJ and cause a delay in seeking medical attention.\n\nA total of 1036 primiparas were separated randomly into the intervention group and the control group, with 518 primiparas in each group.\n\nAll (100%) mothers in the intervention group understood that NNJ is a yellow discoloration of the skin and sclera; 94.19% of them considered that NNJ is a common problem in newborns; 82.80% and 95.27% replied that jaundice appearing within the first 36 hours and lasting more than 2 weeks usually indicates pathological NNJ; 96.34%, 80.86%, and 90.32% realized that premature newborns, low birth weight, and perinatal asphyxia, respectively, are more likely to be accompanied by NNJ; 97.41%, 78.71%, and 64.95% knew that maternal-fetal blood group incompatibility, infection, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, respectively, are the common inducements to NNJ; 94.84% could associate NNJ with brain damage; 92.26%, 93.12%, and 74.62% agreed that phototherapy, strengthen feeding, and exchange blood transfusion, respectively, can greatly relieve NNJ. However, some respondents in the control group responded in other ways, such as stopping breastfeeding (9.19%), placing newborns in sunlight (10.24%) and traditional Chinese medicine (10.24%), which was significantly higher than that of the intervention group. There was also a significant delay for respondents in the control group in consulting a pediatrician, and 6.30% of them did not seek medical help until after the interview.",
        "To investigate whether the proportions of acetyl-histone-positive hepatocytes could be used as markers of deteriorating liver function.\n\nIn total, 611 cirrhotic cases from 3701 patients who were diagnosed during the past 15 years were screened, and 152 follow-up cases were selected. Paraffin tissue microarray was prepared for immunohistochemistry to examine acetyl-histone expression. The proportions of positive hepatocytes were recorded, and their correlations to clinical and laboratory indicators were analyzed statistically.\n\nThe proportions of H2AK5ac(+), H3K9/K14ac(+) and H3K27ac(+) hepatocytes gradually increased with deteriorating liver function and with increasing levels of serum markers of liver injury. In the follow-up cases, patients with > 70% H2AK5ac(+), H3K9/K14ac(+) or H3K27ac(+) hepatocytes had statistically lower survival rates (P < 0.05). Furthermore, > 70% H2AK5ac(+) or H3K27ac(+) hepatocytes were strong independent predictors of overall survival (P < 0.05).",
        "To analyze RASSF6 expression in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and to determine whether RASSF6 has an independent prognostic value in PDAC.\n\nWe studied RASSF6 expression in 96 histologically confirmed PDAC samples and 20 chronic pancreatitis specimens using immunohistochemistry and real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. PDAC issues were then classified as RASSF6 strongly positive, weakly positive or negative. RASSF6 mRNA and protein expression in PDAC samples with strong positive staining was further evaluated using real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. Lastly, correlations between RASSF6 staining and patients\" clinicopathological variables and outcomes were assessed.\n\nRASSF6 was negatively expressed in 51 (53.1%) PDAC samples, weakly positively expressed in 29 (30.2%) and strongly positively expressed in 16 (16.7%), while its expression was much higher in para-tumor tissues and chronic pancreatitis tissues. Positive relationships between RASSF6 expression and T-stage (P = 0.047) and perineural invasion (P = 0.026) were observed. The median survival time of strongly and weakly positive and negative RASSF6 staining groups was 33 mo, 15 mo and 11 mo, respectively. Cox multivariate analysis indicated that RASSF6 was an independent prognostic indicator of overall survival in patients with PDAC. A survival curve analysis revealed that increased RASSF6 expression was correlated with better overall survival (P = 0.009).",
        "Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) is an important marker of tumor-initiating cells. We aimed to investigate ALDH1 expression in benign breast disease and human breast cancer of different histologic stages.\n\nImmunohistochemical staining of ALDH1 was applied to 21 cases with benign breast diseases, 47 ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) cases, 62 cases diagnosed with invasive cancer with extensive intraductal component (EIC), and 58 cases diagnosed with invasive cancer without EIC.\n\nALDH1 was expressed in tumor cells in 61.0% of 164 breast cancer cases, which was higher than that in benign breast disease (3/21) (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Of these 167 breast cancer cases, a significantly higher rate (54/58) of intratumoral ALDH1 expression was observed in invasive cancer without EIC cases than that in DCIS cases (19/46, one case not available) and invasive cancer with EIC cases (27/60, two cases not available) (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001).

In 47 DCIS cases, no significant association was observed between ALDH1 positivity and any clinicopathological parameter (all P\\u2009>\\u20090.05). However, ALDH1 positive invasive breast cancers were significantly more likely to be with large tumor size (P\\u2009=\\u20090.001), high grade (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001), and high Ki67 expression (P\\u2009=\\u20090.009).",
        "Tight glucose control (TGC) reduces morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery, but only limited data about its optimal timing are available to date.\n\nThe purpose of this article was to compare the effects of perioperative vs postoperative initiation of TGC on postoperative adverse events in cardiac surgery patients.\n\nThis was a single center, single-blind, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial.\n\nThe setting was an academic tertiary hospital.\n\nParticipants were 2383 hemodynamically stable patients undergoing major cardiac surgery with expected postoperative intensive care unit treatment for at least 2 consecutive days.\n\nIntensive insulin therapy was initiated perioperatively or postoperatively with a target glucose range of 4.4 to 6.1 mmol/L.\n\nAdverse events from any cause during postoperative hospital stay were compared.\n\nIn the whole cohort, perioperatively initiated TGC markedly reduced the number of postoperative complications (23.2% vs 34.1%, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60-0.78) despite only minimal improvement in glucose control (blood glucose, 6.6 \u00b1 0.7 vs 6.7 \u00b1 0.8 mmol/L, P < .001; time in target range, 39.3% \u00b1 13.7% vs 37.3% \u00b1 13.8%, P < .001). The positive effects of TGC on postoperative complications were driven by nondiabetic subjects (21.3% vs 33.7%, 95% CI, 0.54-0.74; blood glucose 6.5 \u00b1 0.6 vs 6.6 \u00b1 0.8 mmol/L, not significant; time in target range, 40.8% \u00b1 13.6% vs 39.7% \u00b1 13.8%, not significant), whereas no significant effect was seen in diabetic patients (29.4% vs 35.1%, 95% CI, 0.66-1.06) despite significantly better glucose control in the perioperative group (blood glucose, 6.9 \u00b1 1.0 vs 7.1 \u00b1 0.8 mmol/L, P < .001; time in target range, 34.3% \u00b1 12.7% vs 30.8% \u00b1 11.5%, P < .001).",
        "Protein tyrosine kinase 6 (PTK6) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that is highly expressed in Human Epidermal Growth Factor 2(+) (Her2(+)) breast cancers. Overexpression of PTK6 enhances anchorage-independent survival, proliferation, and migration of breast cancer cells. We hypothesized that PTK6 inhibition is an effective strategy to inhibit growth and survival of Her2(+) breast cancer cells, including those that are relatively resistant to Lapatinib, a targeted therapy for Her2(+) breast cancer, either intrinsically or acquired after continuous drug exposure.\n\nTo determine the effects of PTK6 inhibition on Lapatinib-resistant Her2(+) breast cancer cell lines (UACC893R1 and MDA-MB-453), we used short hairpin ribonucleic acid (shRNA) vectors to downregulate PTK6 expression. We determined the effects of PTK6 downregulation on growth and survival in vitro and in vivo, as well as the mechanisms responsible for these effects.\n\nLapatinib treatment of \"sensitive\" Her2(+) cells induces apoptotic cell death and enhances transcript and protein levels of Bim, a pro-apoptotic Bcl2 family member. In contrast, treatment of relatively \"resistant\" Her2(+) cells fails to induce Bim or enhance levels of cleaved, poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP). Downregulation of PTK6 expression in these \"resistant\" cells enhances Bim expression, resulting in apoptotic cell death. PTK6 downregulation impairs growth of these cells in in vitro 3-D Matrigel(TM) cultures, and also inhibits growth of Her2(+) primary tumor xenografts. Bim expression is critical for apoptosis induced by PTK6 downregulation, as co-expression of Bim shRNA rescued these cells from PTK6 shRNA-induced death. The regulation of Bim by PTK6 is not via changes in Erk/MAPK or Akt signaling, two pathways known to regulate Bim expression. Rather, PTK6 downregulation activates p38, and pharmacological inhibition of p38 activity prevents PTK6 shRNA-induced Bim expression and partially rescues cells from apoptosis.",
        "Little evidence exists on change in diet quality and weight change.\n\nWe examined the association between change of diet quality indexes and concurrent weight change over 20 y.\n\nIn this analysis we followed 50,603 women in the Nurses\" Health Study (NHS), 22,973 men in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS) between 1986 and 2006, and 72,495 younger women from the Nurses\" Health Study II (NHS II) between 1989 and 2007. Diet was measured every 4 y. We computed the Alternate Mediterranean Diet, the Alternate Health Eating Index-2010 (AHEI-2010), and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension adherence scores for each participant. All scores emphasize fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and nuts, but they differ in score range and components such as dairy, sodium, and sweetened beverages. Regression models were used to examine 4-y changes in these scores and weight change within the same period, adjusting for lifestyle factors.\n\nMean age at baseline was 49.4 y for NHS, 48.0 y for HPFS, and 36.3 y for NHS II. Baseline BMI (in kg/m(2)) was similar (23.7 for NHS, 24.7 for HPFS, and 23.0 for NHS II). We observed significantly less weight gain over 4-y periods with each SD increase of each diet quality score in both men and women. Results were significantly stronger in the younger cohort (NHS II) than in the older cohorts (e.g., -0.67 kg less weight gain in NHS II vs. -0.39 kg in NHS for each SD increase in AHEI-2010; P-heterogeneity: <0.001). Improvement of any of the diet scores benefited overweight (-0.27 to -1.08 kg less weight gain for each SD increase in score) more than normal-weight individuals (-0.10 to -0.40 kg; P-interaction: <0.001).",
        "Preterm birth is one of the leading causes of neonatal morbidity in the United States. Despite decades of research, the etiology is largely unknown.\n\nThe purpose of our study was to examine the association between maternal dietary patterns during pregnancy and preterm birth.\n\nThis prospective cohort study used data from the PIN (Pregnancy, Infection, and Nutrition) study (n = 3143). Dietary intake was assessed at 26-29 wk of gestation by using a food-frequency questionnaire, and patterns were derived by using factor analysis and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. Associations between dietary patterns and preterm birth were assessed by logistic regression.\n\nFour dietary patterns were identified from the factor analysis characterized by high intakes of the following: 1) fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy, high-fiber and fortified cereals, nonfried chicken and fish, and wheat bread; 2) beans, corn, French fries, hamburgers or cheeseburgers, white potatoes, fried chicken, mixed dishes, and ice cream; 3) collard greens, coleslaw or cabbage, red and processed meats, cornbread or hushpuppies, whole milk, and vitamin C-rich drinks; and 4) shellfish, pizza, salty snacks, and refined grains. Increased odds of preterm birth were found for a diet characterized by a high consumption of collard greens, coleslaw or cabbage, red meats, fried chicken and fish, processed meats, cornbread or hushpuppies, eggs or egg biscuits, gravy, whole milk, and vitamin C-rich drinks such as Kool-Aid (Kraft Foods) and Hi-C (Minute Maid Co.) (adjusted OR for quartile 4 vs. quartile 1: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.07, 2.24).

        "In utero exposure to excessive cholesterol has been shown to increase fetal plasma cholesterol concentration and predispose adult offspring to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Because lipid-lowering drugs are contraindicated during pregnancy, natural cholesterol-lowering compounds may be a safe and effective alternative to reduce CVD risk in offspring born to hypercholesterolemic mothers.\n\nThis study used the hypercholesterolemic apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE(-/-)) mouse model to test the hypothesis that mothers supplemented with phytosterols during gestation and lactation would produce offspring with a more favorable lipid profile than offspring from unsupplemented mothers, despite having a genetic predisposition toward hypercholesterolemia.\n\nSixteen female apoE(-/-) mice were randomly assigned to 2 diets fed throughout the gestation and lactation periods: a cholesterol-enriched diet (CH) (0.15%) or the cholesterol-enriched diet supplemented with phytosterols (CH/PS) (2%). Serum lipids and lipoproteins were measured by enzyme assay and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, respectively, and liver cholesterol was analyzed by GC.\n\nCompared with the CH-fed dams at the end of lactation, phytosterol-supplemented dams displayed lower (P < 0.05) serum total cholesterol (-55%), non-HDL cholesterol (-56%), and LDL cholesterol (-47%), but no change (P > 0.05) in HDL cholesterol and triacylglycerol (TG) concentrations. Pups from phytosterol-fed dams demonstrated lower (P < 0.05) total cholesterol (-25%), non-HDL cholesterol (-25%), LDL cholesterol (-47%), and TGs (-41%), without any change (P > 0.05) in HDL cholesterol compared with pups from CH-fed dams.

Plasma 25(OH)D concentrations were assessed from blood samples and categorized as <25 nmol/L (deficiency), 25-49 nmol/L (insufficiency), or \u226550 nmol/L (sufficiency). AMD was classified as: no AMD, early AMD, and late AMD. Associations between baseline characteristics and plasma 25(OH)D status were examined with multinomial logistic regression analysis. Associations between AMD and plasma 25(OH)D status were estimated using generalized estimating equation logistic regressions.\n\nSix hundred ninety-seven subjects with complete data were included. The prevalence of plasma 25(OH)D deficiency and insufficiency were 27.3% and 55.9%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, 25(OH)D deficiency was significantly associated with older age (P = 0.0007), females (P = 0.0007), absence of physical activity (P = 0.01), absence of vitamin D supplementation (P < 0.0001), higher plasma total cholesterol (P = 0.007), use of fibrates (P < 0.0001), lower alcohol consumption (P = 0.02), and season of blood sampling (P < 0.0001).

        "Infections caused by strains with multi-drug resistance are difficult to treat with standard antibiotics. Garlic is a powerful remedy to protect against infections of many bacteria, fungi and viruses. However, little is known about the potentials of fresh garlic extract (FGE) to improve the sensitivity of multi-drug resistant strains to antibiotics.\n\nIn this study, we used the disk diffusion method to investigate the antimicrobial activities of FGE and the combination of antibiotics with FGE, on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans, to evaluate the interactions between antibiotics and FGE.\n\nClinical isolates were isolated from clinical specimens obtained from the inpatients at the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi\"an Jiaotong University Health Science Center. The isolates consisted of MRSA, (n = 30), C. albicans (n = 30) and P. aeruginosa (n = 30). Quality control for CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute) disk diffusion was performed using S. aureus ATCC\u00ae25923, C. albicans ATCC\u00ae90028 and P. aeruginosa ATCC\u00ae27853. The 93 microorganisms were divided into four groups in a factorial design: control (deionized water), FGE, antibiotics without FGE, and antibiotics with FGE. Next, antibacterial activity was evaluated by measuring the diameter of inhibition zones according to performance standards for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI, formerly NCCLS).\n\nFresh garlic extract displayed evident inhibition properties against C. albicans and MRSA, yet weak inhibition properties against P. aeruginosa. Additionally, FGE showed the potential to improve the effect of antibiotics on antibiotic resistant pathogens. The synergism of fluconazole and itraconazole with FGE on C. albicans yielded larger sized inhibition zones compared with fluconazole and itraconazole without FGE (P < 0.01).

        "Acid suppression medication is associated with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in adults and is increasingly prescribed to children. This study evaluated the relationship between acid suppression medication and incident CDI in children.\n\nThis was a population-based, nested case-control study. Patients were eligible if they were aged 0-17 years with 3 or more visits or 1 year or more of follow-up in the dataset. Patients were excluded if they had comorbidities that associate with CDI and might also associate with acid suppression medication. Patients with codes for CDI were matched 1:5 with control patients by age, sex, medical practice, time of entry into the dataset, and follow-up time. The primary exposure was use of acid suppression medication with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) within 8-90 days.\n\nWe identified 650 CDI cases and 3200 controls. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for CDI and acid suppression medication was 7.66 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.24-18.1). Acid suppression medication was associated with CDI in infants aged <1 year (OR, 5.24; 95% CI, 1.13-24.4) and children aged 1-17 years (OR, 9.33; 95% CI, 3.25-26.8). There was increased risk for CDI with PPIs compared with H2RAs and with recent compared with distant exposure.",
        "The advent of the NGS technologies has permitted profiling of whole-genome transcriptomes (i.e., RNA-Seq) at unprecedented speed and very low cost. RNA-Seq provides a far more precise measurement of transcript levels and their isoforms compared to other methods such as microarrays. A fundamental goal of RNA-Seq is to better identify expression changes between different biological or disease conditions. However, existing methods for detecting differential expression from RNA-Seq count data have not been comprehensively evaluated in large-scale RNA-Seq datasets. Many of them suffer from inflation of type I error and failure in controlling false discovery rate especially in the presence of abnormal high sequence read counts in RNA-Seq experiments.\n\nTo address these challenges, we propose a powerful and robust tool, termed deGPS, for detecting differential expression in RNA-Seq data. This framework contains new normalization methods based on generalized Poisson distribution modeling sequence count data, followed by permutation-based differential expression tests. We systematically evaluated our new tool in simulated datasets from several large-scale TCGA RNA-Seq projects, unbiased benchmark data from compcodeR package, and real RNA-Seq data from the development transcriptome of Drosophila. deGPS can precisely control type I error and false discovery rate for the detection of differential expression and is robust in the presence of abnormal high sequence read counts in RNA-Seq experiments.",
        "Variation in terms of outcome and toxic side effects of treatment exists among acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients on chemotherapy with cytarabine (Ara-C) and daunorubicin (Dnr). Candidate Ara-C metabolizing gene expression in primary AML cells is proposed to account for this variation.\n\nEx vivo Ara-C sensitivity was determined in primary AML samples using MTT assay. mRNA expression of candidate Ara-C metabolizing genes were evaluated by RQPCR analysis. Global gene expression profiling was carried out for identifying differentially expressed genes between exvivo Ara-C sensitive and resistant samples.\n\nWide interindividual variations in ex vivo Ara-C cytotoxicity were observed among samples from patients with AML and were stratified into sensitive, intermediately sensitive and resistant, based on IC50 values obtained by MTT assay. RNA expression of deoxycytidine kinase (DCK), human equilibrative nucleoside transporter-1 (ENT1) and ribonucleotide reductase M1 (RRM1) were significantly higher and cytidine deaminase (CDA) was significantly lower in ex vivo Ara-C sensitive samples. Higher DCK and RRM1 expression in AML patient\"s blast correlated with better DFS. Ara-C resistance index (RI), a mathematically derived quotient was proposed based on candidate gene expression pattern. Ara-C ex vivo sensitive samples were found to have significantly lower RI compared with resistant as well as samples from patients presenting with relapse. Patients with low RI supposedly highly sensitive to Ara-C were found to have higher incidence of induction death (p = 0.002; RR: 4.35 [95% CI: 1.69-11.22]). Global gene expression profiling undertaken to find out additional contributors of Ara-C resistance identified many apoptosis as well as metabolic pathway genes to be differentially expressed between Ara-C resistant and sensitive samples.",
        "To reveal the role of Dnmts in the improvement of spatial learning and memory induced by erythropoietin (EPO) in SAMP8 mice.\n\nThe Morris water maze (MWM) was used to assess spatial learning and memory. Mice were administered by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of recombinant human EPO and hippocamppi infusion (IH) of 5-aza-2\"-deoxycytidine (5-AZA). The expression of genes Dnmt1, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b in the hippocampus was detected by real-time qPCR. The level of proteins DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B was measured by Western blotting.\n\nSpatial learning and memory in SAMP8 were promoted after i.p. injection of EPO (5000IU/kg/day) and expression of Dnmt3b mRNA and DNMT3B proteins in the hippocampus increased. The improved memory by EPO was blocked after IH 5-AZA.",
        "To investigate whether serum leucine-rich \u03b12-glycoprotein (LRG) levels are elevated in patients with adult-onset Still\"s disease (AOSD) and determine their correlation with disease activity parameters.\n\nWe enrolled 39 patients with AOSD, 47 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and 39 controls. Forty-five serum samples from the patients with AOSD were assayed for LRG using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Comprehensive AOSD activity was determined by a modified Pouchot score.\n\nSerum LRG levels were significantly elevated in patients with AOSD (128.8\u00b140.8 ng/mL) compared to those in patients with RA and in controls (33.9\u00b115.2 ng/mL, p<0.001 and 22.4\u00b16.1 ng/mL, p<0.001, respectively). Patients with active AOSD had significantly higher LRG levels than those with inactive disease (141.4\u00b131.3 ng/mL vs. 79.8\u00b137.1 ng/mL, p=0.002). Serum LRG levels were positively correlated with C-reactive protein (CRP; \u03b3=0.387, p=0.015), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; \u03b3=0.370, p=0.026), ferritin (\u03b3=0.687, p<0.001) levels, and the modified Pouchot score (\u03b3=0.756, p<0.001). Serum LRG levels decreased significantly after treatment in all six patients with active AOSD who had follow-up evaluations (p=0.007). The best cut-off value for LRG to distinguish AOSD from RA was 67.9 ng/mL, with a sensitivity of 92.3% and a specificity of 97.9%.",
        "With the globalization of biomedical research and the advent of \"precision medicine,\" there is increased need for translation of neuropsychological tests, such as computerized batteries that can be incorporated in large-scale genomic studies. Estimates of translational validity are obtained by administering the test in the original and the translated versions to bilingual individuals. We investigated the translation of a neuropsychological battery from English to Arabic and how practice effects influence translational validity estimates.\n\nThe Penn computerized neurocognitive battery (Penn CNB) includes tests that were validated with functional neuroimaging and provides measures of accuracy and speed of performance in several cognitive domains. To develop an Arabic version of the CNB, the English version was translated into Arabic, then back translated and revised. The Arabic and the original English versions were administered in a randomized crossover design to bilingual participants (N = 22).\n\nPerformance varied by cognitive domain, but generally improved at the second session regardless of the language of the initial test. When performance on the English and Arabic version was compared, significant positive correlations were detected for accuracy in 8/13 cognitive domains and for speed in 4/13 domains (r = .02 to .97). When the practice estimates using linear models were incorporated, the translational validity estimates improved substantially (accuracy, r = .50-.96, speed, r = .63-.92, all correlations, p = .05 or better).",
        "Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are believed to be the \"seed cell\" in cancer recurrence and metastasis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as potential therapeutic candidates due to their ability to regulate the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of miRNA-200c (miR-200c) on the EMT, tumorigenesis, colony formation, invasion and chemoresistance of human pancreatic cancer stem cells (PCSCs).\n\nPCSCs with CD24+CD44+ESA+ as the marker was sorted from PANC-1 cell line by fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assay was used to detect the relative mRNA expression levels of miR-200c and EMT-associated phenotypes. Transfection of miR-200c mimic into PCSCs was performed to establish miR- 200c overexpressed cells. The assays of colony forming, cellular invasion and survival in vitro and tumor progression in vivo were performed.\n\nExpression of miR-200c was significantly reduced in PCSCs compared with PANC-1 cells. However, the stable over expression of the miR-200c in the PCSCs resulted in a significant down-regulation of zinc-finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) and the Vimentin expression, an upregulation of the E-cadherin expression as well as a decrease of colony forming, chemoresistance and invasion in vitro and xenograft growth in vivo in nude mice by inhibition of the EMT.",
        "Our pilot study using miRNA PCR array found that miRNA-29b (miR-29b) is differentially expressed in primary cultured CD133-positive A549 cells compared with CD133-negative A549 cells.\n\nTen human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines and samples from thirty patients with NSCLC were analyzed for the expression of miR-29b by quantitative RT-PCR. Bioinformatics analysis combined with tumor metastasis PCR array showed the potential target genes for miR-29b. miR-29b lentivirus and inhibitors were transfected into NSCLC cells to investigate its role on regulating cell proliferation which was measured by CCK-8 assay in vitro and nude mice xenograft tumor assay in vivo. Cell motility ability was evaluated by transwell assay. The target genes of miR-29b were determined by luciferase assay, quantitative RT-PCR and western blot.\n\nBioinformatics analysis combined with tumor metastasis PCR array showed that matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) and PTEN could be important target genes of miR-29b. The expression of miR-29b was down regulated in NSCLC tissues compared to the normal tissues. Clinicopathological analysis demonstrated that miR-29b had significant negative correlation with lymphatic metastasis. The gain-of-function studies revealed that ectopic expression of miR-29b decreased cell proliferation, migration and invasion abilities of NSCLC cells. In contrasts, loss-of-function studies showed that inhibition of miR-29b promoted cell proliferation, migration and invasion of NSCLC cells in vitro. Nude mice xenograft tumor assay confirmed that miR-29b inhibited lung cancer growth in vivo. High-invasion (A549-H) and low-invasion (A549-L) NSCLC cell sublines from A549 cells were created by using the repeated transwell assay aimed to confirm the effect of miR-29b on migration and invasion of NSCLC. Furthermore, the dual-luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that miR-29b inhibited the expression of the luciferase gene containing the 3\"-UTRs of MMP2 and PTEN mRNA. Western blotting and quantitative RT-PCR indicated that miR-29b down-regulated the expression of MMP2 at the protein and mRNA levels.",
        "Renal fibrosis is a crucial event in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy (DN). The process known as epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) contributes to the accumulation of matrix proteins in kidneys, in which renal tubular epithelial cells play an important role in progressive renal fibrosis. The current study investigated that chrysin (5,7-dihydroxyflavone) present in bee propolis and herbs, inhibited renal tubular EMT and tubulointerstitial fibrosis due to chronic hyperglycemia. Human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (RPTEC) were incubated in media containing 5.5 mM glucose, 27.5 mM mannitol (as an osmotic control), or 33 mM glucose (HG) in the absence and presence of 1-20 \u03bcM chrysin for 72 h. Chrysin significantly inhibited high glucose-induced renal EMT through blocking expression of the mesenchymal markers vimentin, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, and fibroblast-specific protein-1 in RPTEC and db/db mice. Chrysin reversed the HG-induced down-regulation of the epithelial marker E-cadherin and the HG-enhanced N-cadherin induction in RPTEC. In addition, chrysin inhibited the production of collagen IV in tubular cells and the deposition of collagen fibers in mouse kidneys. Furthermore, chrysin blocked tubular cell migration concurrent with decreasing matrix metalloproteinase-2 activity, indicating epithelial cell derangement and tubular basement membrane disruption. Chrysin restored the induction of the tight junction proteins Zona occludens protein-1 (ZO-1) and occludin downregulated in diabetic mice. Chrysin inhibited renal tubular EMT-mediated tubulointerstitial fibrosis caused by chronic hyperglycemia. Therefore, chrysin may be a potent renoprotective agent for the treatment of renal fibrosis-associated DN.",
        "The purpose of this study was to investigate whether common variants across the nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 2 (NFE2L2) gene contribute to the development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in patients with severe sepsis. NFE2L2 is involved in the response to oxidative stress, and it has been shown to be associated with the development of ARDS in trauma patients.\n\nWe performed a case-control study of 321 patients fulfilling international criteria for severe sepsis and ARDS who were admitted to a Spanish network of post-surgical and critical care units, as well as 871 population-based controls. Six tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of NFE2L2 were genotyped, and, after further imputation of additional 34 SNPs, association testing with ARDS susceptibility was conducted using logistic regression analysis.\n\nAfter multiple testing adjustments, our analysis revealed 10 non-coding SNPs in tight linkage disequilibrium (0.75\\u2009\u2264\\u2009r (2) \\u2009\u2264\\u20091) that were associated with ARDS susceptibility as a single association signal. One of those SNPs (rs672961) was previously associated with trauma-induced ARDS and modified the promoter activity of the NFE2L2 gene, showing an odds ratio of 1.93 per T allele (95 % confidence interval, 1.17-3.18; p\\u2009=\\u20090.0089).",
        "To evaluate the transdentinal cytotoxicity of resin-based luting cements (RBLCs), with no HEMA in their composition, to odontoblast-like cells.\n\nHuman dentine discs 0.3\\xa0mm thick were adapted to artificial pulp chambers (APCs) and placed in wells of 24-well plates containing 1\\xa0mL of culture medium (DMEM). Two categories of HEMA-free RBLCs were evaluated: group 1, self-adhesive Rely X Unicem (RU; 3M ESPE), applied directly to the dentine substrate; and group 2, Rely X ARC (RARC; 3M ESPE), applied to dentine previously acid-etched and treated with a bonding agent. In group 3 (control), considered as representing 100% cell metabolic activity, no treatment was performed on dentine. The APC/disc sets were incubated for 24\\xa0h or 7\\xa0days at 37\\xa0\u00b0C and 5% CO2 .

Data from ALP activity were analysed by one-way anova and Tukey\"s test (\u03b1\\xa0=\\xa05%).\n\nIn group 1, a slight reduction in cell viability (11.6% and 16.8% for 24-h and 7-day periods, respectively) and ALP activity (13.5% and 17.9% for 24-h and 7-day periods, respectively) was observed, with no significant difference from group 3 (control) (P\\xa0>\\xa00.05). In group 2, a significant reduction in cell viability, TP production and ALP activity compared with group 3 (control) occurred (P\\xa0<\\xa00.05), regardless of incubation time. Alteration in MDPC-23 cell morphology was observed only in group 2.",
        "Netrins are a family of extracellular proteins that function as chemotropic guidance cues for migrating cells and axons during neural development. In the visual system, netrin-1 has been shown to play a key role in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axon growth and branching at the target, where presynaptic RGC axons form partnerships with the dendrites of tectal neurons. However, the signals that guide the connections between RGC axons and their postsynaptic partners are yet unknown. Here, we explored dynamic cellular mechanisms by which netrin-1 influences visual circuit formation, particularly those that impact postsynaptic neuronal morphology and connectivity during retinotectal wiring.\n\nTime-lapse in vivo imaging of individual Xenopus laevis optic tectal neurons co-expressing tdTomato and PSD95-GFP revealed rapid remodeling and reorganization of dendritic arbors following acute manipulations in netrin-1 levels. Effects of altered netrin signaling on developing dendritic arbors of tectal neurons were distinct from its effects on presynaptic RGC axons. Within 4\\xa0h of treatment, tectal injection of recombinant netrin-1 or sequestration of endogenous netrin with an UNC-5 receptor ectodomain induced significant changes in the directionality and orientation of dendrite growth and in the maintenance of already established dendrites, demonstrating that relative levels of netrin are important for these functions. In contrast, altering DCC-mediated netrin signaling with function-blocking antibodies induced postsynaptic specialization remodeling and changed growth directionality of already established dendrites. Reducing netrin signaling also decreased avoidance behavior in a visually guided task, suggesting that netrin is essential for emergent visual system function.",

We aimed to investigate the effects of a healthy diet associated with the Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa) in dyslipidemic and hypertensive patients.\n\nThis study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. Seventy-seven dyslipidemic and hypertensive patients already receiving lipid-lowering drugs received either a dietary treatment associated with partially defatted Brazil nut flour (13 g/day providing 227,5 \u03bcg of selenium/day),or with dyed cassava flour as a placebo. All patients received a personalized dietary guideline with nutritional recommendations for dyslipidemia and hypertension and were followed for 90 days.\n\nThe Brazil nut group showed reductions in total cholesterol (-20.5\\u2009\u00b1\\u200961.2 mg/dL, P\\u2009=\\u20090.02), non HDL-cholesterol (-19.5\\u2009\u00b1\\u200961.2 mg/dL, P\\u2009=\\u20090.02) and Apo A-1 (-10.2\\u2009\u00b1\\u200926.7 mg/dL, P\\u2009=\\u20090.03) without significant alterations in the Apo B/Apo A-1 ratio.

        "In neuroblastoma, activating ALK receptor tyrosine kinase point mutations play a major role in oncogenesis. We explored the potential occurrence of ALK mutations at a subclonal level using targeted deep sequencing.\n\nIn a clinically representative series of 276 diagnostic neuroblastoma samples, exons 23 and 25 of the ALK gene, containing the F1174 and R1275 mutation hotspots, respectively, were resequenced with an extremely high depth of coverage.\n\nAt the F1174 hotspot (exon 23), mutations were observed in 15 of 277 samples (range of fraction of mutated allele per sample: 0.562%-40.409%). At the R1275 hotspot (exon 25), ALK mutations were detected in 12 of 276 samples (range of fraction of mutated allele: 0.811%-73.001%). Altogether, subclonal events with a mutated allele fraction below 20% were observed in 15/27 ALK-mutated samples. The presence of an ALK mutation was associated with poorer 5-year overall survival (OS: 75% vs. 57%, P = 0.0212 log-rank test), with a strong correlation between F1174 ALK mutations and MYCN amplification being observed.",
        "Atrial fibroblasts and macrophages have long been thought to participate in atrial fibrillation (AF). However, which specific mediator may regulate the interaction between them remains unclear.\n\nWe provided the evidence for the involvement of Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-\u03b2 (TRIF), an important inflammation-related molecule, in the pathophysiology of AF. Patients with AF showed higher levels of angiotensin II (AngII) and TRIF expression and larger number of macrophages infiltration in left atria appendage than individuals with sinus rhythm (SR). In the cell study, AngII induced chemokines expressions in mouse atrial fibroblasts and AngII-stimulated atrial fibroblasts induced the chemotaxis of macrophages, which were reduced by losartan and TRIF siRNA. Meanwhile, AngII-stimulated atrial fibroblasts proliferation was enhanced by macrophages.",
        "Increasing evidence suggests that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptor (VEGFR) 1 signaling may play an important role in the progression of pathological angiogenesis that occurs in many tumors, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Therapeutic targeting directed against VEGF and VEGFR-2 has been proven to be successful for metastatic clear cell RCC (CCRCC). However, the expression of VEGFR-1 and its association with prognostic parameters of CCRCC in the tumorigenesis of renal cancer remains unclear. Therefore, we examined the expression of VEGFR-1 and its prognostic significance in CCRCC.\n\nImmunohistochemical staining for VEGFR-1 was performed on 126 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded CCRCC tissue samples. Six of these cases were available for Western blot analyses. The results were compared with various clinicopathologic parameters of CCRCC and patients\" survival.\n\nVEGFR-1 expression was detected in 59 cases (46.8%) of CCRCC. Higher VEGFR-1 expression was significantly correlated with a lower Fuhrman nuclear grade and the absence of renal pelvis invasion, although it was not related to patients\" survival. Western blot analyses showed higher VEGFR-1 expression in low grade tumors.",
        "The aim of this retrospective study is to determine the correlation between preoperative CRP levels and the early renal dysfunction after cardiac surgery.\n\nFrom January 2012 to December 2013, values for preoperative CRP were available for 546 unselected patients undergoing cardiac operations. CRP was used to divide this cohort in two groups: a normal CRP levels group (Group I) of 432 patients with CRP of less than 0.5 mg/dL, and a high CRP levels group (group II) of 114 patients with a CRP of 0.5 mg/dL or more.\n\nMedian CRP preoperative values were significantly different in the group II (2.49\u00b11.03 mg/dL) than in the group I (0.32\u00b10.14 mg/dL; P < 0.0001). Median CRP postoperative values were significantly different in the group I (17.62\u00b12.99) than in the group II (23.13\u00b13.01; P < 0.0001).

For control, 30 patients with spinal burst fractures were also enrolled in this study. Real-time PCR and western blotting was performed to measure the expression levels of COX-2 in intervertebral disc tissues, peripheral blood and cerebrospinal. Expression levels of miR-143 in intervertebral disc tissues, peripheral blood and cerebrospinal were detected by real-time PCR.\n\nThe expression levels of COX-2 were increased in intervertebral disc tissues, peripheral blood and cerebrospinal of patients with degenerative scoliosis when compared with those of patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and spinal burst fractures (P < 0.05).

        "Evidence from mouse models suggests that zinc-\u03b12-glycoprotein (ZAG) is a novel anti-obesity adipokine. In humans, however, data are controversial and its physiological role in adipose tissue (AT) remains unknown. Here we explored the molecular mechanisms by which ZAG regulates carbohydrate metabolism in human adipocytes.\n\nZAG action on glucose uptake and insulin action was analyzed. \u03b21 and \u03b22-adrenoreceptor (AR) antagonists and siRNA targeting PP2A phosphatase were used to examine the mechanisms by which ZAG modulates insulin sensitivity. Plasma levels of ZAG were measured in a lean patient cohort stratified for HOMA-IR.\n\nZAG treatment increased basal glucose uptake, correlating with an increase in GLUT expression, but induced insulin resistance in adipocytes. Pretreatment of adipocytes with propranolol and a specific \u03b21-AR antagonist demonstrated that ZAG effects on basal glucose uptake and GLUT4 expression are mediated via \u03b21-AR, whereas inhibition of insulin action is dependent on \u03b22-AR activation. ZAG treatment correlated with an increase in PP2A activity. Silencing of the PP2A catalytic subunit abrogated the negative effect of ZAG on insulin-stimulated AKT phosphorylation and glucose uptake but not on GLUT4 expression and basal glucose uptake. ZAG circulating levels were unchanged in a lean patient cohort stratified for HOMA-IR. Neither glucose nor insulin was associated with plasma ZAG.",
        "There is growing evidence that natural products, mostly plant-derived polyphenols, are important in the relationship between nutrients and health in humans.\n\nWe aimed to investigate if verbascoside (VB) and other lemon verbena polyphenols could ameliorate obesity-induced metabolic disturbances, as well as their putative mechanism.\n\nWe used an insulin-resistant hypertrophic 3T3-L1-adipocyte model to test the effects of VB or lemon verbena extract on triglyceride accumulation, inflammation and oxidative stress and a murine model of diet-induced obesity to assess the in vivo metabolic response.\n\nPolyphenols decreased triglyceride accumulation, the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and restored mitochondrial membrane potential in adipocytes. The underlying mechanisms seemed to occur via ROS-mediated downregulation of nuclear factor kappa-B transcription factor (NF-\u03baB) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-\u03b3)-dependent transcriptional upregulation of adiponectin. We also observed a potent activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), the mRNA expression upregulation of PPAR-\u03b1 and the mRNA expression downregulation of fatty acid synthase. Experiments in mice suggested a significant improvement in fat metabolism.",
        "Orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT) remains the gold standard for end-stage heart failure. However, donor availability is severely limited. With a median wait time of 6.6 months and more than 12% of patients waiting 5 or more years, the decision is often made to implant a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) as\\xa0a bridge to transplantation for medical stabilization. Furthermore, the number of patients who have had at least one prior sternotomy while awaiting transplantation is increasing. Previous studies have indicated reoperative sternotomy as a risk factor for compromised survival. Concerns are specifically focused on perioperative, short-term, and long-term outcomes after LVAD explantation or redo sternotomy before OHT because of increasing operative complexity. We hypothesize that despite the greater technical difficulty caused by LVAD explantation or redo sternotomy, outcomes would not be compromised.\n\nWe retrospectively analyzed patients who underwent OHT at the University of Pennsylvania during a 5-year period (2008-2013; n\\xa0= 253). All patients who underwent a bridge to transplantation LVAD (n\\xa0= 72) or prior sternotomy (n\\xa0= 65) were compared with those undergoing OHT with a virgin chest (n\\xa0= 116). Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables were analyzed. Short- and long-term survival were studied (minimum follow-up, 6 months).\n\nComorbidities were similar among the groups. There was no difference in donor allograft ischemic time (p\\xa0= 0.6). However, cardiopulmonary bypass time was longer in both bridge to transplantation and prior sternotomy cohorts (p < 0.00001). The blood transfusion requirement was higher in bridge to transplantation (12.5 \u00b1 13.7 units; p\\xa0= 0.0007) and prior sternotomy groups (11.7 \u00b1 12.9 units; p\\xa0= 0.02) as compared with the virgin chest cohort (7.1 \u00b1 10.7 units).

        "The term \"post-traumatic migraine\" (PTM) has been used to describe post-traumatic headaches (PTHs) that have associated migraine features, but studies of this relationship are lacking. The objective of the present study was to determine whether PTH correlates strongly with migraine symptoms among youth with concussion.\n\nTwenty-three symptoms were analyzed from a retrospective cohort of 1953 pediatric patients with concussion. A principal component analysis (PCA) with oblique Promax rotation was conducted to explore underlying symptom relationships in the full cohort and in subcohorts stratified by the presence (n\\u2009=\\u2009414) or absence (n\\u2009=\\u20091526) of premorbid headache.\n\nThe mean patient age was 14.1 years; 63% were male. Headache was the most common postconcussion symptom, acknowledged by 69.4% of patients. When considering the full cohort, the PCA demonstrated clustering of headache with photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, dizziness, and neck pain. Similar clustering was present among patients without premorbid headaches. Repeating the analysis in the patients with preconcussion headaches led to elimination of neck pain from the cluster.",

Operative times were stratified into 60-minute intervals and complication rates analyzed. Primary outcomes included 30-day overall, medical, and surgical complications. Bivariate analyses using \u03c7(2), Fisher\"s exact, and one-way analysis of variance tests were performed to compare clinical and procedural characteristics associated with longer operative time and complications. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were then performed to determine the independent association between operative time and perioperative complications.\n\nCanadian Task Force classification II-2 (Evidence obtained from well-designed cohort or case-control studies preferably from more than 1 center or research group).\n\nAmerican College of Surgeons NSQIP.\n\nPatients who underwent laparoscopic or robotic hysterectomy for benign disease from 2006 to 2011 at any institution participating in NSQIP.\n\nNone, retrospective database study.\n\nOf the 7630 laparoscopic and robotic hysterectomies identified, 399 patients (5.2%) experienced complications, most commonly urinary tract infection (UTI; 2.1%), superficial surgical site infection (1.0%), and blood transfusion (1.0%). Return to the operating room was required in 97 patients (1.3%), and there were 4 deaths, for a mortality rate of .05%. Complications increased steadily with longer operative time.

        "Podocalyxin-like 1 is a transmembrane glyco-protein whose overexpression associates in many cancers with poor prognosis and unfavorable clinicopathological characteristics. Until now, its prognostic value has never been studied in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The aim of this study was to investigate podocalyxin expression in PDAC by a novel monoclonal antibody and a commercially available polyclonal antibody.\n\nWith tissue microarrays and immuno-histochemistry, podocalyxin expression evaluation involved 168 PDAC patients. The associations of the podocalyxin tumor expression with clinicopathological variables were explored by Fisher\"s exact test and the linear-by-linear test. Survival analyses were by Kaplan-Meier analysis and the Cox proportional hazard model.\n\nThe polyclonal antibody revealed membranous podocalyxin expression in 73 (44.0%) specimens and the monoclonal antibody was highly expressed in 36 (21.8%) cases. Membranous expression by the polyclonal antibody was associated with T classification (p=0.045) and perineural invasion (p=0.005), and high expression by the mono-clonal antibody with poor differentiation (p=0.033). High podocalyxin expression associated significantly with higher risk of death from PDAC by both the polyclonal antibody (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.62; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12-2.33; p=0.01) and the monoclonal antibody (HR = 2.10, 95% CI 1.38-3.20; p<0.001).

Its in vivo topical effect on NV was investigated in the corneal micropocket mouse model (bevacizumab as a control). The vessel length, clock hours, and NV area were measured on photographs. The effect of AMA0526 on pathological wound healing was investigated in the alkali burn mouse model (dexamethasone as a control). Corneas were scored for corneal opacity (CO) and NV after burn injury. Immunohistochemistry was performed to study inflammation, blood vessel density, and collagen III deposition after 7 days.\n\nROCK inhibition significantly inhibited vascular endothelial cell proliferation and migration in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. In the micropocket model, NV was significantly reduced by AMA0526 (37% reduction, P < 0.05) comparable to bevacizumab. CO and NV were reduced after AMA0526, compared with the vehicle (P < 0.05 at all time points from day 3) after chemical burn. AMA0526 resulted in decreased inflammatory cell infiltration (26% reduction, P < 0.01), angiogenesis (47% reduction, P < 0.01), and collagen III deposition (27% reduction, P = 0.009) in the alkali burn model. AMA0526 administration showed results similar to those of dexamethasone with an additional antifibrotic effect.",
        "Pediatric systemic lupus erythematosus (pSLE) patients often initially present with more active and severe disease than adults, including a higher frequency of lupus nephritis. Specific autoantibodies, including anti-C1q, anti-DNA and anti-alpha-actinin, have been associated with kidney involvement in SLE, and DNA antibodies are capable of initiating early-stage lupus nephritis in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. Over 100 different autoantibodies have been described in SLE patients, highlighting the need for comprehensive autoantibody profiling. Knowledge of the antibodies associated with pSLE and proliferative nephritis will increase the understanding of SLE pathogenesis, and may aid in monitoring patients for renal flare.\n\nWe used autoantigen microarrays composed of 140 recombinant or purified antigens to compare the serum autoantibody profiles of new-onset pSLE patients (n = 45) to healthy controls (n = 17). We also compared pSLE patients with biopsy-confirmed class III or IV proliferative nephritis (n = 23) and without significant renal involvement (n = 18). We performed ELISA with selected autoantigens to validate the microarray findings. We created a multiple logistic regression model, based on the ELISA and clinical information, to predict whether a patient had proliferative nephritis, and used a validation cohort (n = 23) and longitudinal samples (88 patient visits) to test its accuracy.\n\nFifty autoantibodies were at significantly higher levels in the sera of pSLE patients compared to healthy controls, including anti-B cell-activating factor (BAFF). High levels of anti-BAFF were associated with active disease. Thirteen serum autoantibodies were present at significantly higher levels in pSLE patients with proliferative nephritis than those without, and we confirmed five autoantigens (dsDNA, C1q, collagens IV and X and aggrecan) by ELISA. Our model, based on ELISA measurements and clinical variables, correctly identified patients with proliferative nephritis with 91 % accuracy.",
        "Cartilage-bone integration is an important functional end point of cartilage repair therapy, but little is known about how to promote integration. We tested the hypothesis that chitosan-stabilized blood clot implant elicits osteoclasts to drilled cartilage defects and promotes repair and cartilage-bone integration.\n\nBilateral trochlear defects in 15 skeletally mature rabbit knees were microdrilled and then treated with chitosan-glycerol phosphate (GP)/blood implant with fluorescent chitosan tracer and thrombin to accelerate in situ solidification or with thrombin alone. Chitosan clearance, osteoclast density, and osteochondral repair were evaluated at 1, 2, and 8 weeks at the outside, edge, and through the proximal microdrill holes.\n\nChitosan was retained at the top of the drill holes at 1 week as extracellular particles became internalized by granulation tissue cells at 2 weeks and was completely cleared by 8 weeks. Osteoclasts burst-accumulated at microdrill hole edges at 1 week, in new woven bone at the base of the drill holes at 2 weeks, and below endochondral cartilage repair at 8 weeks. Implants elicited 2-fold more osteoclasts relative to controls (P < 0.001), a more complete drill hole bone repair, and improved cartilage-bone integration and histological tissue quality. Treated and control 8-week cartilage repair tissues contained 85% collagen type II. After 8 weeks of repair, subchondral osteoclast density correlated positively with bone-cartilage repair tissue integration (P < 0.0005).",

Strength of the knee extensor and flexor muscles were assessed using an isokinetic dynamometer. Activity limitations were assessed using the Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) - Physical Function subscale, the Get Up and Go test (GUG), and the 12-steps stairs test.

        "PON1 plays an important role in inhibiting LDL-C oxidation, which reduces atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Elevated PON1 activity or levels may contribute to increased HDL-C levels, but controversy exists over the hypothesis that genetic variation in the PON1 gene locus modulates HDL-C levels and responses to statin treatment. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the association between two polymorphisms in the PON1 gene and statin responses in a south Brazilian population.\n\nThe study population included 433 dyslipidemic patients who were prescribed statins. Total cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL-C and LDL-C levels were measured in these patients both before and after approximately 6months of treatment with simvastatin/atorvastatin. Genotypes were assessed by real-time PCR for two PON1 polymorphisms, Q192R (rs662) and L55M (rs854560).\n\nBaseline lipid levels were not associated with Q192R or L55M polymorphisms. For the Q192R (rs662) polymorphism, we observed that HDL-C goals were attained less often in patients with RR homozygosity than in Q allele carriers (\u03c7(2) P=0.009, adjusted residual analysis P=0.003). For the L55M (rs854560) polymorphism, LL homozygotes were underrepresented among subjects that achieved the HDL-C goal (\u03c7(2) P=0.026, adjusted residual analysis P=0.008).

The association between \u03b2-blocker therapy and the incidence of cardiovascular events (death, cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, revascularizations, angina requiring hospitalization, stroke or hospitalization for heart failure) or angina that was documented to be due to underlying ischemia was tested with Cox regression and propensity adjusted analyses.\n\nIn total, 1709 patients (76.5 %) were using a \u03b2-blocker. Patients had excellent control of risk factors; with mean systolic blood pressure being 121 \u00b1 14 mmHg, mean LDL cholesterol of 2.8 mmol/l, 59% of patients received statins and 92% of patients received antiplatelet therapy. During a median follow-up of 33 months, \u03b2-blocker therapy was not associated with a reduction in cardiovascular events (hazard ratio 0.97; 95 % confidence interval 0.74-1.27), documented angina (hazard ratio 0.85; 95 % confidence interval 0.61-1.19) or any of the individual components of the combined endpoint. There were no relevant interactions for demographics, comorbidities or surgical characteristics. Propensity matched and time-dependent analyses revealed similar results.",
        "Although extracellular matrix (ECM)-derived scaffolds have been extensively studied and applied in a number of clinical applications, the use of ECM as a biomaterial for (osteo)chondral regeneration is less extensively explored. This study aimed at evaluating the chondrogenic potential of cells seeded on cartilage-derived matrix (CDM) scaffolds in vitro.\n\nScaffolds were generated from decellularized equine articular cartilage and seeded with either chondrocytes or multipotent stromal cells (MSCs). After 2, 4, and 6 weeks of in vitro culture, CDM constructs were analyzed both histologically (hematoxylin and eosin, Safranin-O, collagen types I and II) and biochemically (glycosaminoglycan [GAG] and DNA content).\n\nAfter 4 weeks, both cell types demonstrated chondrogenic differentiation; however, the MSCs significantly outperformed chondrocytes in producing new GAG-containing cartilaginous matrix.",
        "Portal hypertension is one of the most important clinical conditions that cause intraoperative intensive hemorrhage in cirrhotic patients undergoing liver transplantation. Pre-transplant portal decompression may reduce the intraoperative bleeding during liver transplantation.\n\nSplenic artery trunk embolization (SATE) was performed one month prior to liver transplantation. Platelet count, prealbumin, international normalized ratio, and blood flow in the portal vein and hepatic artery were monitored before and one month after SATE. The measurements above were collected on admission and before surgery in the non-SATE patients, who served as controls. We also recorded the intraoperative blood loss, operating time, required transfusion, post-transplant ascites, and complications within three months after operation in all patients.\n\nSATE significantly reduced portal venous blood flow, increased hepatic arterial blood flow, normalized platelet count, and improved prealbumin and international normalized ratio in the patients before liver transplantation. Compared to the non-SATE patients, the pre-transplant SATE significantly decreased the operating time, intraoperative bleeding, post-transplant ascites and severe surgical complications.",
        "Several members of the SIRT family (SIRT1-7), which are a highly conserved family of NAD(+)-dependent enzymes, play an important role in tumor formation. Recently, several studies have suggested that SIRT4 can regulate glutamine metabolism yet have tumor suppressor function too. However, our understanding of SIRT4 expression and its association with the clinicopathological parameters remains poor.\n\nWe evaluated SIRT4 protein expression levels in gastric adenocarcinoma and corresponding normal gastric tissue by immunohistochemical staining on a tissue microarray that included 75 gastric adenocarcinoma patients. We also determined the association between SIRT4 expression levels and selected clinicopathological parameters in gastric adenocarcinoma.\n\nWe found that the expression level of SIRT4 in gastric adenocarcinoma was significantly lower than the corresponding normal tissue levels (P=0.003). Besides, lower SIRT4 levels were observed in pathological grade (P=0.002), depth of tumor invasion (P=0.034), positive lymph node numbers (P=0.005) and UICC stage (P=0.002).",
        "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) deriving from cirrhosis with HBV infection harbors higher morbidity and poor prognosis. The diagnosis of HCC at its early stage is essential for improving the effect of treatment and survival rate of patients.\n\nAffymetrix GeneChip was practiced to establish gene expression profile and significance analysis of microarray (SAM) as well as prediction analysis of microarray (PAM) was utilized to screen candidate marker genes in tissue of carcinoma and para-cancerous with cirrhosis from 15 hepatitis B virus (HBV) related HCC patients.\n\nTotal 497 differential genes were selected by microarray (fold change >2; P value<0.01). Then 162 significant genes were determined by SAM (fold change -1.46 to 1.28). A number of 8-genes showing \"poor risk signature\" was validated with threshold of 6.2, which was associated with cirrhosis progressing to HCC. Only 3 down-regulated and 2 up-regulated predictor genes had statistical difference in HCC and cirrhosis groups by RT-PCR (P value<0.01). Forkhead box protein 1 (FOXP1) and serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 1 (SPINK1) proteins were found significantly increased in carcinoma tissues than para-cancerous cirrhotic tissues by IH and WB.",
        "The riser pattern, an abnormal blood pressure (BP) rhythm in which sleep BP exceeds awake BP, is a predictor of future stroke events. Although the riser pattern is caused by autonomic dysfunction, its significance in heart failure (HF) patients is not established. HF patients often suffered from cognitive impairment (CI), but the relationship between riser pattern and CI is not clearly understood. We tested the hypothesis that the riser pattern is associated with mild CI, a form of brain damage that could develop to dementia.\n\nWe performed Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM), echocardiography, and blood tests in 444 HF patients just before leaving hospitals. Mild CI, a measure of cognitive function, was defined as the score <26.\n\nThe mean age of the patients was 68\u00b113 years; 61.5% were male; 22.5% were riser pattern. The MMSE score was significantly lower in the Riser group than in the Non-dipper and Dipper group (23\u00b14 vs. 25\u00b15, 26\u00b14, respectively, P < 0.01). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, a riser pattern was significantly associated with mild CI (odds ratio 2.38, 95% confidence intervals 1.29-4.42, P < 0.01) after adjusting for significant covariates.",
        "Allergy-related studies that include biological measurements of vitamin D preceding well-measured outcomes are needed.\n\nWe sought to examine the associations between early-life vitamin D levels and the development of allergy-related outcomes in the racially diverse Wayne County Health, Environment, Allergy, and Asthma Longitudinal Study birth cohort.\n\n25-Hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels were measured in stored blood samples from pregnancy, cord blood, and age 2 years. Logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs for a 5 ng/mL increase in 25(OH)D levels for the following outcomes at age 2 years: eczema, skin prick tests (SPTs), increased allergen-specific IgE level (\u2265 0.35 IU/mL), and doctor\"s diagnosis of asthma (3-6 years).\n\nPrenatal 25(OH)D levels were inversely associated with eczema (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.75-0.96). The association was stronger in white children (white children: OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.57-1.09; black children: OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.82-1.12), although this was not statistically significant. Cord blood 25(OH)D levels were inversely associated with having 1 or more positive SPT responses and aeroallergen sensitization. Both associations were statistically significant in white children (positive SPT response: OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.32-0.80; \u2265 1 aeroallergen sensitization: OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.28-0.92) in contrast with black children (positive SPT response: OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.68-1.14; \u2265 1 aeroallergen sensitization: OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.65-1.11). 25(OH)D levels measured concurrently with outcome assessment were inversely associated with aeroallergen sensitization (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.66-0.96) only among black children (white children: OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.87-1.69).",
        "We have previously reported that brief pressure overload of the left ventricle reduced myocardial infarct (MI) size. However, the role of protein kinase C (PKC) remains uncertain. In this study, we investigated whether pressure overload reduces MI size by activating PKC.\n\nMI was induced by a 40-minute occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery and a 3-hour reperfusion in anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats. MI size was determined using triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining. Brief pressure overload was achieved by two 10-minute partial snarings of the ascending aorta, raising the systolic left ventricular pressure 50% above the baseline value. Ischemic preconditioning was elicited by two 10-minute coronary artery occlusions and 10-minute reperfusions. Dimethyl sulfoxide (vehicle) or calphostin C (0.1\\xa0mg/kg, a specific inhibitor of PKC) was administered intravenously as pretreatment.\n\nThe MI size, expressed as the percentage of the area at risk, was significantly reduced in the pressure overload group and the ischemic preconditioning group (19.0\\xa0\u00b1\\xa02.9% and 18.7\\xa0\u00b1\\xa03.0% vs. 26.1\\xa0\u00b1\\xa02.6% in the control group, where p\\xa0<\\xa00.001). Pretreatment with calphostin C significantly limited the protection by pressure overload and ischemic preconditioning (25.2\\xa0\u00b1\\xa02.4% and 25.0\\xa0\u00b1\\xa02.3%, where p\\xa0<\\xa00.001). Calphostin C itself did not significantly affect MI size (25.5\\xa0\u00b1\\xa02.4%). Additionally, the hemodynamics, area at risk, and mortality were not significantly different.",
        "The pathogenesis of osteoarthritis (OA) is not fully understood, but bone changes are suggested to be important. Bone turnover and bone volume (BV) in human hip OA were investigated in relation to the overlying cartilage degeneration using design-based stereological estimators.\n\nFemoral heads were obtained from 25 end-stage OA patients and 24 controls (CTL). Design-based stereological methods were used for sampling and quantification to obtain absolute estimates of volume and surface in the central trabecular and the subarticular bone region. The subarticular bone was further subdivided into regions according to the OARSI-score of the overlying articular cartilage in which erosion and osteoid surfaces were estimated.\n\nIn the subarticular region, bone volume (BV/TV) was 15.0% higher in OA patients compared to CTL; The fraction of erosive (ES/BS) and osteoid surfaces (OS/BS) were 56.2% and 72.8% higher in OA compared to CTL. In subarticular regions with none to mild cartilage degeneration (OARSI grade 0-2), ES/BS and OS/BS were 48.6% and 59.9% higher in OA compared to CTL, whereas BV/TV did not differ between OA and CTL.",
        "Although leptin appears to be an important local and systemic factor influencing cartilage homeostasis, the role of leptin in chondrocyte death is largely unknown. Tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays a central role in the pathogenesis of articular diseases. This study examines whether leptin modulates TNF-\u03b1-induced articular chondrocyte death.\n\nPrimary rat articular chondrocytes were isolated from knee joint cartilage slices. To induce cell death, the chondrocytes were treated with TNF-\u03b1. To examine whether leptin modulates the extent of TNF-\u03b1-mediated chondrocyte death, the cells were pretreated with leptin for 3\\xa0h before TNF-\u03b1 treatment followed by viability analysis. To examine the mechanism by which leptin modulates the extent of TNF-\u03b1-mediated chondrocyte death, we utilized mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) measurements, flow cytometry, nuclear morphology observation, co-immunoprecipitation, western blot analysis and confocal microscopy.\n\nWe demonstrated that leptin suppresses TNF-\u03b1 induced chondrocyte death. We further found that apoptosis partially contributes to TNF-\u03b1 induced chondrocyte death while necroptosis primarily contributes to TNF-\u03b1 induced chondrocyte death. In addition, we observed that leptin exerts anti-TNF-\u03b1 toxicity via c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in rat articular chondrocytes.",
        "Recent studies applied laser-evoked potentials (LEP) for the analysis of small nerve fibre function and focused on the detection of stable C-fibre-mediated potentials (C-LEPs); high technical requirements were needed. The diagnostic significance is still controversially discussed. So far, only few studies focused on the susceptibility of C-LEPs to distraction and other influences. We hypothesized that C-LEPs are altered by habituation processes and distraction.\n\nTwelve subjects were tested with a C-fibre laser set-up (neodymium:yttrium-aluminium-perovskite laser with a 10-mm beam diameter and 10-ms stimulus time) at the left perioral area. In condition I, the subjects received repetitive painful laser stimuli at the right hand to induce habituation. In condition II, the subjects had to fulfil an auditory discrimination task (where the subjects had to estimate the pitch of different tones on a scale for 20\\xa0min). C-LEPs were retrieved before and after the habituation or distraction paradigm. C-LEPs were also measured in a control group who was not influenced by laser stimuli or other disturbances during a 23-min break between the two test sessions.\n\nIn both test conditions, there was significant C-LEP amplitude reduction. The LEP amplitudes of the control group remained unchanged.",
        "An important role has emerged for calpain enzymes in regulating inflammation with one isoform, calpain-2, particularly important for macrophage activation. The goal of this study was to determine the therapeutic potential of a synthetic calpain-2 inhibitor, zLLY-CH2F, for colitis and inflammation-associated colorectal cancer.\n\nMice were then subjected to the azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium model of colitis and colitis-associated cancer incorporating intervention with daily injections of 0.75 mg/kg calpain-2 inhibitor beginning after the first signs of colitis.\n\nCalpain-2 inhibitor treatment alleviated weight loss and bloody diarrhea, and reduced inflammatory infiltration into colon tissues and inflammatory cytokine mRNA. Calpain-2 inhibitor intervention also reduced total colitis-associated cancer tumor volume by up to 70% in vehicle control mice and decreased cancer pathology scores of blinded histological colon tissue analyses. Mechanistic investigations showed that calpain-2 inhibition during macrophage activation reduced inhibitor of kappa beta (I\u03baB) degradation and nuclear factor kappa beta (NF\u03baB) nuclear localization as well as secretion of specific inflammatory cytokines. In addition, calpain-2 inhibitor treatment of CT26.WT mouse and HT-29 human colorectal cancer cells decreased proliferation and reduced I\u03baB degradation and NF\u03baB translocation.",
        "Adherence to medication is a major issue in bipolar disorder. Non-planning impulsivity, defined as a lack of future orientation, has been demonstrated to be the main impulsivity domain altered during euthymia in bipolar disorder patients. It was associated with comorbidities.\n\nTo investigate relationship between adherence to medication and non-planning impulsivity, we included 260 euthymic bipolar patients. Adherence to medication was evaluated by Medication Adherence Rating Scale and non-planning impulsivity by Barrat Impulsiveness Scale. Univariate analyses and linear regression were used. We conducted also a path analysis to examine whether non-planning impulsivity had direct or indirect effect on adherence, mediated by comorbidities.\n\nAdherence to medication was correlated with non-planning impulsivity, even after controlling for potential confounding factors in linear regression analysis (Beta standardized coefficient = 0.156; p = 0.015). Path analysis demonstrated only a direct effect of non-planning impulsivity on adherence to medication, and none indirect effect via substance use disorders and anxiety disorders.",
        "Flap necrosis is generally regarded as the result of vasospasm, thrombosis, and infection.\n\nTo improve skin flap survival and lower the risk of side effects due to systemic drug delivery, we formulated and evaluated compound gels for transdermal application. The transdermal delivery of 1% azithromycin (AZM), 0.5% amlodipine besylate (AB), and 300 IU/g low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in compound gels, singly or in combinations, was measured across rat skin in vitro. The effects of AB and LMWH on flap blood circulation was investigated using fluorescein angiography, by transdermally applying the gel onto the surface of an in vivo ischaemic flap rat model; concentrations of the drugs were detected in both blood plasma and flap tissue at assigned timepoints. Finally, infected ischaemic flaps were treated to evaluate their anti-inflammatory effects and sizes of flap survival area.\n\nEach drug efficiently penetrated the in vitro skin in a time-dependent manner. In the in vivo ischaemic flaps, AB or LMWH increased the blood supply. All gel formulations that included AZM were associated with less flap inflammation. The surviving areas after treatment with AZM+LMWH or AZM+AB were significantly larger than that treated with the AZM-only gel, and the largest surviving area was that treated with AZM+AB+LMWH. Gels containing no AZM could not decrease flap inflammation or increase flap survival.",
        "Compound 10b is a hybrid molecule of edaravone and a ring-opening derivative of 3-n-butylphthalide (NBP). The aim of this study was to examine the effects of compound 10b on brain damage in rats after focal cerebral ischemia.\n\nSD rats were subjected to 2-h-middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). At the onset of reperfusion, the rats were orally treated with NBP (60 mg/kg), edaravone (3 mg/kg), NBP (60 mg/kg)+edaravone (3 mg/kg), or compound 10b (70, 140 mg/kg). The infarct volume, motor behavior deficits, brain water content, histopathological alterations, and activity of GSH, SOD, and MDA were analyzed 24 h after reperfusion. The levels of relevant proteins in the ipsilateral striatum were examined using immunoblotting.\n\nAdministration of compound 10b (70 or 140 mg/kg) significantly reduced the infarct volume and neurological deficits in MCAO rats. The neuroprotective effects of compound 10b were more pronounced compared to NBP, edaravone or NBP+edaravone. Furthermore, compound 10b significantly upregulated the protein levels of the cytoprotective molecules Bcl-2, HO-1, Nrf2, Trx, P-NF-\u03baB p65, and I\u03baB-\u03b1, while decreasing the expression of Bax, caspase 3, caspase 9, Txnip, NF-\u03baB p65, and P-I\u03baB-\u03b1.",
        "Wogonin (5,7-dihydroxy-8-methoxyflavone), a major bioactive compound of the flavonoid family, is commonly extracted from the traditional Chinese medicine Scutellaria baicalensis and possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities and is assumed to have anti-diabetes function. Indeed, a current study has shown that it can possibly treat metabolic disorders such as those found in db/db mice. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains largely unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of wogonin on osteopontin (OPN) expression in adipose tissue from type 1 diabetic mice and in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.\n\nType 1 diabetes was induced by streptozotocin (STZ) injection. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were converted to 3T3-L1 adipocytes through treatment with insulin, dexamethasone, and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX). Western blot analysis and RT-PCR were performed to detect protein expression and mRNA levels, respectively.\n\nWogonin treatment suppressed the increase in serum OPN levels and reduced OPN expression in adipose tissue from STZ-induced type 1 diabetic mice. Administration of wogonin enhanced PPAR\u03b1 expression and activity. Silencing of PPAR\u03b1 diminished the inhibitory effects of wogonin on OPN expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Furthermore, the levels of c-Fos and phosphorylated c-Jun were reduced in wogonin-treated adipose tissue and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In addition, wogonin treatment dramatically mitigated p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK by its specific inhibitor SB203580 increased PPAR\u03b1 activity and decreased OPN expression.",
        "The aim of the study was to determine whether hepatocyte mitochondrial injury instigates severe shock and to explore effective therapy.\n\nWistar rats were randomly divided into five groups: Control (sham) group, shock + normal saline, shock + cyclosporine A, shock + resveratrol (Res) and shock + polydatin (PD) group. Mitochondrial morphology and function in hepatocytes following treatment were determined.\n\nHepatocytes following severe shock exhibited mitochondrial dysfunction characterized with opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores, mitochondrial swelling, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m) and reduced ATP levels. Moreover, severe shock induced oxidative stress with increased lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species, decreased SOD2 (Superoxide Dismutase 2) and GSH/GSSG, which resulted in increased lysosomal membrane permeabilization and hepatocyte mitochondrial injury. Additionally, Res and PD restored decreased deacetylase sirtuin1 activity and protein expression in liver tissue following severe shock, suppressed oxidative stress-induced lysosomal unstability and mitochondrial injury by increasing the protein expression of SOD2, and thereby contributed to the prevention of hepatocyte mitochondria dysfunction and liver injury.",
        "Patients with metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) have variable survival outcomes. We have previously shown that an elevated peripheral blood lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) is associated with an increased metastatic risk in patients with primary NPC. The present study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of pretreatment LMR in a large cohort of metastatic NPC patients.\n\nClinical data of 672 patients with metastatic NPC diagnosed between January 2003 and December 2009 were analyzed. The peripheral lymphocyte and monocyte counts were retrieved, and LMR was calculated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and univariate and multivariate COX proportional hazards analyses were performed to evaluate the association of LMR with overall survival (OS).\n\nUnivariate analysis revealed that an elevated absolute lymphocyte count (\u22651.390\u00d710(9)/L) and LMR (\u22652.475) as well as a decreased monocyte count (<0.665\u00d710(9)/L) were significantly associated with prolonged OS. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis showed that LMR (hazard ratio [HR]=0.50, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.41-0.60, P<0.001), absolute lymphocyte count (HR=0.77, 95% CI=0.64-0.93, P=0.007), and monocyte count (HR=1.98, 95% CI=1.63-2.41, P<0.001) were independent prognostic factors.

Immunohistochemistry was done for MUC1 expression, flow cytometry for ICAM-1 expression, fluorescence quantitative PCR for MUC1 expression and Western blot assay for the expressions of cell cycle related proteins (CDK4, Rb and p-ERK1/2) and apoptosis related proteins (Bax and Bcl-2). Cells were seeded into Matrigel pre-coated Transwell chambers, and the migrating cells were counted.\n\nCombined treatment with ATRA and Genistein was able to reduce the expressions of Bcl-2, MUC1 and ICAM-1 and exerted synergistic effects to inhibit the invasion of A549 cells.",
        "The 30-minute rule for RBC concentrates out of controlled temperature storage does not take into account multiple parameters that influence warming of RBC concentrates. This study evaluated two temperature-sensitive indicators (TIs) for monitoring RBC concentrates during transport.\n\nTI labels (Check-Spot [Harald H. Temmel KG, Gleisdorf, Austria] and Thermoindikator V4 [BASF, Basel, Switzerland]) were attached to RBC concentrates prior to delivery. Duration of transport, ambient temperatures, and label results (valid vs expired) were recorded. We evaluated the proportion of labels discrepant to the 30-minute rule overall and among deliveries 30 minutes or less and more than 30 minutes and compared the rates of valid and expired readings between both TIs.\n\nIn total, 201 RBC concentrate deliveries (86.6%) lasted 30 minutes or less, and 31 (13.4%) were more than 30 minutes. Forty-six (19.8%) Check-Spot and 37 (15.9%) Thermoindikator V4 results were discrepant to the 30-minute rule. Sixteen (51.6%) and 27 (87.1%) RBC concentrate deliveries more than 30 minutes displayed valid label readings with Check-Spot and Thermoindikator V4, respectively.

The protein level of BMP-2 was assessed by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was employed to measure the amount of BMP-2 in culture media. The mRNA levels of BMP-2 and osteocalcin were assayed quantitatively by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The middle portion of bilateral radius in New Zealand rabbits was excised and implanted with tissue engineered bone. And the modified areas were monitored by radiology, hematoxylin-eosin staining and immunohistochemical staining of BMP-2.\n\nPEG-BMP-2 nanoparticles (NPs) and BMP-2 loaded PEG-PLA-PCL tissue engineered bones were successfully constructed. The novel PEG-PLA-PCL NPs/DNA complex was superior for transfecting BMP-2 in rBMSCs compared to traditional liposomes.

        "Prostate cancer is the most frequent cancer in men in Europe. A major focus in urology is the identification of new biomarkers with improved accuracy in patients with low-risk prostate cancer. Here, we evaluated two-dimensional neovascular complexity in prostate tumor and nontumor biopsy cores by use of a computer-aided image analysis system and assessed the correlations between the results and selected clinical and pathological parameters of prostate carcinoma.\n\nA total of 280 prostate biopsy sections from a homogeneous series of 70 patients with low-risk prostate cancer (Gleason score 3+3, prostate-specific antigen [PSA]<10 ng/mL, and clinical stage T1c) who underwent systematic biopsy sampling and subsequent radical prostatectomy were analyzed. For each biopsy, 2-\u00b5m sections were treated with CD34 antibodies and were digitized by using an image analysis system that automatically estimates the surface fractal dimension.\n\nOur results showed that biopsy sections without cancer were significantly more vascularized than were tumors.

Group 1 (n=1,743) included patients treated between 2005 and 2009 with fluoroquinolone for 3 days, group 2 (n=2,723) included those treated between 2009 and 2012 with ceftriaxone once before the biopsy and fluoroquinolone before biopsy and continue therapy for 3 days, and group 3 (n=1,111) received the same treatment for more than 7 days after the biopsy. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models addressed risk factors associated with infectious complication after prostate needle biopsy.\n\nInfectious complication after prostate needle biopsy developed in 18 (group 1), seven (group 2), and two patients (group 3) (p=0.001). In group 1, seven patients with infectious complication had positive blood cultures and harbored fluoroquinolone-resistant Escherichia coli, four had ceftriaxone susceptible isolates, and three had extended spectrum beta-lactamase-positive E. coli. Two patients in group 1 required intensive care because of septic shock. In multivariable analysis, the patients with combination of fluoroquinolone and ceftriaxone had significantly lower infectious complication rate than the fluoroquinolon alone (p=0.003).",
        "Previous studies have found different outcomes after revision of knee arthroplasties performed after high tibial osteotomy (HTO). We evaluated the risk of revision of total knee arthroplasty with or without previous HTO in a large registry material.\n\n31,077 primary TKAs were compared with 1,399 TKAs after HTO, using Kaplan-Meier 10-year survival percentages and adjusted Cox regression analysis.\n\nThe adjusted survival analyses showed similar survival in the 2 groups. The Kaplan-Meier 10-year survival was 93.8% in the primary TKA group and 92.6% in the TKA-post-HTO group. Adjusted RR was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.77-1.21; p = 0.8).",
        "Postoperative muscle strength and component alignment are important factors affecting functional results after total knee arthroplasty (TKA). We are not aware of any studies that have investigated the relationship between them. We therefore investigated whether coronal malalignment of the mechanical axis and/or of individual implant components would affect knee muscle strength and function 1 year after TKA surgery.\n\nWe included 120 consecutive osteoarthritis (OA) patients admitted for TKA. Preoperative active range of motion (ROM) of the knee, patient age, sex, and BMI were recorded and the Knee Society score (KSS) and knee joint extensor/flexor muscle strength were assessed. At 1-year follow-up, the mechanical and coronal component alignment was measured from a postoperative long standing radiograph, and ROM, KSS, and muscle strength measurements were taken in 91 patients. Functional outcome and muscle strength measurements were compared between normally aligned and malaligned TKA groups.\n\n29 of 91 TKAs were malaligned, i.e. they deviated more than 3\u00b0 from the neutral mechanical axis. 18 femoral components and 15 tibial components were malaligned. Before surgery, the malaligned and normally aligned groups were similar regarding sex distribution, BMI, ROM, KSS, and muscle strength. At the 1-year follow-up, the differences between the groups regarding knee joint function and muscle strength were small, not statistically significant, and barely clinically relevant.",
        "Intermolecular multiple quantum coherences (iMQCs) are a source of MR contrast with applications including temperature imaging, anisotropy mapping, and brown fat imaging. Because all applications are limited by signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), we developed a pulse sequence that detects intermolecular zero quantum coherences with improved SNR.\n\nA previously developed pulse sequence that detects iMQCs, HOMOGENIZED with off resonance transfer (HOT), was modified with a multi-spin echo spatial encoding scheme (MSE-HOT). MSE-HOT uses a series of refocusing pulses to generate a stack of images that are averaged in postprocessing for higher SNR. MSE-HOT performance was quantified by measuring its temperature accuracy and precision during hyperthermia of ex vivo red bone marrow samples.\n\nMSE-HOT yielded a three-fold improvement in temperature precision relative to previous pulse sequences. Sources of improved precision were 1) echo averaging and 2) suppression of J-coupling in the methylene protons of fat. MSE-HOT measured temperature change with an accuracy of 0.6\u00b0C.",
        "Adenocarcinoma is the most dominant type of lung cancer in never-smoker patients. The risk alleles from genome-wide association studies have small odds ratios and unclear biologic roles. Here we have taken an approach featuring suitable medical actionability to identify alleles with low population frequency but high disease-causing potential.\n\nWhole-genome sequencing was performed for a family with an unusually high density of lung adenocarcinoma with available DNA from the affected mother, four affected daughters, and one nonaffected son. Candidate risk alleles were confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectroscopy. Validation was conducted in an external cohort of 1,135 participants without cancer and 1,312 patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Family follow-ups were performed by genotyping the relatives of the original proband and the relatives of the identified risk-allele carriers. Low-dose computed tomography scans of the chest were evaluated for lung abnormalities.\n\nYAP1 R331W missense mutation from the original family was identified and validated in the external controls and the cohort with lung adenocarcinoma. The YAP1 mutant-allele carrier frequency was 1.1% in patients with lung adenocarcinoma compared with 0.18% in controls (P = .0095), yielding an odds ratio (adjusted for age, sex, and smoking status) of 5.9. Among the relatives, YAP1-mutant carriers have overwhelmingly higher frequencies of developing lung adenocarcinoma or ground-glass opacity lung lesions than those who do not carry the mutation (10:0 v 1:7; P < .001). YAP1 mutation was shown to increase the colony formation ability and invasion potential of lung cancer cells.",
        "To evaluate bone quantity and quality in postmenarchal adolescents treated for idiopathic central precocious puberty (CPP) in childhood with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog (GnRHa) and to determine the serum concentrations of bone remodeling markers.\n\nThis cross-sectional study included 53 postmenarchal adolescent girls who were divided into 2 groups: 27 adolescents who were treated with GnRHa in childhood for idiopathic CPP (the CPP group) and 26 women who presented with physiological development of secondary sex traits (the control group).\n\nNone.\n\nWeight, height, body mass index, age at menarche, time since menarche, body composition, bone mineral density (BMD), bone quality, and serum insulin, glucose, osteocalcin, and carboxyl-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen concentrations were compared in the 2 groups. BMD data were analyzed by using both dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and osteosonography, and body composition was measure with the use of DXA and electrical bioimpedance.\n\nBMD and bone quality did not differ significantly between the CPP and control groups when analyzed by using DXA or osteosonography. Serum osteocalcin concentration was significantly lower (P = .02) in the CPP than in the control group. Insulin was higher in the CPP group, and hyperinsulinemia was an independent predictor of bone quantity and quality assessed by using osteosonography. Body mass index and percent fat were determined by using DXA, and the duration of use of GnRHa treatment and the time since GnRHa discontinuation were not independent predictors of bone quantity and quality.",
        "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and heart failure (HF) are common coexisting diseases. Intermittent hypoxia (IH), caused by repeated apnea/hypopnea events, accompanied by increased systemic inflammation, might contribute to the promotion of HF.\n\nTo assess the hypothesis, rats were exposed to IH or normal air condition 4 weeks on the basis of normal heart function or pre-existing HF, which was induced by pressure overload caused by abdominal aortic constriction surgery performed 12 weeks earlier. Echocardiography was performed before and after IH exposure to evaluate left ventricular (LV) function. Serum concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Flow cytometric analysis was used to determine the apoptotic rate of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs).\n\nThe echocardiographic study showed a significant decrease in LV fractional shortening (FS) and ejection fraction (EF) as well as an increase in the LV relative wall thickness (RWT) index in HF rats, which was aggravated by further exposure to IH compared with single-handed HF-only and sham-IH and sham-control groups. A reduced PMN apoptotic rate was observed in HF-IH rats compared with HF-only, sham-IH, and sham-control rats. Serum concentrations of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 were also increased in HF-IH rats, accompanied by delayed PMN apoptosis, indicating significant systemic inflammation induced by IH.",
        "Vaginal epithelial cells (VECs) produce antimicrobial peptides including human \u03b2-defensin 2 (hBD2) and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), as well as cytokines and chemokines that play vital roles in mucosal innate immunity of the female reproductive tract. Houttuynia cordata Thunb (H. cordata), a herbal plant found in Asia, possesses various activities including antimicrobial activity and anti-inflammation. As inflammation and infection are commonly found in female reproductive tract, we aimed to investigate the effects of H. cordata water extract in modulating innate immune factors produced by VECs.\n\nPrimary human VECs were cultured and treated with H. cordata at a concentration ranging from 25-200\\xa0\u03bcg/ml for 6 or 18\\xa0h. After treatment, the cells and culture supernatants were harvested. The expression of hBD2 and SLPI mRNA was evaluated by quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR. Levels of secreted hBD2 and SLPI as well as cytokines and chemokines in the supernatants were measured by ELISA and Luminex assay, respectively. Cytotoxicity of the extract on VECs was assessed by CellTiter-Blue Cell Viability Assay.\n\nH. cordata did not cause measurable toxicity on VECs after exposure for 18\\xa0h. The expression of hBD2 and SLPI mRNA as well as the secreted hBD2 protein were increased in response to H. cordata exposure for 18\\xa0h when compared to the untreated controls. However, treatment with the extract for 6\\xa0h had only slight effects on the mRNA expression of hBD2 and SLPI. The secretion of IL-2 and IL-6 proteins by VECs was also increased, while the secretion of CCL5 was decreased after treatment with the extract for 18\\xa0h. Treatment with H. cordata extract had some effects on the secretion of IL-4, IL-8, CCL2, and TNF-\u03b1, but not statistically significant.",
        "Diabetic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) exhibit significantly increased rates of proliferation and migration, which was the most common pathological change in atherosclerosis. In addition, the study about the role for miRNAs in the regulation of VSMC proliferation is just beginning to emerge and additional miRNAs involved in VSMC proliferation modulation should be identified.\n\nThe expression of miR-138 and SIRT1 were examined in SMCs separated from db/db mice and in SMC lines C-12511 exposed to high glucose with qRT-PCR and western blot. The regulation of miR-138 on the expression of SMCs was detected with luciferase report assay. VSMCs proliferation and migration assays were performed to examine the effect of miR-138 inhibitor on VSMCs proliferation and migration.\n\nWe discovered that higher mRNA level of miR-138 and reduced expression of SIRT1 were observed in SMCs separated from db/db mice and in SMC lines C-12511. Moreover, luciferase report assay showed that the activity of SIRT1 3\"-UTR was highly increased by miR-138 inhibitor and reduced by miR-138 mimic. In addition, we examined that the up-regulation of NF-\u03baB induced by high glucose in SMCs was reversed by resveratrol and miR-138 inhibitor. MTT and migration assays showed that miR-138 inhibitor attenuated the proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells.",
        "Knee cartilage defects represent a socioeconomic burden and may cause lifelong disability. Studies have shown that cartilage defects are detected in approximately 60% of knee arthroscopies. In clinical trials, the majority of these patients are excluded. This study investigates whether patients included in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) represent a selected group compared to general cartilage patients.\n\nPublished randomized clinical trials on cartilage repair studies were identified (May 2009) and analyzed to define common inclusion criteria that in turn were applied to all patients submitted to our cartilage repair center during 2008. Patient-administered Lysholm knee score was used to evaluate functional level at referral. In addition, previous surgery and size and localization of cartilage defects were recorded.\n\nCommon inclusion criteria in the referred patients and patients included in the published RCTs were single femoral condyle lesion, age range 18 to 40 years, and size of lesion range 3.2 to 4.0 cm(2). Six of 137 referred patients matched all the 7 RCTs. Previous cartilage repair and multiple lesions were associated with decreased Lysholm score (P < 0.002). Lysholm score was independent of age, gender, and time of symptoms from the defect.",
        "The demand for hematologists and oncologists is not being met. We hypothesized that an inpatient hematology-oncology ward rotation would increase residents\" interest. Potential reasons mitigating interest were explored and included differences in physician distress, empathy, resilience, and patient death experiences.\n\nAgreement with the statement \"I am interested in pursuing a career/fellowship in hematology and oncology\" was rated by residents before and after a hematology-oncology rotation, with 0 = not true at all, 1 = rarely true, 2 = sometimes true, 3 = often true, and 4 = true nearly all the time. House staff rotating on a hematology-oncology service from November 2013 to October 2014 also received questionnaires before and after their rotations containing the Connors-Davidson Resilience Scale, the Impact of Events Scale-Revised, the Interpersonal Reactivity Index, demographic information, and number of dying patients cared for and if a sense of meaning was derived from that experience.\n\nFifty-six residents completed both before- and after-rotation questionnaires (response rate, 58%). The mean interest score was 1.43 initially and decreased to 1.24 after the rotation (P = .301). Female residents\" mean score was 1.13 initially and dropped to 0.81 after the rotation (P = .04). Male residents\" mean score was 1.71 initially and 1.81 after the rotation (P = .65).

        "To investigate whether neuron-glial antigen 2 (NG2) could be an effective prognostic marker in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).\n\nNG2 expression was semi-quantitatively scored from the immunohistochemistry (IHC) data based on the number of positive cells and the staining intensity. A total of 132 HCC specimens and 96 adjacent noncancerous tissue samples were analyzed by IHC for NG2 protein expression. To confirm the NG2 expression levels observed by IHC, we measured NG2 expression in 30 randomly selected tumor and adjacent noncancerous tissue samples by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot. The correlations between NG2 protein expression and the clinicopathological features of HCC patients were analyzed using the \u03c7 (2) test. To assess the prognostic value of NG2 for HCC, the association between NG2 expression and survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test. To further evaluate the prognostic value of NG2 expression, a Cox multivariate proportional hazards regression analysis was performed with all the variables to derive risk estimates related to disease-free and overall survival and to control for confounders.\n\nHigh NG2 expression was observed in significantly more primary tumor samples (63.6%; 84/132) compared with the adjacent noncancerous tissue samples (28.1%; 27/96) (P < 0.0001). Moreover, high NG2 protein expression was closely associated with tumor differentiation (\u03c7 (2) = 9.436, P = 0.0089), recurrence (\u03c7 (2) = 5.769, P = 0.0163), tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage (\u03c7 (2) = 8.976, P = 0.0027), and invasion (\u03c7 (2) = 5.476, P = 0.0193). However, no significant relationship was observed between NG2 protein expression in HCC and other parameters, such as age, sex, tumor size, serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP), tumor number, or tumor capsule. The log-rank test indicated a significant difference in the overall survival of HCC patients with high NG2 expression compared with those with low NG2 expression (29.2% vs 9.5%, P < 0.001). Moreover, NG2 expression in HCC tissue signi\ufb01cantly correlated with disease-free survival (15.2% vs 6.7%, P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that NG2 expression (HR = 2.035, P = 0.002), serum AFP (HR = 1.903, P = 0.003), TNM stage (HR = 2.039, P = 0.001), and portal vein invasion (HR = 1.938, P = 0.002) were independent prognostic indicators for OS in HCC patients. Furthermore, NG2 expression (HR = 1.974, P = 0.003), serum AFP (HR = 1.767, P = 0.008), TNM stage (HR = 2.078, P = 0.001), tumor capsule (HR = 0.652, P = 0.045), and portal vein invasion (HR = 1.941, P = 0.002) were independent prognostic indicators for DFS in HCC patients.",

The T2DM patients were divided into three groups based on the absence of complications (group B) presence of microvascular disease (group C) or macrovascular disease (group D). DNA of all enrolled subjects was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) for the MCP-1 A-2518G polymorphism. Serum MCP-1 levels were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).\n\nParticipants in group D had increased serum MCP-1 levels relative to group B, group C, and group A (all p<0.01). Compared with group A, the frequencies of the MCP-1 A-2518G G/G genotype and G allele were significantly higher in group C and group D (all p<0.05). In contrast to group B, group C had higher frequencies of the G/G genotype and G allele, while group D had higher G allele frequencies (all p<0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that lower body-mass index (BMI) and free cholesterol (FC), as well as higher high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels may be the protective factors for T2DM, while higher levels of triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and G/G genotype frequency were independent risk factors for T2DM.",
        "Alterations in the intestinal microbiota, characterized by depletion of anti-inflammatory bacteria, such as Firmicutes, in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) have prompted interest in microbiota-modulating strategies for this condition. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of fecal and synthetic human microbial ecosystems, low or enriched in Firmicutes, on colitis susceptibility and host immune responses.\n\nThe microbiota of selected healthy and UC human donors was characterized by culture method and 16S rRNA-based sequencing. Germ-free mice were colonized with fecal or a synthetic ecosystem enriched (healthy donors) or low (UC donors) in Firmicutes. Experimental colitis was induced using dextran sodium sulfate. Colon transcriptome and colon lamina propria cells were evaluated in mice postcolonization by RNA-seq and flow cytometry, respectively, and T helper (TH) 17 differentiation was assessed in vitro.\n\nMice colonized with microbiota from patients with UC low in Firmicutes had increased sensitivity to colitis compared with mice colonized with fecal or synthetic ecosystems rich in Firmicutes. Microbiota low in Firmicutes increased expression of TH17-related genes and expansion of interleukin-17A-expressing CD4 cells in vivo. Supplementation with bacterial isolates belonging to the Firmicutes phylum abrogated the heightened TH17 responses in vitro.",
        "Oleuropein promoted cultured human follicle dermal papilla cell proliferation and induced LEF1 and Cyc-D1 mRNA expression and \u03b2-catenin protein expression in dermal papilla cells. Nuclear accumulation of \u03b2-catenin in dermal papilla cells was observed after oleuropein treatment. Topical application of oleuropein (0.4 mg/mouse/day) to C57BL/6N mice accelerated the hair-growth induction and increased the size of hair follicles in telogenic mouse skin. The oleuropein-treated mouse skin showed substantial upregulation of Wnt10b, FZDR1, LRP5, LEF1, Cyc-D1, IGF-1, KGF, HGF, and VEGF mRNA expression and \u03b2-catenin protein expression.",
        "The aim of this study was to assess the outcomes of early vascular release in robot-assisted laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (RAPN) to reduce warm ischaemia time (WIT) and minimise renal dysfunction. RAPN is increasingly utilised in the management of small renal masses. To this end it is imperative that WIT is kept to a minimum to maintain renal function.\n\nRAPN was performed via a four-arm robotic transperitoneal approach. The renal artery and vein were individually clamped with robotic vascular bulldog clamps to allow cold scissor excision of the tumour. The cut surface was then sutured with one or two running 3-0 V-Loc (TM) sutures, following which the vascular clamps were released. Specific bleeding vessels were then selectively oversewn and the collecting system repaired. Renorrhaphy was then completed using a running horizontal mattress 0-0 V-Loc (TM) suture.\n\nA total of 16 patients underwent RAPN with a median WIT of 15 minutes (range: 8-25), operative time 230 minutes (range: 180-280) and blood loss of 100 mL (range: 50-1000). There were no transfusions, secondary haemorrhages or urine leaks. There was one focal positive margin in a central 5.5 cm pT3a renal cell carcinomas (RCC).

The proportion of correctly answered knowledge questions pre- (78.0% \u00b1 10.0%) to postintervention (mean = 87.4% \u00b1 6.0%) increased significantly (t = 7.16, P < 0.001).",
        "Decreased renal function has been consistently included among factors prompting recommendation for surgery in primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). However, most retrospective studies addressing this issue did not show an improvement in renal function after parathyroidectomy (PTX). The aim of this study was to investigate changes in renal function after PTX in PHPT patients subdivided according to renal function at diagnosis.\n\nThis was a retrospective cross-sectional study.\n\nWe studied 109 consecutive PHPT patients before and after PTX. Biochemical evaluation included fasting total and ionized serum calcium, phosphate, creatinine, immunoreactive intact PTH, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was assessed with the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation.\n\nMean (\u00b1 SD) CKD-EPI estimated GFR (eGFR) at diagnosis was 82.4 \u00b1 19.3 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (median, 84.8 mL/min/1.73 m(2); interquartile range, 68.5-94.2 mL/min/1.73 m(2)). Patients with eGFR equal to or higher than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (group 1, n = 95) were significantly younger than patients with eGFR lower than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (group 2, n = 14; P < .0003). After PTX, eGFR did not change in patients of group 2 (P = .509), whereas it was significantly reduced in patients of group 1 (P < .0002). The difference in eGFR between baseline and post-PTX values was correlated negatively with baseline serum creatinine (R = -0.27; P = .0052) and positively with baseline CKD-EPI eGFR (R = 0.32; P = .00062). At multiple regression analysis, only systolic blood pressure and baseline CKD-EPI eGFR were independent predictors of GFR variation.",

        "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of RNAs that do not code protein but play important roles in diverse biological processes. In recent years, with the application of high-throughput sequencing, a great deal of lncRNAs associated with virus infections have been discovered and intensively studied, but there are few studies about the relationship between lncRNAs and HCV replication.\n\nWe identify that several lncRNAs can be upregulated and downregulated by phosphorylated STAT3 by using human PCR array method. And among these lncRNAs, lnc-Lethe was involved in the HCV replication. Transfection of siRNA Lethe partially blocked the replication of HCV in Huh7 cells.\n\nIn the present study, we have established that phosphorylated STAT3 can promote the HCV replication. Data also indicated that when transfected with siRNA Lethe, the expression levels of PKR, OAS and IRF1, which were all ISGs, were all up regulated.",

We investigated whether plasma FA composition was related to stroke severity and functional outcome in acute ischemic stroke patients.\n\nWe prospectively enrolled 156 patients with first-episode cerebral infarction, within 7 days of symptom onset. The proportion of FAs was analyzed using gas chromatography, and the summation of the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (\u03c93-PUFA), 18:3 \u03c93 \u03b1-linolenic acid, 20:3 \u03c93 eicosatrienoic acid, 20:5 \u03c93 eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and 22:6 \u03c93 docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was reported as \u03a3\u03c93-PUFAs. Stroke severity was assessed using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score on admission. Poor functional outcome was defined by modified Rankin scale (mRS) \u22653 at three months after the index stroke.\n\nLower proportions of EPA (\u03b2=-0.751), DHA (\u03b2=-0.610), and \u03a3\u03c93-PUFAs (\u03b2=-0.462) were independently associated with higher NIHSS score, after adjusting for stroke subtype, hemoglobin, high density lipoprotein, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, fasting glucose, 16:0 palmitic acid, and \u03a3saturated fatty acids.

        "Difficulty understanding speech in background noise is a common complaint of individuals with sensorineural hearing loss. Recent animal studies suggest this difficulty may be due, in part, to spiral ganglion cell degeneration related to aging or noise exposure. Although auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds and standard clinical audiometric tests are minimally affected by neuronal degeneration, the amplitude of wave I of the ABR is correlated to spiral ganglion cell density.\n\nThis study hypothesized that wave I amplitude was correlated to speech-in-noise performance. To test this, the relationships between wave I amplitude, age, and speech perception ability were analyzed in human participants.\n\nThis is a correlational study.\n\nA total of 101 ears from 57 adults ranging in age from 19 to 90 yr with a pure-tone average of 45 dB HL or better were examined in this study. Only individuals with no history of neurological disease and ears without any evidence of conductive involvement were included.\n\nSpeech perception was measured in quiet using NU-6 word lists and in background noise using the QuickSIN. Ear canal electrodes were used to obtain ABR waveforms from each ear and the amplitude of wave I was measured as the absolute difference in voltage between the peak of the wave and the following trough. Speech perception performance in quiet and in background noise were both modeled using a linear mixed model with the covariates age, four-frequency pure-tone average (4fPTA), wave I amplitude, and the interaction between 4fPTA and wave I amplitude. ABR wave I amplitudes were modeled using a linear mixed model with age and 4fPTA as the covariates. The correlation between the right and left ears of the same participant were modeled using random effects.\n\nThe results indicate that reduced ABR wave I amplitudes are (1) related to increased age, (2) associated with decreased speech-in-noise performance, with the greatest effects in individuals with poorer pure-tone thresholds, and (3) not correlated to speech perception in quiet.",
        "Patients undergoing immune modulatory therapies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, and individuals with an impaired-immune system, most notably AIDS patients, are in the high risk group of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), an often lethal disease of the brain characterized by lytic infection of oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS) with JC virus (JCV). The immune system plays an important regulatory role in controlling JCV reactivation from latent sites by limiting viral gene expression and replication. However, little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms responsible for this regulation.\n\nHere, we investigated the impact of soluble immune mediators secreted by activated PBMCs on viral replication and gene expression by cell culture models and molecular virology techniques. Our data revealed that viral gene expression and viral replication were suppressed by soluble immune mediators. Further studies demonstrated that soluble immune mediators secreted by activated PBMCs inhibit viral replication induced by T-antigen, the major viral regulatory protein, by suppressing its expression in glial cells. This unexpected suppression of T-antigen was mainly associated with the suppression of translational initiation. Cytokine/chemokine array studies using conditioned media from activated PBMCs revealed several candidate cytokines with possible roles in this regulation. Among them, only IFN-\u03b3 showed a robust inhibition of T-antigen expression. While potential roles for IFN-\u03b2, and to a lesser extent IFN-\u03b1 have been described for JCV, IFN-\u03b3 has not been previously implicated. Further analysis of IFN-\u03b3 signaling pathway revealed a novel role of Jak1 signaling in control of viral T-antigen expression. Furthermore, IFN-\u03b3 suppressed JCV replication and viral propagation in primary human fetal glial cells, and showed a strong anti-JCV activity.",
        "Fast tracks are one approach to reduce emergency department (ED) crowding. No studies have assessed the use of fast tracks in smaller hospitals with single physician coverage. Our study objective was to determine if implementation of an ED fast track in a single physician coverage setting would improve wait times for low-acuity patients without negatively impacting those of higher acuity.\n\nA daytime fast track opened in 2010 at Strathroy Middlesex General Hospital, a southwestern Ontario community hospital. Before and after intervention groups comprised of ED visits in 2009 and 2011 were compared. Pooled comparison of all Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS) patients in each period, and between subgroups CTAS 2-5 comparisons were performed for: wait time (WT), length of stay (LOS), WTs that met national CTAS time guidelines (MNCTG), and proportion of patients that left without being seen (LWBS).\n\nWT and LOS were six minutes (88 min to 82 min, p=0.002) and 15 minutes (158 min to 143 min, p<0.001) lower, respectively, in the post-intervention period. Subgroup analysis showed CTAS 4 had the most pre- to post-intervention decrease in WT, of 13 minutes (98 min to 85 min, p<0.001). There was statistical improvement in MNCTG in the post-intervention period. No differences were found in outcome measures for higher-acuity patients or LWBS rates.",
        "Neuroblastoma is a pediatric cancer of neural crest origin. Despite aggressive treatment, mortality remains at 40 % for patients with high-risk disseminated disease, underscoring the need to test new combinations of therapies. In murine tumor models, our laboratory previously showed that T cell-mediated anti-tumor immune responses improve in the context of lymphopenia. The goal of this study was to incorporate lymphodepletion into an effective immune therapy that can be easily translated into neuroblastoma standard of care. Based on the lymphodepleting effects of cyclophosphamide, we hypothesized that cyclophosphamide would synergize with the TLR9 agonist, CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN), to produce a T cell-mediated anti-neuroblastoma effect.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, we used the AgN2a aggressive murine model of neuroblastoma. Mice bearing subcutaneous tumors were treated with cyclophosphamide followed by treatment with tumor cell lysate mixed with CpG ODN injected at the tumor site.\n\nSubcutaneous neuroblastoma regressed only in mice that were treated with 100\\xa0mg/kg cyclophosphamide prior to receiving treatments of tumor lysate mixed with CpG ODN. The anti-neuroblastoma response was T cell-mediated. Synergy between cyclophosphamide and the tumor lysate/CpG ODN treatment influenced the production of anti-tumor CD8 T cell effectors, and dendritic cell homeostasis. For clinical consideration, an allogeneic tumor lysate was used effectively with this protocol to eliminate AgN2a tumor in vivo.",
        "The acquisition of drug resistance is one of the most malignant phenotypes of cancer and identification of its therapeutic target is a prerequisite for the development of novel therapy. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in various types of cancer and proposed as potential therapeutic targets for patients. In the present study, we aimed to identify miRNA that could serve as a therapeutic target for taxane-resistant prostate cancer.\n\nIn order to identify miRNAs related to taxane-resistance, miRNA profiling was performed using prostate cancer PC-3 cells and paclitaxel-resistant PC-3 cell lines established from PC-3 cells. Microarray analysis of mRNA expression was also conducted to search for potential target genes of miRNA. Luciferase reporter assay was performed to examine miRNA binding to the 3\"-UTR of target genes. The effects of ectopic expression of miRNA on cell growth, tubulin polymerization, drug sensitivity, and apoptotic signaling pathway were investigated in a paclitaxel-resistant PC-3 cell line.\n\nThe expression of miR-130a was down-regulated in all paclitaxel-resistant cell lines compared with parental PC-3 cells. Based on mRNA microarray analysis and luciferase reporter assay, we identified SLAIN1 as a direct target gene for miR-130a. Transfection of a miR-130a precursor into a paclitaxel-resistant cell line suppressed cell growth and increased the sensitivity to paclitaxel. Lastly, ectopic expression of miR-130a did not affect the polymerized tubulin level, but activated apoptotic signaling through activation of caspase-8.",
        "Since the original description by Zone et al in 1994, the disease entity and target antigens in linear IgA/IgG bullous dermatosis (LAGBD) have not been clarified in 20 years.\n\nTo determine autoantibodies and autoantigens in a new LAGBD case which showed atypical clinical and histopathological findings without apparent mucosal involvement.\n\nWe performed various indirect immunofluorescence and immunoblotting studies.\n\nIndirect immunofluorescence of 1M NaCl-split skin showed IgG and IgA reactivity with both epidermal and dermal sides. Immunoblotting studies using various antigen sources revealed circulating IgG and IgA antibodies reactive with laminin-332, laminin-\u03b31 and integrin \u03b16\u03b24 in various patterns. Absorption study using recombinant proteins of laminin-\u03b31 indicated that the patient serum reacted with different epitopes between laminin-\u03b31 and laminin-\u03b32.",
        "Brain disorders remain the world\"s leading cause of disability, and account for more hospitalizations and prolonged care than almost all other diseases combined. The majority of drugs, proteins and peptides do not readily permeate into brain due to the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), thus impeding treatment of these conditions.\n\nAttention has turned to developing novel and effective delivery systems to provide good bioavailability in the brain.\n\nIntranasal administration is a non-invasive method of drug delivery that may bypass the BBB, allowing therapeutic substances direct access to the brain. However, intranasal administration produces quite low drug concentrations in the brain due limited nasal mucosal permeability and the harsh nasal cavity environment. Pre-clinical studies using encapsulation of drugs in nanoparticulate systems improved the nose to brain targeting and bioavailability in brain. However, the toxic effects of nanoparticles on brain function are unknown.",
        "Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor for glaucoma, a degenerative disease characterized by the loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). There is clinical and experimental evidence that neuroinflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of glaucoma. Since the blockade of adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) confers robust neuroprotection and controls microglia reactivity in the brain, we now investigated the ability of A2AR blockade to control the reactivity of microglia and neuroinflammation as well as RGC loss in retinal organotypic cultures exposed to elevated hydrostatic pressure (EHP) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS).\n\nRetinal organotypic cultures were either incubated with LPS (3 \u03bcg/mL), to elicit a pro-inflammatory response, or exposed to EHP (+70 mmHg), to mimic increased IOP, for 4 or 24 h, in the presence or absence of the A2AR antagonist SCH 58261 (50 nM). A2AR expression, microglial reactivity and neuroinflammatory response were evaluated by immunohistochemistry, quantitative PCR (qPCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RGC loss was assessed by immunohistochemistry. In order to investigate the contribution of pro-inflammatory mediators to RGC loss, the organotypic retinal cultures were incubated with rabbit anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) (2 \u03bcg/mL) and goat anti-interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) (1 \u03bcg/mL) antibodies.\n\nWe report that the A2AR antagonist (SCH 58261) prevented microglia reactivity, increase in pro-inflammatory mediators as well as RGC loss upon exposure to either LPS or EHP. Additionally, neutralization of TNF and IL-1\u03b2 prevented RGC loss induced by LPS or EHP.",
        "To evaluate the association between brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), a convenient, non-radiating, readily available measurement of arterial stiffness, and coronary artery calcium (CAC), a reliable marker of coronary atherosclerosis, in a large sample of young and middle-aged asymptomatic adults; and to assess the incremental value of baPWV for detecting prevalent CAC beyond traditional risk factors.\n\nCross-sectional study of 15,185 asymptomatic Korean adults who voluntarily underwent a comprehensive health screening program including measurement of baPWV and CAC. BaPWV was measured using an oscillometric method with cuffs placed on both arms and ankles. CAC burden was assessed using a multi-detector CT scan and scored following Agatston\"s method.\n\nThe prevalence of CAC\\xa0>\\xa00 and CAC\\xa0>\\xa0100 increased across baPWV quintiles. The multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (95% CI) for CAC\\xa0>\\xa00 comparing baPWV quintiles 2-5 versus quintile 1 were 1.06 (0.87-1.30), 1.24 (1.02-1.50), 1.39 (1.15-1.69) and 1.60 (1.31-1.96), respectively (P trend\\xa0<\\xa00.001). Similarly, the relative prevalence ratios for CAC\\xa0>\\xa0100 were 1.30 (0.74-2.26), 1.59 (0.93-2.71), 1.74 (1.03-2.94) and 2.59 (1.54-4.36), respectively (P trend\\xa0<\\xa00.001). For CAC\\xa0>\\xa0100, the area under the ROC curve for baPWV alone was 0.71 (0.68-0.74), and the addition of baPWV to traditional risk factors significantly improved the discrimination and calibration of models for detecting prevalent CAC\\xa0>\\xa00 and CAC\\xa0>\\xa0100.",
        "Given that helminth infections have been shown to improve insulin sensitivity in animal studies, which may be explained by beneficial effects on energy balance or by a shift in the immune system to an anti-inflammatory profile, we investigated whether soil-transmitted helminth (STH)-infected subjects are more insulin sensitive than STH-uninfected subjects.\n\nWe performed a cross-sectional study on Flores island, Indonesia, an area with high prevalence of STH infections.\n\nFrom 646 adults, stool samples were screened for Trichuris trichiura by microscopy and for Ascaris lumbricoides, Necator americanus, Ancylostoma duodenale, and Strongyloides stercoralis by qPCR. No other helminth was found. We collected data on body mass index (BMI, kg/m2), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), fasting blood glucose (FBG, mmol/L), insulin (pmol/L), high sensitive C-reactive protein (ng/ml) and Immunoglobulin E (IU/ml). The homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMAIR) was calculated and regression models were used to assess the association between STH infection status and insulin resistance.\n\n424 (66%) participants had at least one STH infection. STH infected participants had lower BMI (23.2 vs 22.5 kg/m2, p value = 0.03) and lower HOMAIR (0.97 vs 0.81, p value = 0.05). In an age-, sex- and BMI-adjusted model a significant association was seen between the number of infections and HOMAIR: for every additional infection with STH species, the HOMAIR decreased by 0.10 (p for linear trend 0.01). This effect was mainly accounted for by a decrease in insulin of 4.9 pmol/L for every infection (p for trend = 0.07).",
        "Integrin-linked kinase (ILK), a serine/threonine protein kinase, has roles in cell signaling and molecular scaffolding. ILK mutation/deletion causes cardiomyopathic phenotypes, but the functional and electrophysiological features have not been characterized. This study investigated the structural, functional, ion channel, and electrophysiological changes associated with cardiomyocyte-directed ILK deletion in mice.\n\nAdult mice with cardiomyocyte-directed ILK knockout were compared with littermate controls. Knockout mice showed markedly increased mortality, with sudden death beginning after 5 weeks and 100% mortality at 18 weeks. In 10-week-old knockout mice, spontaneous and inducible ventricular tachyarrhythmias were common, occurring in 60% and 86%, respectively, and absent in controls (P<0.001, P<0.05 versus knockout mice). Ventricular refractoriness was prolonged, along with both QRS and QT interval. Action potentials were prolonged and displayed triggered activity. A wide range of ion currents were downregulated, including total, fast and slow components of transient outward K(+) current and inward rectifier K(+) current, along with corresponding ion channel subunit genes, providing a plausible explanation of action potential prolongation. At 5 weeks, only voltage-dependent K(+) currents were reduced, possibly related to direct ILK-Kv4.2 subunit interactions. Action potentials were prolonged, but no arrhythmias or cardiac dysfunction were noted. Structural remodeling was prominent at 10 weeks: connexin-43 was downregulated and redistributed to lateral cell margins, and left ventricular fibrosis occurred, with a strong regional distribution (predominating in the basal left ventricle). Conduction was slowed. High-throughput quantitative polymerase reaction gene-expression studies in 10-week-old ILK knockout showed upregulation of structural, remodeling and fibrosis-related genes, and downregulation of a wide range of ion channel and transporter subunits.",
        "Airway surface dehydration, caused by an imbalance between secretion and absorption of ions and fluid across the epithelium and/or increased epithelial mucin secretion, impairs mucociliary clearance. Recent evidence suggests that this mechanism may be implicated in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, the role of airway surface dehydration in the pathogenesis of cigarette smoke (CS)-induced COPD remains unknown.\n\nWe aimed to investigate in vivo the effect of airway surface dehydration on several CS-induced hallmarks of COPD in mice with airway-specific overexpression of the \u03b2-subunit of the epithelial Na\u207a channel (\u03b2ENaC).\n\n\u03b2ENaC-Tg mice and wild-type (WT) littermates were exposed to air or CS for 4 or 8 weeks. Pathological hallmarks of COPD, including goblet cell metaplasia, mucin expression, pulmonary inflammation, lymphoid follicles, emphysema and airway wall remodelling were determined and lung function was measured.\n\nAirway surface dehydration in \u03b2ENaC-Tg mice aggravated CS-induced airway inflammation, mucin expression and destruction of alveolar walls and accelerated the formation of pulmonary lymphoid follicles. Moreover, lung function measurements demonstrated an increased compliance and total lung capacity and a lower resistance and hysteresis in \u03b2ENaC-Tg mice, compared to WT mice. CS exposure further altered lung function measurements.",
        "The interaction between fatness, fitness, and C-reactive protein (CRP) in adolescents is not well characterized but may be important to prevent low grade inflammation. The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between adiposity, different expressions of fitness, and CRP in late adolescence using direct measures of fitness and fatness.\n\nAnthropometric measurements were taken on 245 eighteen-year-old participants (116 girls). Fasting CRP, glucose, and insulin were measured and homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) calculated. Body composition was estimated via dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Fitness was assessed with maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) during a treadmill test and also expressed relative to the fat-free mass (VO2maxFFM).\n\nPrevalence of overweight/obesity based on body mass index (BMI) was 20.7% and 25.6% among girls and boys, respectively (p = 0.407), but 42.5% and 58.1% when based on body fat percentage (%fat, p = 0.015). Higher proportion of boys (81.3%) than girls (54.5%) were highly fit (p<0.001), but the percentage of girls with high levels of CRP was greater (12.1% vs 6.2%, p = 0.028). Adiposity, indicated with BMI, waist circumference, fat mass, android fat mass (aFM), or %fat, was positively associated with CRP independent of VO2max (r = 0.13-0.18, p<0.05) and VO2maxFFM (r = 0.24-0.32, p<0.001). VO2max, was negatively associated with CRP independent only of BMI and waist circumference (r = -0.21, p = 0.001), but not %fat, fat mass or aFM (r = -0.08 to -0.12, p>0.05). VO2maxFFM was unrelated to CRP with (r = -0.07 to -0.11, p>0.05) or without (r = -0.10, p = 0.142) adjustment for adiposity. Additional adjustment for HOMA did not change any of the relationships, although the coefficients were attenuated.",
        "An appropriate plasma concentration of fentanyl is the key to achieving good pain control in cancer patients. Cachexia, a multifactorial syndrome, is known to affect drug-metabolizing enzymes. However, the fentanyl concentrations in the blood of patients with cachexia have not been analyzed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of cancer cachexia on dose-adjusted plasma fentanyl concentrations in cancer patients.\n\nBlood was collected from 21 Japanese cancer patients treated with a 24-hour trans-dermal fentanyl patch during the steady state of fentanyl plasma concentration. Plasma fentanyl concentrations were analyzed using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and the levels were adjusted with the dose of fentanyl. Laboratory data were collected, and the cachexia stage was determined, based on study by Fearon et al. Multiple regression analysis was performed to identify the factors that affected fentanyl plasma concentrations.\n\nEight patients were classified as precachexia, nine as cachexia, and four as refractory cachexia, and the median dose-adjusted fentanyl concentrations (ng/mL per mg/kg/day) were 27.5, 34.4, and 44.5, respectively. The dose-adjusted fentanyl concentration in patients with refractory cachexia was higher than that in patients with precachexia (Kruskal-Wallis test and post hoc Mann-Whitney U-test, P<0.01). The factors that were found to possibly affect the dose-adjusted concentration of fentanyl included aspartate aminotransferase, C-reactive protein, and estimated glomerular filtration rate, when analyzed as six independent variables (multiple regression analysis, P<0.05).",
        "People who undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are highly dependent on their caregiver during their lengthy treatment and recovery. The effectiveness of their caregiver\"s social support can profoundly affect their day-to-day treatment experiences and, in turn, how they recall those experiences and are affected by them long after the treatment ends.\n\nOur participants were 182 men and women who had undergone a transplant within the previous 9 months to 3 years. They completed baseline measures (including a measure of caregiver social support effectiveness) and then completed three writing assignments describing their transplant experiences. Linguistic analyses were conducted to investigate their use of words indicating negative emotions, cognitive processing (insight and causation), and practical problems with money and insurance. Theory-based hypotheses predicted associations between specific functional types of caregiver support (emotional, informational, and instrumental) and these word categories.\n\nAs hypothesized, the effectiveness of different functional types of support from a caregiver were uniquely associated with theoretically relevant categories of word use. Structural equation models indicated that more effective caregiver emotional support predicted lower use of negative emotion words; more effective caregiver informational support predicted lower use of causation words; and more effective caregiver instrumental support predicted lower use of words related to money and insurance.",
        "Palivizumab is reported to be effective in reducing respiratory syncytial virus hospitalisation. Its licensed uses include infants younger than six months of age, born before 35\\xa0weeks of gestation or under two years old with congenital heart disease or bronchopulmonary dysplasia. We redressed lack of research in the Netherlands by studying whether infants who met the licensed indications received the drug.\n\nData were obtained from the PHARMO Database Network and The Netherlands Perinatal Registry for all linked infants born between 1 April 1999 and 31 March 2007. Determinants for receiving palivizumab were examined using logistic regression analyses.\n\nOnly 15% of the 3321 infants who met the licensed indications received palivizumab and the strongest predictor was being born before 32\\xa0weeks of gestation, with an odds ratio of 49.1 (95% confidence interval 31.5-76.4).

        "Fetuses with congenital heart disease (CHD) show evidence of abnormal brain development before birth, which is thought to contribute to adverse neurodevelopment during childhood. Our aim was to evaluate whether brain development in late pregnancy can be predicted by fetal brain Doppler, head biometry and the clinical form of CHD at the time of diagnosis.\n\nThis was a prospective cohort study including 58 fetuses with CHD, diagnosed at 20-24\\u2009weeks\" gestation, and 58 normal control fetuses. At the time of diagnosis, we recorded fetal head circumference (HC), biparietal diameter, middle cerebral artery pulsatility index (MCA-PI), cerebroplacental ratio (CPR) and brain perfusion by fractional moving blood volume. We classified cases into one of two clinical types defined by the expected levels (high or low) of placental (well-oxygenated) blood perfusion, according to the anatomical defect. All fetuses underwent subsequent 3T-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 36-38\\u2009weeks\" gestation.\n\nAbnormal prenatal brain development was defined by a composite score including any of the following findings on MRI: total brain volume\\u2009<\\u2009\\u200910(th) centile, parietoccipital or cingulate fissure depth\\u2009<\\u2009\\u200910(th) centile or abnormal metabolic profile in the frontal lobe.

        "We determined detailed time-course changes in the irisin response to acute exercise using different exercise modes.\n\nIn experiment 1, seven healthy males rested for 12h (8:00-20:00) to determine the diurnal variation in plasma irisin concentration. In experiment 2, 10 healthy males conducted three exercises to clarify time-course changes in plasma irisin concentration over 6h, using a randomized crossover design. The resistance exercise (R) trial consisted of eight exercises of 12 repetitions with 3-4 sets at 65% of one repetition maximum (1RM). The endurance exercise (E) trial consisted of 60 min of pedaling at 65% of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max). In the combined mode (R+E) trial, 30 min of endurance exercise was preceded by 30 min of resistance exercise.\n\nIn experiment 1, no significant changes in plasma irisin concentration were observed over 12h. In experiment 2, the R trial showed a marked increase in plasma irisin concentration 1h after exercise (P<0.05), but not in the E or R+E trials. The area under the curve (AUC) for irisin concentrations for 6h after exercise was significantly higher in the R trial than in the R+E trial (P<0.05). The AUC for irisin concentrations was significantly correlated with AUC values for blood glucose, lactate, and serum glycerol (r=0.37, 0.45, 0.45, respectively. P<0.05).",
        "This study aimed to clarify the relationship between host nutritional status prior to first-line chemotherapy and therapeutic effect, and, whether these nourishment indexes could become factors that predict long-term convalescence in unresectable advanced or recurrent colorectal cancer or not. Summary of Background Date: It has previously been reported that postoperative complications and long-term prognosis of patients with gastrointestinal malignancies may be affected by their nutritional status. But, there is little information regarding the relationship between prognosis, nutritional status and immunocompetence in unresectable progressive or recurrent colorectal cancer.\n\nNinety patients who had measurable target lesions underwent resection for primary colorectal cancer in our institution, between April 2007 and March 2013. The indicators of host nutritional status was body weight (BW), body mass index (BMI), serum albumin, Onodera\"s prognostic nutritional index (OPNI) and Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS). The indicators of host immunocompetence was total lymphocyte counts, total neutrophil counts, granulocytes/lymphocytes ratio (G/L ratio).\n\nThe median overall survival (OS) was 32.5 months, and the median progression-free survival was 10.9 months. The relative change of target lesions were associated with BW, BMI and OPNI. Furthermore, there was strong correlation between the change ratio of the serum CEA level before and after chemotherapy administration and BMI. BW, BMI, serum albumin level, OPNI and GPS were significantly associated with overall survival (OS).",
        "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with high morbidity and mortality, even despite the use of oral anticoagulation (OAC). Soluble suppression of tumorigenicity-2 (sST2) is a member of the interleukin-1 receptor family [interleukin-1 receptor-like 1 (IL1RL1)], which has been associated with an increased risk of mortality and morbidity in heart failure or acute coronary syndrome. We assessed the predictive value of sST2 levels in an unselected \"real-world\" cohort of anticoagulated AF patients.\n\nWe included 562 patients (49% male; median age 77 [IQR: 71-82]) with permanent AF who were stable (for at least 6 months) on OAC (INRs 2.0-3.0). sST2 levels were quantified by ELISA. Patients were followed-up for up to 4 years, and cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality were recorded.\n\nMedian (IQR) of sST2 levels was 51.23 (39.09-67.40) \u03bcg/L. Median follow-up was 1587 days [IQR 1482-1617], and during this period, 91 patients died (16.2%, 3.72%/year). The c-statistic for predicting mortality with sST2 was 0.58 + 0.03; P = 0.017). On multivariate analysis, age [hazard ratio (HR) 1.09 (1.05-1.13); P < 0.001], diabetes mellitus [1.76 (1.08-2.88); P = 0.023], previous stroke [2.16 (1.29-3.60); P = 0.003] and sST2 levels [1.008 (1.002-1.14); P = 0.008] were independently associated with mortality.

        "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent angiogenic factor. This study evaluated whether the VEGF mRNA level in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) tissue could be a biomarker to predict the progression and prognosis of OSCCs in Taiwan.\n\nThis study used quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (quantitative RT-PCR) to detect the VEGF mRNA levels in 60 OSCC specimens. Threshold cycle (CT) was defined as the PCR cycle number needed to generate a predetermined amount of DNA (threshold). The relative amount of tissue VEGF mRNA, standardized against the amount of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA, was expressed as \u0394CT = (VEGF CT - GAPDH CT). For a chosen threshold, a smaller starting copy number of mRNA results in a higher CT value. Thus, the lower the \u0394CT, the greater the copy number of VEGF mRNA in tissues.\n\nThe lower mean VEGF mRNA \u0394CT value was significantly associated with OSCCs with larger tumor size (p\\xa0=\\xa00.040), positive lymph node metastasis (p\\xa0=\\xa00.023), and more advanced clinical stages (p\\xa0=\\xa00.008). VEGF mRNA \u0394CT value < 4.2 (p\\xa0=\\xa00.026) was identified as an independent unfavorable prognosis factor using multivariate regression analyses. Moreover, Kaplan-Meier curve showed that OSCC patients with a VEGF mRNA \u0394CT value < 4.2 had a significantly poorer overall survival than those with a VEGF mRNA \u0394CT value \u22654.2 (log-rank test, p\\xa0=\\xa00.0427).",

        "We studied whether residual high-frequency oscillations (80-500 Hz; ripples, 80-250 Hz), especially fast ripples (FRs, 250-500 Hz), in post-resection intraoperative electrocorticography (ECoG) predicted seizure recurrence in comparison to residual interictal spikes and ictiform spike patterns.\n\nWe studied, retrospectively, ECoG recorded at 2,048 Hz after resection in a cohort of patients with refractory focal epilepsy. We analyzed occurrence and number of residual FRs, ripples, interictal spikes, and ictiform spike patterns within the last minute of each recording and compared these to seizure recurrence.\n\nWe included 54 patients (median age 15.5 years) with 25 months median follow-up. Twenty-four patients had recurrent seizures. We found residual FRs, ripples, spikes, and ictiform spike patterns in 12, 51, 38, and 9 patients. Nine out of 12 patients with residual FRs had recurrent seizures (p = 0.016, positive predictive value 75%). Other ECoG events did not predict seizure recurrence. Patients with seizures had higher FR rates than seizure-free patients (p = 0.022). FRs near the resection and in distant pathologic areas could have changed the resection in 8 patients without harming functionally eloquent areas. One seizure-free patient had FRs in distant functionally eloquent areas.",
        "The association between ongoing myocardial damage and outcomes in patients with Brugada syndrome who had received an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is unclear.\n\nConsecutive patients with Brugada syndrome (n=31, 50\u00b113 years) who had received an ICD were prospectively enrolled. Minor myocardial membrane injury [heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP) >2.4ng/mL] and myofibrillar injury (troponin T >0.005ng/mL) were defined using receiver operating characteristic curves. Patients were followed for a median period of 5 years to an endpoint of appropriate ICD shock.\n\nMyocardial membrane injury (29%) and myofibrillar injury (26%) were similarly prevalent among patients with Brugada syndrome who had received ICDs. Appropriate ICD shocks occurred in 19% of patients during the follow-up period. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that serum H-FABP level >2.4ng/mL, but not troponin T level, was an independent prognostic factor for appropriate ICD shock due to ventricular fibrillation [hazard ratio (HR) 25.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.33-1686, p=0.03].",
        "An alarming increase in infections due to penicillin non-susceptible pneumococci (PNSP) has been documented in nearly all countries. Increasingly, PNSP are also resistant to other antibiotics, and a growing number of clinical failures following the use of these agents have been reported.\n\nTo determine the resistance pattern of pneumococcal isolates from patients with invasive pneumococcal infection in North West Nigeria.\n\nIn a cross-sectional study clinical specimens were obtained from patients with community acquired pneumonia (CAP), meningitis and bacteraemia over a 2 year period. Pneumococcus strains were identified. Isolates were tested against a panel of antibiotics using E-test strips, and interpreted according to the CLSI criteria. 0.06 \u03bcg/ml was used as break point for penicillin. Analysis was carried out using descriptive statistics; relationships determined using chi-squared or Fisher\"s exact tests, with P < 0.05 regarded as significant.\n\nTotal number of isolates was 132. Twenty-two (16.7%) of the isolates were fully sensitive to penicillin while 73 (55.3%) and 37 (28.0%) were intermediately and fully resistant, respectively. One hundred and twenty-seven (96.2%) of the isolates were fully resistant to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole. Eleven (8.5%) were fully resistant to amoxicillin and 104 (78.8%) and 17 (12.9%) were intermediately resistant and fully susceptible. One hundred and six (80.3%) of the isolates were fully susceptible to chloramphenicol. Resistance to penicillin was shown to infer resistance to other antibiotics.",
        "Breast cancer remains a major health problem worldwide, and is becoming increasingly resistant to traditional drug treatments. For instance, Adriamycin (ADR) is beneficial for the treatment of breast cancer. However, its wide application often leads to drug resistance in clinic practice, which results in treatment failure. Gambogenic acid (GNA), a polyprenylated xanthone isolated from the traditional medicine gamboge, has been reported to effectively inhibit the survival and proliferation of cancer cells. Its effects on ADR resistance have not yet been reported in breast cancer. In this study, we examined the ability of GNA to modulate ADR resiatance and the molecular mechanisms underlying this process using a cell based in vitro system.\n\nAn MTT assay was used to evaluate the inhibitory effect of the drugs on the growth of MCF-7 and MCF-7/ADR cell lines. The effects of drugs on apoptosis were detected using Annexin-V APC/7-AAD double staining. The expression of apoptosis-related proteins and the proteins in the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway were evaluated by Western blot analysis.\n\nIn the MCF-7/ADR cell lines, the IC50 (half maximal inhibitory concentration) of the group that received combined treatment with GNA and ADR was significantly lower than that in the ADR group, and this value decreased with an increasing concentration of GNA. In parallel, GNA treatment increased the chemosensitivity of breast cancer cells to ADR. The cell apoptosis and cell cycle anaysis indicated that the anti-proliferative effect of GNA is in virtue of increased G0/G1 arrest and potentiated apoptosis. When combined with GNA in MCF-7/ADR cell lines, the expression levels of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten) and the apoptosis-related proteins caspase-3 and capsese-9 were significantly increased, while the expression of phosphorylated AKT was decreased.",
        "The influence of gastric Helicobacter pylori infection on the development of oral pathoses remains unclear. The aim of this study is to examine the influence of gastric H. pylori infection on occurrence of halitosis and coated tongue.\n\nNinety-eight patients with dyspepsia were included in the study and their salivary samples and gastric biopsies were analyzed for the presence of H. pylori by Nested-PCR. Halitosis and coated tongue were assessed at the initial examination and 3 months after systemic eradication therapy against H. pylori.\n\nGastric biopsies of 66 patients were positive for H. pylori. Only one saliva sample was H. pylori positive. At initial examination, halitosis was observed in 20 patients (30.3%) out of 66 who had gastric H. pylori infection and in only 3 patients (9.4%) out of 32 without H. pylori infection (p = 0.0236). Coated tongue was diagnosed in 18 (27.2%) patients with the infection compared to only 2 (6.25%) patients negative for gastric H. pylori (p = 0.0164). Patients with gastric infection were treated with the triple eradication therapy (Amoxicillin, Clarythromycin, Pantoprazol) and their gastric biopsies and oral status were examined 3 months later. Halitosis was significantly more prevalent in the group of patients with persistent H. pylori infection (42.1%) compared to only 6.4% of patients in the group where infection was successfully eradicated (p = 0.0012). Coated tongue was diagnosed in 47.4% of patients where H. pylori was still present after eradication therapy and in only 6.4% where eradication succeeded (p = 0.0003).",
        "To observe the expression of nuclear protein 1 (Nupr1), a stress-related nuclear protein, in a panel of human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines, and its effects on the proliferation and migration of hepatocellular carcinoma cells by RNA interference-mediated knockdown.\n\nReal-time quantitative PCR was employed to detect Nupr1 mRNA levels in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines, including BEL-7402, QSG-7703, SMMC-7721 and HepG2. After Nupr1 expression was knocked down by RNA interference, cell proliferation was monitored by MTT assay and colony formation in plate. Cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry and cell migration was assayed by TranswellTM assay.\n\nHigher expression of Nupr1 was detected in HepG2 as compared with the other cell lines. Nupr1 expression in HepG2 cells were efficiently knocked down by two short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), with inhibitory rates being 72.25% and 84.25%, respectively. HepG2 cells with Nupr1 knockdown displayed lower rate of proliferation, G1 arrest, and significantly decreased abilities of cell migration and colony formation. Western blotting showed that Nupr1 knockdown increased the expressions of p21 and p27, two negative regulators of cell cycle.",
        "To study the effect of Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) on the immune function of spleen and thymus in SD rats.\n\nForty SD rats were randomly divided into four groups (10 rats each group). Three experimental groups were given GBE daily by gavage in doses of 40, 120, 360 mg/(kg.d), respectively. Animals in the control group were fed the same amount of PBS. After 28 days, the rats were sacrificed by chloral hydrate anesthesia. The spleen and thymus were harvested to determine the organ index first. MTT assay was used to detect the concanavalin A (ConA)-induced splenic lymphocyte proliferation and transformation. Neutral red assay was performed to measure the rat peritoneal macrophage phagocytosis. The ultrastructural changes of spleen and thymus were observed under scanning electron microscope.\n\nAdministration of GBE in the rats increased the mass indexes of rat thymus and spleen, dose-dependently elevated the lymphocyte proliferative responses and enhanced the peritoneal macrophage phagocytosis. In experimental groups, the numbers of mature spleen and thymus lymphocytes were significantly raised in comparison with the control rats.",

This novel indication for vaginal bilateral cervix suture may be a useful adjunct to intrauterine balloon tamponade in the management of postpartum hemorrhage.\n\nTo describe an effective, minimally invasive surgical technique for avoiding intrauterine balloon tamponade prolapse.\n\nThis procedure was performed in the delivery room with or without bladder retraction. The cervix was grasped with two ring forceps and firmly pulled outward, two cm horizontal suture of the cervical lips was made at both the three and nine o\"clock positions, which were placed two cm as close to the cervix external os, without transversing the cervicovesical reflection anteriorly and the pouch of Douglas posteriorly, then one or more Foley catheters were inserted through the cervix and inflated with saline 60-80 ml each.\n\nThe balloons remained in place and hemorrhage abated in all nine cases.",
        "Cystathionine-\u03b3-lyase (CSE)-derived hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a potent cardioprotective agent. We investigated the effects of diallyl trisulfide (DATS) on CSE expression and H2S generation in myocardium and examined whether DATS-mediated H2S generation effectively protects rat heart from diabetes-induced cardiac damage.\n\nThe correlations between the effects of hyperglycemia and diabetes on CSE expression and the effects of DATS and H2S on hyperglycemia and diabetes were examined in vitro in the cardiomyocyte cell line H9c2 and in vivo in hearts from rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus (DM).\n\nExpression of CSE, a catalyst of H2S production, was suppressed in H9c2 cells treated with high glucose (33 mM) and in DM rat hearts. CSE suppression also correlated with a decrease in the activation of the pro-survival protein kinase Akt. Treatment of H9c2 cells with DATS resulted in increased CSE expression and a reduction in apoptosis via a mechanism involving IGF1R/pAkt signaling and by modulating the expression of reactive oxygen species-related enzymes. The role CSE plays in the cardioprotective effects of DATS was further confirmed by CSE inhibition assays including inhibitors and siRNA.",
        "Telomere length and telomerase activity are important indicators of cellular senescence and replicative ability. Loss of telomerase is associated with ageing and the development of osteoarthritis. Implantation of telomerase-positive cells, chondrocytes, or stem cells expressing a normal chondrocyte phenotype is desired for cartilage repair procedures. The objective of this study was to identify at what age chondrocytes and at what passage bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) become senescent based on telomerase activity. The effect of osteogenic protein-1 (OP-1) or interleukin-1\u03b1 (IL-1\u03b1) treatment on telomerase activity in chondrocytes was also measured to determine the response to anabolic or catabolic stimuli.\n\nArticular cartilage was collected from horses (n = 12) aged 1 month to 18 years. Chondrocytes from prepubescent horses (<15 months) were treated with OP-1 or IL-1\u03b1. Bone marrow aspirate from adult horses was collected and cultured for up to 10 days to isolate MSCs. Telomerase activity was measured using the TeloTAGGG Telomerase PCR ELISA kit.\n\nChondrocytes from prepubescent horses were positive for telomerase activity. Treatment with IL-1\u03b1 resulted in a decrease in chondrocyte telomerase activity; however, treatment with OP-1 did not change telomerase activity. One MSC culture sample was positive for telomerase activity on day 2; all samples were negative for telomerase activity on day 10.",
        "To explore the mechanisms of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs)on promoting osteogenic differentiation of marrow stromal cells (MSCs).\n\nEPCs and MSCs were isolated and cultured successfully from C57BL/7 murine bone marrow by in vitro amplification. EPC-conditioned medium (CM) was extracted to detect the concentrations of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF\u03b21), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). After 14 days of induction, alizarin red staining was used to detect every group\"s calcium salt deposition. And analyses were conducted for the effects of above mentioned antibodies of cytokines on osteogenic differentiation of MSCs.\n\nPositive rates of EPCs were 79.3%, 79.5%, 76.4% for VEGFR2, CD34 and CD133 respectively, and EPCs could form tube-like structure on matrigel. EPCs secreted VEGF, TGF\u03b21, PDGF, IGF-1, SDF-1 and bFGF. MSC/EPC group formed more mineralized nodules than MSC group, and semi-quantitative results showed the optical density of MSC/EPC group was higher than that of MSC group (0.733 \u00b1 0.032 vs 0.236 \u00b1 0.020, P < 0.001). The number of formed mineralized nodules of 50% EPC-CM group were more than those of 25% EPC-CM group, and semi-quantitative results showed that the optical density of 50% EPC-CM group was higher than that of 25% EPC-CM group (0.637 \u00b1 0.028 vs 0.336 \u00b1 0.024, P < 0.001), the number of formed mineralized nodules of 25% EPC-CM group were more than those of 0 EPC-CM group, and semi-quantitative results showed that the optical density of 25% EPC-CM group was higher than that of 0 EPC-CM group (0.336 \u00b1 0.024 vs 0.239 \u00b1 0.013, P = 0.004).

        "Previous studies investigating the relationship between sleep duration and cognitive function in older adults have suggested that longer sleep durations are associated with decreased cognitive performance.\n\nThe intent of this study is to determine if performance on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) is associated with self-reported sleep duration in older adults.\n\nData from 189 cognitively normal older adults aged 75 and older (mean age 89.29\\xa0\u00b1\\xa07.62) and free of severe depression were used for this analysis. Individuals were grouped based on their self-reported hours of sleep (short duration\\xa0=\\xa0<7, normal duration\\xa0=\\xa07, >9, and long duration\\xa0=\\xa0\u22659). The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to discern group differences on the MoCA scores, while multinomial logistic regression was used to assess the association between MoCA and MMSE scores and sleep group.\n\nThe long duration group had significantly lower MoCA scores than the normal duration group (p\\xa0=\\xa00.02). The short duration group was not significantly different from the normal duration group (p\\xa0=\\xa00.33).

        "This study investigates the effect of spectral loudness summation (SLS) in the electrical domain as perceived by cochlear implant (CI) users. Analogous to SLS in the acoustical domain, SLS was defined as the effect of electrode separation at a fixed overall stimulation rate.\n\nCategorical loudness scaling (CLS) was conducted at three overall stimulation rates using single-electrode stimuli and multi-electrode stimuli presented interleaved on two or four electrodes. The specific loudness of the pulses in the multi-electrode stimuli were equalized based on single-electrode measurements at the same overall stimulation rate. At a fixed overall stimulation rate and a fixed loudness perception, SLS was calculated as the difference in mean current between single-electrode and multi-electrode stimuli.\n\nTen postlingually deafened adult CI users.\n\nThe amount of SLS varied between subjects and between the number and location of the stimulated electrodes in the multi-electrode configuration. SLS was significantly higher than 0 for a subset of the subjects.",

There was no difference in the number of patients diagnosed with the B- and 2012-criteria. Therefore, they are mentioned as one. Forty-seven patients (75 %) were diagnosed with SRBD using the A-criteria versus 57 patients (90 %) using the B/2012-criteria (p\\u2009<\\u20090.0016). In 30 cases, a change from A- to B/2012-criteria resulted in a change in diagnosis. Ten cases of \"no SRBD\" changed to mild/moderate/severe SRBD. An apnea hypopnea index (AHI) >15 is a typical indication of treatment. With the B/2012-criteria, we found an additional indication of treatment in 18 patients, compared to when the A-criteria were applied (p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001). Two of these patients were labeled as no SRBD with the A-criteria.",
        "Learning from adverse events and near misses may reduce the incidence of preventable errors. Current literature on adverse events and near misses in the ICU focuses on errors reported by nurses and intensivists. ICU near misses identified by anesthesia providers may reveal critical events, causal mechanisms and system weaknesses not identified by other providers, and may differ in character and causality from near misses in other anesthesia locations.\n\nWe analyzed events reported to our anesthesia near miss reporting system from 2009 to 2011. We compared causative mechanisms of ICU near misses with near misses in other anesthesia locations.\n\nA total of 1,811 near misses were reported, of which 22 (1.2 %) originated in the ICU. Five causal mechanisms explained over half of ICU near misses. Compared to near misses from other locations, near misses from the ICU were more likely to occur while on call (45 % vs. 19 %, p\\u2009=\\u20090.001), and were more likely to be associated with airway management (50 % vs. 12 %, p\\u2009<\\u20090.001).

        "We previously showed that subsequent intrathecal (i.t.) injection of resveratrol (30\\xa0\u03bcg) significantly reverses morphine-evoked neuroinflammation in morphine-tolerant rats. The present study examined the underlying mechanism.\n\nMale Wistar rats were implanted with two i.t. catheters, one of which was connected to a miniosmotic pump and used for morphine (15\\xa0\u03bcg/h) or saline infusion for 120 hours. To examine the effects on spinal cord expression of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), and TNF receptor (TNFR) 1 and TNFR2 during tolerance induction, a tail-flick test was performed prior to infusion and after 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours, 96 hours, and 120 hours of infusion.\n\nResveratrol treatment prior to morphine challenge restored the antinociceptive effect of morphine in morphine-tolerant rats and reversed the morphine infusion-induced increase in HDAC1, TNF-\u03b1, and TNFR1 expression. Moreover, chronic morphine infusion increased TNFR1-specific expression in neuron in morphine-tolerant rat spinal cords, and this effect was almost completely inhibited by resveratrol treatment prior to morphine challenge.",
        "Clusterin/apolipoprotein J (apoJ) circulates in blood in part associated to lipoproteins or in unbound form. When bound to HDL, apoJ is antiatherogenic by inhibiting endothelial cell apoptosis; thus, any factor modifying apoJ association to HDL would decrease its antiatherogenic function. However, the exact distribution of apoJ in each lipoprotein fraction, or in lipoprotein-non bound form has not been specifically investigated either in normolipemia or in dyslipemia.\n\nBasic lipid profile and apoJ concentration were determined in sera from 70 subjects, including a wide range of cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations. Lipoproteins were isolated by ultracentrifugation and their lipid and apolipoprotein composition was assessed.\n\nIn the overall population, serum apoJ positively associated with cholesterol, triglyceride and VLDL-C concentrations, and HDL-C and triglyceride were independent predictors of increased apoJ concentration. Approximately, 20.5% of circulating apoJ was associated with lipoproteins (18.5% HDL, 0.9% LDL and 1.1% VLDL) and 79.5% was not bound to lipoproteins. Serum apoJ concentration was higher in hypercholesterolemic (HC), hypertriglyceridemic (HTG) and combined hyperlipidemic (CHL) sera compared to normolipemic (NL) sera (HC, 98.15\\xa0\u00b1\\xa033.6\\xa0mg/L; HTG, 103.3\\xa0\u00b1\\xa036.8\\xa0mg/L; CHL, 131.7\\xa0\u00b1\\xa026.8\\xa0mg/L; NL, 66.7\\xa0\u00b1\\xa033.8\\xa0mg/L; P\\xa0<\\xa00.001).

        "To observe the role of autophagy in maintaining diabetic neuropathic pain in rats model.\n\nA total of 44 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into diabetic neuropathic (n = 36) and normal control (n = 8) groups. Diabetes was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) (60 mg/kg body weight, i.p) freshly dissolved in citrate buffer (pH = 4.5). For assessing the presence of mechanical hyperalgesia in diabetic rats, mechanical paw-withdrawal threshold (MWT) in response to punctuate mechanical stimuli was measured. At Week 4 post-injection, the rats with mechanical pain threshold decreasing over 50% as compared to baseline were designated as diabetic neuropathic pain rats. They were randomly divided into three groups of neuropathic pain (DP), neuropathic pain plus rapamycin (DR) and neuropathic pain plus 3-methyladenine (3-MA) (DA). The DR group received an intraperitoneal injection of rapamycin (1 mg/kg body weight) for Day 1 to Day 14 after grouping. At the same timepoint, the DA group had an intraperitoneal injection of 3-MA (2 mg/kg body weight) and the other group phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (1 ml/kg body weight). MWT was measured at week 1, 2, 3, 4 after STZ injection and at day 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 14 after rapamycin, 3-MA or PBS injections. Spinal cord tissues were used to examine the expression of LC3, Beclin-1 and P62 protein by Western blot at Day 14 after medication.\n\nThe mechanical threshold of group DR decreased further from Day 3 to Day 14 after rapamycin injection compared to baseline [(4.8\u00b10.8), (4.3\u00b10.7), (4.1\u00b10.6), (3.6\u00b10.5), (3.3\u00b10.6) vs (5.3\u00b10.9) g, P<0.05]. The mechanical threshold of group DA began to increase from Day 5 to Day 14 after 3-MA injection [(7.0\u00b10.8), (7.7\u00b11.0), (9.1\u00b10.9), (9.6\u00b11.1) vs (5.3\u00b10.6) g, P<0.05].

Histological examinations were performed to monitor disease progression after haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of articular cartilage. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect IL-1Ra and TGF-\u03b21 in synovial membrane tissues. Exogenous IL-1Ra and TGF-\u03b21 content was assessed in joint lavage fluid using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).\n\nELISA measurements from the joint lavage fluid showed high expressions of IL-1Ra and TGF-\u03b21 in the single and double transfection groups. Remarkably, concomitant reductions in IL-1\u03b2 and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) levels were observed in these single and double transfection groups. Radioimmunoassay (RIA)-based detection showed that IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 levels in the gene transfection groups were significantly lower compared to the blank control group, in parallel experiments. Importantly, injection of IL-1Ra and TGF-\u03b21 expressing cartilage cells into joints led to a significant inhibition of cartilage matrix degradation. Finally, IL-1Ra and TGF-\u03b21 expression in tissues correlated with disease reversal in the experimental group, with improved tissue architecture and collagen deposition.",
        "Osteochondral graft transplantation has garnered significant attention because of its ability to replace the lesion with true hyaline cartilage. However, surgical impaction of the graft to anchor it into the defect site can be traumatic and lead to cell death and cartilage degeneration. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that increasing impulse magnitude during impaction of osteochondral plugs has a direct effect on loss of cell viability.\n\nIn this controlled laboratory study, the impaction force was kept constant while the impulse was varied. Ninety-six osteochondral plugs were extracted from the trochlea of bovine stifle joints and were randomly assigned into 3 experimental and 1 (nonimpacted) control group. The transferred impulse of the experimental groups reflected the median and the lower and upper quartiles of preceding clinical measurements. Data were obtained at day 0, day 4, and day 8; at each point, cell viability was assessed using the Live/Dead staining kit and histological assessments were performed to visualize matrix structural changes.\n\nAfter impaction, cartilage samples stayed intact and did not show any histological signs of matrix disruption. As expected, higher impulse magnitudes introduced more cell death; however, this relationship was lost at day 8 after impaction.",
        "Many processes are deregulated in melanoma cells and one of those is protein production. Although much is known about protein synthesis in cancer cells, effective ways of therapeutically targeting this process remain an understudied area of research. A process that is upregulated in melanoma compared with normal melanocytes is proline biosynthesis, which has been linked to both oncogene and tumor suppressor pathways, suggesting an important convergent point for therapeutic intervention. Therefore, an RNAi screen of a kinase library was undertaken, identifying aldehyde dehydrogenase 18 family, member A1 (ALDH18A1) as a critically important gene in regulating melanoma cell growth through proline biosynthesis. Inhibition of ALDH18A1, the gene encoding pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (P5CS), significantly decreased cultured melanoma cell viability and tumor growth. Knockdown of P5CS using siRNA had no effect on apoptosis, autophagy, or the cell cycle but cell-doubling time increased dramatically suggesting that there was a general slowdown in cellular metabolism. Mechanistically, targeting ALDH18A1 activated the serine/threonine protein kinase GCN2 (general control nonderepressible 2) to inhibit protein synthesis, which could be reversed with proline supplementation. Thus, targeting ALDH18A1 in melanoma can be used to disrupt proline biosynthesis to limit cell metabolism thereby increasing the cellular doubling time mediated through the GCN2 pathway.",
        "With the recent discovery of recurrent mutations in the TERT promoter in melanoma, identification of other somatic causal promoter mutations is of considerable interest. Yet, the impact of sequence variation on the regulatory potential of gene promoters has not been systematically evaluated. This study assesses the impact of promoter mutations on promoter activity in the whole-genome sequenced malignant melanoma cell line COLO-829. Combining somatic mutation calls from COLO-829 with genome-wide chromatin accessibility and histone modification data revealed mutations within promoter elements. Interestingly, a high number of potential promoter mutations (n = 23) were found, a result mirrored in subsequent analysis of TCGA whole-melanoma genomes. The impact of wild-type and mutant promoter sequences were evaluated by subcloning into luciferase reporter vectors and testing their transcriptional activity in COLO-829 cells. Of the 23 promoter regions tested, four mutations significantly altered reporter activity relative to wild-type sequences. These data were then subjected to multiple computational algorithms that score the cis-regulatory altering potential of mutations. These analyses identified one mutation, located within the promoter region of NDUFB9, which encodes the mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) 1 beta subcomplex 9, to be recurrent in 4.4% (19 of 432) of TCGA whole-melanoma exomes. The mutation is predicted to disrupt a highly conserved SP1/KLF transcription factor binding motif and its frequent co-occurrence with mutations in the coding sequence of NF1 supports a pathologic role for this mutation in melanoma. Taken together, these data show the relatively high prevalence of promoter mutations in the COLO-829 melanoma genome, and indicate that a proportion of these significantly alter the regulatory potential of gene promoters.",
        "Complementing infant diets with lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNSs) has been suggested to improve growth and reduce morbidity, but the daily quantity and the milk content of LNSs affect their cost.\n\nWe tested the hypotheses that the change in mean length-for-age z score (LAZ) for infants provided with 10-40 g LNSs/d from ages 6 to 18 mo would be greater than that for infants receiving no dietary intervention at the same age and that provision of LNSs that did not contain milk would be as good as milk-containing LNSs in promoting linear growth.\n\nWe enrolled in a randomized single-blind trial 6-mo-old infants who were allocated to 1 of 6 groups to receive 10, 20, or 40 g LNSs/d containing milk powder; 20 or 40 g milk-free LNSs/d; or no supplement until 18 mo of age. The primary outcome was change in LAZ.\n\nOf the 1932 enrolled infants, 78 (4.0%) died and 319 (16.5%) dropped out during the trial. The overall reported supplement consumption was 71.6% of days, with no difference between the groups (P = 0.26). The overall mean \u00b1 SD length and LAZ changes were 13.0 \u00b1 2.1 cm and -0.45 \u00b1 0.77 z score units, respectively, which did not differ between the groups (P = 0.66 for length and P = 0.74 for LAZ). The difference in mean LAZ change in the no-milk LNS group compared with the milk LNS group was -0.02 (95% CI: -0.10, 0.06; P = 0.72).",
        "Dietary intakes of betaine and choline may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease; however, epidemiologic evidence is limited. Seafood is a rich source of betaine and is a popular traditional food in Japan.\n\nWe examined the associations of betaine and choline intakes with cardiovascular disease mortality in a population-based cohort study in Japan.\n\nStudy subjects were 13,355 male and 15,724 female residents of Takayama City, Japan, who were aged \u226535 y and enrolled in 1992. Their diets were assessed by a validated food frequency questionnaire. Deaths from coronary heart disease and stroke were identified from death certificates over 16 y. Multivariable-adjusted HRs were computed by using Cox regression models.\n\nDuring follow-up, we documented 308 deaths from coronary heart disease and 676 deaths from stroke (393 from ischemic and 153 from hemorrhagic strokes). Compared with the lowest quartile, the second, third, and highest quartiles of betaine intake were significantly associated with a decreased risk of mortality from coronary heart disease in men after controlling for covariates. The HRs were 0.58 (95% CI: 0.36, 0.93), 0.62 (95% CI: 0.39, 0.998), and 0.60 (95% CI: 0.37, 0.97), respectively. The trend was not statistically significant (P = 0.08). There was no significant association between betaine intake and the risk of mortality from ischemic stroke. In women, betaine intake was unrelated risk of mortality from coronary heart disease and stroke (P = 0.32 and 0.73, respectively, for interaction by sex). There was no significant association between choline intake and cardiovascular disease mortality risk in men or women.",
        "Furosemide is a loop diuretic, which blocks the Na(+), K(+), 2Cl(-) cotransporter (NKCC2) in the thick ascending limb of Henle (TAL). By diminishing sodium (Na(+)) reabsorption, loop diuretics reduce the lumen-positive transepithelial voltage and consequently diminish paracellular transport of magnesium (Mg(2+)) and calcium (Ca(2+)) in TAL. Indeed, furosemide promotes urinary Mg(2+) excretion; however, it is unclear whether this leads, especially during prolonged treatment, to hypomagnesaemia. The aim of the present study was, therefore, to determine the effect of chronic furosemide application on renal Mg(2+) handling in mice.\n\nTwo groups of 10 mice received an osmotic minipump subcutaneously for 7 days with vehicle or 30 mg/kg/day furosemide. Serum and urine electrolyte concentrations were determined. Next, renal mRNA levels of the epithelial Mg(2+) channel (TRPM6), the Na(+), Cl(-) cotransporter (NCC), the epithelial Ca(2+) channel (TRPV5), the cytosolic Ca(2+)-binding protein calbindin-D28K, as well parvalbumin (PV), claudin-7 (CLDN7) and claudin-8 (CLDN8), the epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC) and the Na(+)-H(+) exchanger 3 (NHE3) were determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Renal protein levels of NCC, TRPV5, calbindin-D28K and ENaC were also measured using semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting.\n\nThe mice chronically treated with 30 mg/kg/day furosemide displayed a significant polyuria (2.1 \u00b1 0.3 and 1.3 \u00b1 0.2 mL/24 h, furosemide versus control respectively, P < 0.05). Furosemide treatment resulted in increased serum concentrations of Na(+) [158 \u00b1 3 (treated) and 147 \u00b1 1 mmol/L (control), P < 0.01], whereas serum K(+), Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) values were not significantly altered in mice treated with furosemide. Urinary excretion of Na(+), K(+), Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) was not affected by chronic furosemide treatment. The present study shows specific renal upregulation of TRPM6, NCC, TRPV5 and calbindin-D28K.",
        "Symptoms compatible with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are common in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) in clinical remission. It has been suggested that these symptoms might arise due to post-inflammatory changes comparable with post-infectious IBS. The aim was to study factors at new onset of UC that predict development of IBS-like symptoms during clinical remission.\n\nIn total, 98 patients with new onset of UC were followed prospectively for 3 years with yearly follow-up visits. Data from the first visit at the onset of UC were compared between a group of patients who fulfilled the criteria for IBS while in remission (UCR+IBS) during follow-up and a group who did not (UCR-IBS).\n\nAmong the UC patients, 87 met the criteria for clinical remission and 25 (29%) of these reported IBS-like symptoms in remission during follow-up. There was no difference in inflammatory disease activity at the initial flare or in the prevalence of previous IBS symptoms when comparing UCR+IBS and UCR-IBS patients. The UCR+IBS patients reported more severe gastrointestinal symptoms, including abdominal pain, during their primary flare.",
        "It is well known that expression of markers for WNT signaling is dysregulated in osteoarthritic (OA) bone. However, it is still not fully known if the expression of these markers also is affected in OA cartilage. The aim of this study was therefore to examine this issue.\n\nHuman cartilage biopsies from OA and control donors were subjected to genome-wide oligonucleotide microarrays. Genes involved in WNT signaling were selected using the BioRetis database, KEGG pathway analysis was searched using DAVID software tools, and cluster analysis was performed using Genesis software. Results from the microarray analysis were verified using quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry. In order to study the impact of cytokines for the dysregulated WNT signaling, OA and control chondrocytes were stimulated with interleukin-1 and analyzed with real-time PCR for their expression of WNT-related genes.\n\nSeveral WNT markers displayed a significantly altered expression in OA compared to normal cartilage. Interestingly, inhibitors of the canonical and planar cell polarity WNT signaling pathways displayed significantly increased expression in OA cartilage, while the Ca(2+)/WNT signaling pathway was activated. Both real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry verified the microarray results. Real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that interleukin-1 upregulated expression of important WNT markers.",
        "The Glasgow prognostic score (GPS) determined at pretreatment is important in the prediction of prognosis in various cancers. We investigated if the GPS used both at pretreatment and during concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) could predict the prognosis of patients with cervical cancer.\n\nWe collected GPS and clinicopathological data from the medical records of 91 patients who underwent CCRT for cervical cancer; their GPSs at pretreatment and during CCRT were retrospectively analyzed for correlations with recurrence and survival. Statistical analyses were performed using the Mann-Whitney U test. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox\"s proportional hazard regression was used for univariate and multivariate analyses.\n\nThe median follow-up for all patients who were alive at the time of last follow-up was 38.0 months (range, 1-108 months). The DFS and OS rates of patients with a high GPS during CCRT (GPS 1 + 2; 55 patients; 60.4%) were significantly shorter than those for patients with a low GPS (GPS 0; 36 patients; 39.6%) (DFS, P < 0.001; OS, P < 0.001). Furthermore, multivariate analyses showed that high GPS during CCRT was an independent prognostic factor of survival for OS (P = 0.008).",
        "The prognostic significance of lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) in patients with early-stage endometrial cancer is not established. We sought to determine if LVSI status in patients with early-stage low-risk endometrial cancer correlates with recurrence and survival.\n\nThe records of all women who underwent hysterectomy for primary treatment of endometrial cancer from January 2006 through January 2011 at 1 academic institution were reviewed. Patients with grade 1 or 2 endometrioid histology, myometrial invasion less than 50%, and disease confined to the uterus (clinical International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynecology stage IA) were analyzed. Fisher exact test and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test were applied to compare patients with and without LVSI. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.\n\nTwo hundred forty patients met the inclusion criteria. Forty (16.7%) had LVSI. Ninety-one patients (37.9%) underwent lymphadenectomy. Median tumor size was 30 mm in patients with and 26 mm in patients without LVSI (P = 0.150). Thirty patients (12.5%) received adjuvant therapy. Site of recurrence did not differ between patients with and without LVSI. Patients with LVSI were more likely to have myometrial invasion (P < 0.001), postoperative pathologic grade 2 disease (P < 0.001), to undergo lymphadenectomy (P = 0.049) and receive adjuvant therapy (P < 0.001). The 5-year cumulative incidence of recurrence was 3.8% in the no-LVSI group and 14.2% in the LVSI group (P = 0.053). The presence of LVSI was significantly associated with worse RFS (P = 0.002) and OS (P = 0.013).",
        "Chironomus ramosus is one of the recently reported radiotolerant insects. Salivary gland cells of fourth instar larvae respond to ionizing radiations with increases in the levels of antioxidant enzymes and chaperone proteins. Here we made an attempt to study the state of nuclear DNA after exposure of larvae to a lethal dose for 20% of the population (LD(20)) of gamma radiation (2200 Gy, at a dose rate 5.5 Gy/min).\n\nGenomic DNA preparations were subjected to competitive ELISA (Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) for detection of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2\"-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) to monitor any radiation-induced damage. Single salivary gland cells were subjected to alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis (ASCGE), comet assay and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to check for DNA double-strand breaks.\n\nResults from all four experimental procedures confirmed damage of nucleobases and fragmentation of nuclear DNA immediately after radiation. Some 48 h after radiation exposure, modified 8-oxodG residues returned to basal level, homodispersity of genomic DNA reappeared, the length of comet tail regressed significantly (ASCGE) and PFGE pattern matched with that of high molecular weight unirradiated DNA.",

        "Renal insufficiency (RI) is frequent in patients eligible for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) and may be worsened by the use of contrast agents. We sought to determine the feasibility of CRT implantation without contrast injection in patients with contraindication to iodine.\n\nPatients eligible for CRT and presenting with RI were prospectively included (non-contrast NC group). A contemporary control group (CG) of CRT patients with contrast injection was used for comparison. An over-the-wire coronary sinus (CS) lead with an angled distal tip was selected for this \"blind harpooning\" technique.\n\nSeventeen patients in the NC group were included (78 \u00b1 7 years). Serum creatinine was 208 \u00b1 86 \u03bcmol/L (glomerular filtration rate 33 \u00b1 15 mL/min/1.73 m(2)). CG included 25 patients (70 \u00b1 7 years, serum creatinine 85 \u00b1 21 \u03bcmol/L). CRT implantation was successful in 16/17 patients (94.1 %) without contrast injection. The mean procedure and fluoroscopy times were similar in the two groups: 146 \u00b1 29 in the NC group versus 153 \u00b1 25 min (p = 0.57) and 25 \u00b1 12 in the NC group versus 23 \u00b1 16 min (p = 0.7) respectively.

        "\u03b2-Thalassemia is a common inherited red cell disorder characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis and severe oxidative stress. Peroxiredoxin-2 (Prx2), a typical 2-cysteine peroxiredoxin, is upregulated during \u03b2-thalassemic erythropoiesis, but its contribution to stress erythropoiesis, a common feature of thalassemia, is yet to be fully defined.\n\nHere, we showed that Prx2(-/-) mice displayed reactive oxygen species related abnormalities in erythropoiesis similar to that of Hbb(th3/+) mice associated with activation of redox response transcriptional factor nuclear factor-erythroid 2 (Nrf2). We generated \u03b2-thalassemic mice genetically lacking Prx2 (Prx2(-/-)Hbb(th3/+)) and documented a worsened \u03b2-thalassemic hematological phenotype with severe ineffective erythropoiesis. To further validate a key role of Prx2 in stress erythropoiesis, we administrated fused recombinant PEP1Prx2 to Hbb(th3/+) mice and documented a decrease in ineffective erythropoiesis. We further show that Prx2 effects are mediated by activation of Nrf2 and upregulation of genes that protect against oxidative damage such as gluthatione S-transferase, heme-oxygenase-1, and NADPH dehydrogenase quinone-1.\n\nWe propose Prx2 as a key antioxidant system and Nrf2 activation is a cellular adaptive process in response to oxidative stress, resulting in upregulation of antioxidant (antioxidant responsive element) genes required to ensure cell survival.",
        "The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway regulates immune responses, and promotes cell growth and differentiation. Inhibition of mTOR with rapamycin modulates allergic asthma, while the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that rapamycin, effectively inhibits eosinophil differentiation, contributing to its overall protective role in allergic airway inflammation.\n\nRapamycin was administered in a mouse model of ovalbumin-induced allergic airway inflammation, and the eosinophil differentiation was analysed in vivo and in vitro.\n\nRapamycin significantly attenuated allergic airway inflammation and markedly decreased the amount of eosinophils in local airways, peripheral blood and bone marrow, independently of levels of interleukin-5 (IL-5). In vitro colony forming unit assay and liquid culture demonstrated that rapamycin directly inhibited IL-5-induced eosinophil differentiation. In addition, rapamycin reduced the production of IL-6 and IL-13 by eosinophils. Rapamycin was also capable of reducing the eosinophil levels in IL-5 transgenic NJ.1638 mice, again regardless of the constitutive high levels of IL-5. Interestingly, rapamycin inhibition of eosinophil differentiation in turn resulted in an accumulation of eosinophil lineage-committed progenitors in bone marrow.",

        "Apoptosis of chondrocytes in articular cartilage has been observed in rheumatoid arthritis patients. However, molecules involved in such chondrocyte apoptosis in arthritic joints have not been fully understood. We previously observed that apoptosis of chondrocytes is enhanced in a murine arthritis model induced by injection with anti-type II collagen antibodies and lipopolysaccharide (mAbs/LPS), and osteopontin (OPN) deficiency suppresses chondrocyte apoptosis in this arthritis model in vivo. To understand how OPN deficiency renders resistance against chondrocyte apoptosis, we examined the cellular basis for this protection.\n\nChondrocytes were prepared from wild-type and OPN-deficient mouse ribs, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1-induced cell death was examined based on lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay and TUNEL assay.\n\nTNF-\u03b1 treatment induced LDH release in wild-type chondrocytes, while OPN deficiency suppressed such LDH release in the cultures of these cells. TNF-\u03b1-induced increase in the number of TUNEL-positive cells was observed in wild-type chondrocytes, while OPN deficiency in chondrocytes suppressed the TNF-\u03b1 induction of TUNEL-positive cells.

        "Urothelial carcinoma (UC) is the most common tumor involving upper urinary tract (UTUC) and urinary bladder (UBUC) whose molecular survival determinants remains obscured. By computerizing a public transcriptomic database of UBUCs (GSE32894), we identified cell division cycle associated 5 (CDCA5) as the most significantly upregulated gene among those associated with G1-S transition of the mitotic cell cycle (GO:0000082). We therefore analyzed the clinicoptaological significance of CDCA5 expression in our well-characterized UC cohort.\n\nQuantigene assay was used to detect CDCA5 transcript levels in 36 UTUCs and 30 UBUCs. We used immunohistochemistry evaluated by H-scores to determine CDCA5 protein expression in 295 UBUCs and 340 UTUCs, respectively. CDCA5 expression was further correlated with clinicopathological features and disease-specific survival (DSS) and metastasis-free survival (MeFS). For both groups of UCs, increments of CDCA5 transcript levels were associated with higher pT status, CDCA5 protein overexpression was also significantly associated with advanced pT status, nodal metastasis, high histological grade, vascular invasion, and frequent mitoses. CDCA5 overexpression was predictive for worse DSS and MeFS in univariate and multivariate analysis.",
        "Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is standard practice for intermediate-thickness head and neck melanoma (HNM) but remains controversial for melanomas more than 4 mm in thickness.

        "Hyperkinetic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a common complication in congenital heart disease, and affects operations, indications, and prognoses for patients. Gene-based stem cell transplantation is an alternative treatment that can attenuate PAH.\n\nHyperkinetic PAH rabbit models were successfully established, using common carotid artery and jugular vein anastomosis. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) were isolated from the bone marrow, cultured, and transfected with human hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (hHIF-1\u03b1), using lentiviruses. Two weeks after the transfected EPCs were transplanted into the rabbits, catheterization was applied to collect hemodynamic data. The hypertrophy of the right ventricle and pulmonary vascular remodeling were evaluated by measuring the right ventricle hypertrophy index, the medial wall thickness, and the medial wall area. Western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses were used to detect the expression of hHIF-1\u03b1 in the pulmonary small arteries.\n\nTwo weeks after transplantation, systolic pulmonary arterial pressure and mean pulmonary arterial pressure were both attenuated. The hypertrophy of the right ventricle, and pulmonary vascular remodeling were reversed. Expression of hHIF-1\u03b1 in the hHIF-1\u03b1-transfected EPCs that had been transplanted was high, and the number of pulmonary small arteries had increased. In addition, combined HIF-1\u03b1 and homogeneous EPC therapy was more effective at attenuating PAH and increasing the density of pulmonary small arteries, compared with EPC transplantation alone.",
        "White-to-brown adipose tissue remodeling (browning) in response to different stimuli constitutes an active research area for obesity treatment. The emergence in traditional white adipose tissue (WAT) depots of multilocular adipocytes that express uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and resemble brown adipocytes, the so called \"brite\" adipocytes, could contribute to increased energy expenditure. In rodents, obesogenic stimuli such as the intake of hyperlipidic diets can increase brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenic capacity and contribute to maintaining body weight. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of two different hyperlipidic diets, a commercial high-fat (HF) diet and a highly palatable cafeteria (CAF) diet, to induce WAT browning.\n\nWe analyzed gene expression of a wide number of brown/brite adipocyte markers in different WAT depots, in BAT and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) increasingly being used in nutrition studies as a potential source of biomarkers of physiological effects. We also performed morphological analysis of adipose tissue.\n\nBoth HF diets studied were able to increase the expression of the markers studied in WAT in a depot-specific manner, as well as in BAT; some of these changes were also reflected in PBMCs. This increased browning capacity was translated into the appearance of UCP1- and CIDE-A (cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector A)-positive brite adipocytes in retroperitoneal WAT. Administration of the CAF diet, associated with higher adiposity, produced the strongest impact on the parameters studied while its withdrawal restored basal conditions.",
        "The objective of this study is to describe the technical design and verify the technical performance of a new bone conduction implant (BCI) system.\n\nThe BCI consists of an external audio processor and an implanted unit called the bridging bone conductor. These two units use an inductive link to communicate with each other through the intact skin in order to drive an implanted transducer.\n\nIn this study, the design of the full BCI system has been described and verified on a skull simulator and on real patients.\n\nIt was found that the maximum output force (peak 107 dB re 1 \u03bcN) of the BCI is robust for skin thickness range of 2-8 mm and that the total harmonic distortion is below 8% in the speech frequency range for 70 dB input sound pressure level. The current consumption is 7.5 mA, which corresponds to 5-7 days use with a single battery.",
        "To examine the impact of visual cues, speech materials, age and listening condition on the frequency bandwidth necessary for optimizing speech recognition performance.\n\nUsing a randomized repeated measures design; speech recognition performance was assessed using four speech perception tests presented in quiet and noise in 13 LP filter conditions and presented in multimodalities. Participants\" performance data were fitted with a Boltzmann function to determine optimal performance (10% below performance achieved in FBW).\n\nThirty adults (18-63 years) and thirty children (7-12 years) with normal hearing.\n\nVisual cues significantly reduced the bandwidth required for optimizing speech recognition performance for listeners. The type of speech material significantly impacted the bandwidth required for optimizing performance. Both groups required significantly less bandwidth in quiet, although children required significantly more than adults. The widest bandwidth required was for the phoneme detection task in noise where children required a bandwidth of 7399 Hz and adults 6674 Hz.",
        "It was recently suggested that electron flow into cyt c, coupled with ROS generation, oxidizes cyt c Met(80) to Met(80) sulfoxide (Met-O) in isolated hearts after ischemia-reperfusion, and converts cyt c to a peroxidase. We hypothesize that ischemia disrupts Met(80)-Fe ligation of cyt c, forming pentacoordinated heme Fe(2+), which inhibits electron transport (ET) and promotes oxygenase activity.\n\nSS-20 (Phe-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH2) was used to demonstrate the role of Met(80)-Fe ligation in ischemia. Mitochondria were isolated from ischemic rat kidneys to determine sites of respiratory inhibition. Mitochondrial cyt c and cyt c Met-O were quantified by western blot, and cristae architecture was examined by electron microscopy.\n\nBiochemical and structural studies showed that SS-20 selectively targets cardiolipin (CL) and protects Met(80)-Fe ligation in cyt c. Ischemic mitochondria showed 17-fold increase in Met-O cyt c, and dramatic cristaeolysis. Loss of cyt c was associated with proteolytic degradation of OPA1. Ischemia significantly inhibited ET initiated by direct reduction of cyt c and coupled respiration. All changes were prevented by SS-20.",
        "CRH participates in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and in neural circuits involved in the pathophysiology of depression. During pregnancy, the placenta produces large amounts of CRH, and production ceases abruptly after delivery. The relationship between CRH in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during pregnancy and peripartum mood disorders has not been investigated.\n\nThe objectives were to determine whether there are differences in CSF CRH concentrations of pregnant and nonpregnant women and whether CSF CRH concentrations in late pregnancy are associated with the presence of depressive symptoms during pregnancy and in the early postpartum period.\n\nThis was a prospective cohort study conducted from January to April, 2011.\n\nThe study was conducted in one public and two private hospitals in Brasilia, Brazil.\n\nPatients included 107 healthy pregnant women who underwent elective cesarean delivery and 22 nonpregnant healthy women who underwent spinal anesthesia for elective surgical sterilization.\n\nCRH in CSF was measured in pregnant and nonpregnant women by ELISA.\n\nThe association between CSF CRH concentration at delivery and maternal depression assessed before cesarean section and postpartum (4 to 8 wk) with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), with a cutoff of \u2265 13.\n\nCRH concentration in the CSF was significantly higher in pregnant (4.1 \u00b1 0.51 log CRH) than in nonpregnant women (3.6 \u00b1 0.26 log CRH) (P < .001). Depressive symptoms starting after delivery occurred in 5.6% of women. CRH concentration in CSF was not different between women without depressive symptoms and women showing such symptoms during pregnancy or in the postpartum period.",
        "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with poor prognosis and a high health care burden. The incidence of asthma and COPD overlap syndrome is increasing, and contributes to a high financial burden and poor prognosis.\n\nTo investigate clinical features of the overlap syndrome among Asian patients and to analyse its impact on hospitalisation due to respiratory problems or death compared to COPD alone.\n\nWe performed a retrospective cohort analysis of 2933 COPD patients presenting at the Asan Medical Center from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2009. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard models were used to analyse the significance of clinical parameters, including age, sex, smoking history, body mass index (BMI), severity of airflow limitation, airway obstruction reversibility and overlap syndrome with hospitalisation due to respiratory problems or death.\n\nOverlap syndrome patients were older, included smaller proportions of males and of smokers and had lower forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) (% predicted). Shorter hospitalisation-free and survival periods were noted among overlap syndrome patients. Overlap syndrome was significantly associated with risk of hospitalisation due to respiratory problems after adjusting for age, smoking history, BMI, FEV1 (% predicted) and changes in FEV1 (P < 0.001).",
        "This cross-sectional study investigates the relationship between motor performance and mental health in a representative population of children with hearing impairment.\n\nNinety-three pupils (45 males, 48 females) aged 6 years to 16 years (mean 11 y 3 mo, SD 2 y 9 mo) with hearing impairment of at least 40 dB and a Nonverbal IQ greater than 70 were assessed for motor performance with the Z\u00fcrich Neuromotor Assessment (ZNA) and for mental health with the parent version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ).\n\nChildren with hearing impairment had lower motor performance scores in all four ZNA subscales compared with ZNA norms (z-scores -1.42 to -2.67). After controlling for Nonverbal IQ, ZNA pure motor performance correlated negatively with the SDQ total difficulties score. Pure motor, pegboard, and dynamic balance subscales correlated negatively with peer-relationship problems. Dynamic balance correlated negatively with emotional problems. Performance in pure motor and dynamic balance skills correlated negatively with age. Except for static balance, no correlation was found between motor performance and the degree of hearing impairment.",
        "We aimed to assess whether age at menarche was associated with insulin sensitivity in young adult women.\n\nWe studied 54 healthy young women aged 20-30 years. Participants were grouped according to age at menarche: Early (\u226411.0 years; n=13), Average (>12.0 and \u226413.0 years; n=28), and Late (\u226514.0 years, n=13). Primary outcome was insulin sensitivity measured using intravenous glucose tolerance tests and Bergman\"s minimal model. Body composition was assessed using whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.\n\nEarlier menarche was associated with lower insulin sensitivity (p=0.015). There was also a continuous increase in adiposity with younger age at menarche, which was associated with increased weight (p=0.001), BMI (p=0.002), total body fat (p=0.049), and truncal fat (p=0.020). Stratified analyses showed that insulin sensitivity in Early women (5.5 x10-4\u00b7min-1(mU/l)) was lower than in Average (8.0 x10-4\u00b7min-1(mU/l), p=0.021) and Late (8.6 x10-4\u00b7min-1(mU/l), p=0.033) groups.

        "The volume and complexity of endovascular procedures are increasing. Multidetector computed tomography (CT) made precise three-dimensional (3D) planning of these procedures possible, but intraoperative imaging, even with the use of modern flat-panel detectors, is limited to two dimensions. Flat detectors, however, allow C-arm cone-beam CT. This technology can be used to generate a 3D data set that can be fused with a preoperative high-resolution CT scan, thus generating a live 3D roadmap. We hypothesized that use of a novel image fusion software, VesselNavigator (Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands), facilitates precise and expeditious procedures and therefore reduces radiation exposure and contrast agent dose.\n\nA retrospective review of patients undergoing standard aortobi-iliac endovascular aneurysm repair at our institution between January 2011 and April 2014 was performed. Conventional imaging was compared with VesselNavigator-assisted imaging, and a matched analysis based on body mass index (BMI) was performed because of the dependence of radiation dose on body habitus. Outcome parameters were procedure time, fluoroscopy time, radiation, and contrast agent dose.\n\nA total of 75 patients were identified. After matching based on BMI, control and VesselNavigator groups each had 16 patients with BMI of 27.0 \u00b1 3.6 kg/m(2) and 27.0 \u00b1 3.6 kg/m(2), respectively (mean \u00b1 standard deviation). R(2) was 6.37 \u00d7 10(-7). Radiation dose measured as air kerma was lower with VesselNavigator (1067 \u00b1 470.4 mGy vs 1768 \u00b1 696.2 mGy; P = .004). Fluoroscopy time was shorter (18.4 \u00b1 6.8 minutes vs 26.8 \u00b1 10.0 minutes; P = .01) and contrast agent dose was lower (37.4 \u00b1 21.3 mL vs 77.3 \u00b1 23.0 mL; P < .001) with VesselNavigator compared with control.

        "The study of mammalian development has offered many insights into the molecular aetiology of cancer. We previously used analysis of mammary morphogenesis to discover a critical role for GATA-3 in mammary developmental and carcinogenesis. In recent years an important role for microRNAs (miRNAs) in a myriad of cellular processes in development and in oncogenesis has emerged.\n\nmicroRNA profiling was conducted on stromal and epithelial cellular subsets microdissected from the pubertal mouse mammary gland. miR-184 was reactivated by transient or stable overexpression in breast cancer cell lines and examined using a series of in vitro (proliferation, tumour-sphere and protein synthesis) assays. Orthotopic xenografts of breast cancer cells were used to assess the effect of miR-184 on tumourigenesis as well as distant metastasis. Interactions between miR-184 and its putative targets were assessed by quantitative PCR, microarray, bioinformatics and 3\" untranslated region Luciferase reporter assay. The methylation status of primary patient samples was determined by MBD-Cap sequencing. Lastly, the clinical prognostic significance of miR-184 putative targets was assessed using publicly available datasets.\n\nA large number of microRNA were restricted in their expression to specific tissue subsets. MicroRNA-184 (miR-184) was exclusively expressed in epithelial cells and markedly upregulated during differentiation of the proliferative, invasive cells of the pubertal terminal end bud (TEB) into ductal epithelial cells in vivo. miR-184 expression was silenced in mouse tumour models compared to non-transformed epithelium and in a majority of breast cancer cell line models. Ectopic reactivation of miR-184 inhibited the proliferation and self-renewal of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines in vitro and delayed primary tumour formation and reduced metastatic burden in vivo. Gene expression studies uncovered multi-factorial regulation of genes in the AKT/mTORC1 pathway by miR-184. In clinical breast cancer tissues, expression of miR-184 is lost in primary TNBCs while the miR-184 promoter is methylated in a subset of lymph node metastases from TNBC patients.",
        "Though necessary for improved outcomes, surgical resection is often limited in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancers (LAPCs). We evaluated the efficacy of the approach adopted by our institution of using modified FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy followed by radiation with concurrent gemcitabine or capecitabine for patients with LAPCs, in an effort to enhance resectability while improving the toxicity profile compared with similar treatment regimens.\n\nWe included 29 consecutive patients with LAPC treated at our institution with the above approach in this review. We evaluated rates of resection, locol control, and survival outcomes in this cohort.\n\nThe median follow up for this series of patients was 15.2 months. Approximately half the patients were unresectable at presentation. After neoadjuvant therapy, 41.3% of all patients were able to undergo resection of their tumors and 83% achieved an R0 resection. One-year local control for the entire cohort was 85%; one-year progression-free and overall were 49.2% and 65.5%, respectively. High rates of metastatic disease were seen regardless of resectability.

        "Achieving a major molecular response (MMR) is the goal of imatinib therapy for chronic myeloid leukemia. However, the association between gender, BCR-ABL transcript type, and age with MMR is not well understood and often controversial.\n\nWe retrospectively analyzed 166 patients who have been treated with imatinib for up to 10 yr.\n\nMen had a lower MMR rate than women (63.3% vs. 81.6%, P = 0.006) and a shorter time to relapse (median 354 vs. 675 d, P = 0.049), while patients with b3a2 or with both b3a2 and b2a2 break point transcripts had higher MMR rate than those with b2a2 (81.8%, 77.1% vs. 60.7%, P = 0.023 for b3a2 vs. b2a2, P = 0.043 for both vs. b2a2). A striking difference was found between men with b2a2 and women with both b2a2 and b3a2 in terms of MMR rate (43.8% vs. 88.9%), MMR rate within 6 months (7.1% vs. 62.5%) and the time to MMR (median d 493 vs. 159, P = 0.036).",
        "Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which involves changes in cellular morphology of highly polarized epithelial cells and the gain of mesenchymal cell phenotype with migratory and invasive capacities, is implicated in smoking-related chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, the interactions of fibroblasts and epithelial cells and the participation of fibroblasts in the EMT processes in COPD are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that EMT is active in human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells of COPD patients, and that mediators secreted by lung fibroblasts from COPD patients induce EMT.\n\nPrimary HBE cells from normal subjects and COPD patients were purchased from LONZA. HLFs were derived from resected lung obtained from normal (N) and COPD (D) subjects and their conditioned medium (CM) was collected after 2-day culture in serum-free medium. The expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers as well as EMT-related transcription factors in lung biopsies, and in HBE cells following stimulation with CM from both normal human lung fibroblasts (NHLF) and COPD human lung fibroblasts (DHLF) was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR and western blot.\n\nBasal mRNA expression of mesenchymal markers and EMT-related transcription factors were increased in DHBE cells compared to normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) cells as well as in COPD lungs. CM from NHLF significantly induced vimentin expression in both NHBE and COPD human bronchial epithelial cells (DHBE) cells, but only increased N-cadherin expression in DHBE cells. CM from NHLF significantly induced Twist1 and Twist2 expression in NHBE cells and increased Snai2 (Slug) expression in DHBE cells. While CM from NHLF had no effect on such EMT markers, CM from DHLF significantly increased the protein expression of E-cadherin and vimentin in NHBE cells compared to control. N-cadherin expression was upregulated to a greater degree in NHBE cells than DHBE cells. Only CM from DHLF significantly increased E-/N-cadherin ratio in DHBE cells.",
        "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is associated with memory and learning deficits. Evidence has been provided that vitamin D is involved in brain function. The aim of the present study was to determine the potential effect of vitamin D on acquisition and retention of memory and learning in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice.\n\nExperiments were performed in four groups of mice (each group; n = 7). Male mice were induced to diabetes by single dose (60 mg/kg, i.p.) injection of freshly prepared STZ dissolved in cold normal saline. Treatment with vitamin D (5\u00b5g/kg daily, i.p. dissolved in tween80) was begun at three days after diabetes induction. Passive avoidance (PA) learning method was used four weeks later. Retrieval test was carried out 24 h after training.\n\nOur results demonstrate significant impairment in acquisition and retrieval processes of PA learning in STZ- induced diabetic mice. Treatment with vitamin D improved learning and memory compared to the control group, both in acquisition and retrieval stages and reversed learning deficits in diabetic mice. In acquisition test, there were significant differences in the initial latency among the DM+Vit. D treated and control groups (P < 0.05). There was a significant difference in step-through latency between diabetic group treated with vitamin D compared to diabetic non-treated groups (P < 0.05).",
        "Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is expressed in the kidney and may be a renoprotective enzyme since it converts angiotensin (Ang) II to Ang-(1-7). In addition, ACE2 has been detected in urine from patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The aim of this study was to determine the urinary ACE2 levels in patients with various stages of CKD and to identify the factors associated with the presence of ACE2.\n\nWe assessed 152 patients with CKD stage G1-G4. The patients were classified according to the presence or absence of diabetes mellitus (DM) (DM group, n = 72; non-DM group, n = 80) and according to the estimated glomerular filtration rate (CKD stage G1/2 group, n = 40; CKD stage G3 group, n = 74; and CKD stage G4 group, n = 38). Parameters were urinary ACE2, urinary albumin/ creatinine ratio (UACR), urinary liver-type fatty acid binding protein (L-FABP), estimated glomerular filtration rate, and other factors determined to be associated with elevated urinary ACE2.\n\nUrinary ACE2 was significantly higher in patients with diabetes (p = 0.01) and in patients with CKD stage G4 compared with stages G1-G3 (p < 0.0001). Multivariable regression analysis revealed that urinary L-FABP and UACR were significantly associated with urinary ACE2 levels, indicating that urinary ACE2 is increased in patients with diabetes and advanced stage CKD.",

The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the EC-V3 pattern for diagnosing invasive cancer were 74.6%, 97.2%, and 88.6%, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of the EC-V pattern for predicting hyperplastic polyps was comparable to the other modalities. For predicting invasive cancer, the EC-V pattern was comparable to narrow-band imaging and pit pattern, although EC-C was slightly more accurate (P\\xa0= .04). In the substudy, the diagnosis time by using the EC-V pattern was shorter than that with the EC-C pattern (P\\xa0< .001).",
        "The identification of species B and E in the Anopheles culicifacies complex in the Indian subcontinent has been based on Y-chromosome karyotype. Since no detectable variations were previously found in DNA markers commonly used for sibling species identification, further molecular characterization using cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and microsatellite markers was carried out on Y-chromosome karyotyped Anopheles culicifacies specie B and E from Unnichchai, Kallady and Ranawarunawa in Sri Lanka.\n\nCOI sequence analysis (n\\u2009=\\u200922) revealed the presence of nine unique haplotypes with six in each species.

SIRT1 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression were determined with Western blot. The transcriptional activity of NF-\u03baB was evaluated by luciferase reporter assay. The expression of Sirt1 was silenced by RNA interference. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and potassium-stimulated insulin secretion (KSIS) assays were performed to measure the effect of ART on pancreatic beta-cells\" function. The effect of ART on beta-cells apoptosis was evaluated by using Hochest/PI staining and TUNEL assay.\n\nART enhanced GSIS (KSIS) and reduced apoptosis of pancreatic beta-cells induced by IL-1\u03b2. Further study showed that ART inhibited IL-1\u03b2-induced increase of NF-\u03baB activity, iNOS expression, and NO production. Moreover, ART up-regulated SIRT1 expression in INS-1 cells and islets exposed to IL-1\u03b2. Inhibition of SIRT1 expression could partially abolished the inhibitory effect of ART on NF-\u03baB activity in IL-1\u03b2-treated beta-cells.

The recombinant plasmids pEGFP-N1-AQP9 and pshRNA-AQP9 were transfected into HepG2 cells. The expression of AQP9 mRNA and protein were detected by reverse transcription PCR and Western blotting, respectively. Then As2O3 was added to plasmid-transfected cells and untreated HepG2 cells. Cell proliferation was detected by MTT assay, cell cycle and apoptosis rate were determined by flow cytometry, and cell invasion and migration ability were examined by Transwell(TM) (Boyden Chamber) assay. The activity of caspase-3 was detected by microplate reader.\n\nThe recombinant plasmids remarkably influenced the expression of AQP9. Compared with the group treated with As2O3 alone (control group), the cell proliferation, invasion and migration of HepG2 cells transfected with pEGFP-N1-AQP9 were attenuated significantly, while the cells transfected with pshRNA-AQP9 increased. The increasing population of apoptotic cells, augmented caspase 3 activity and highest percentage of cells stagnating at G0/G1 phase were observed in HepG2 cells transfected with pEGFP-N1-AQP9 as compared with the control HepG2 cells; in contrast, the HepG2 cells transfected with pshRNA-AQP9 presented with lower caspase 3 activity and stronger invasion and migration ability than the control HepG2 cells did.",

Then, vector pEGFP-N1-NANOGP8 and recombinant plasmid shRNA-NANOGP8 were transfected into SGC-7901 cells via liposome. The expression of NANOGP8 mRNA and protein were tested by fluorescence microscopy, reverse transcription PCR and Western blotting, respectively. The proliferation of SGC-7901 cells was detected by CCK-8 assay. The apoptosis and cell cycle were examined by flow cytometry. TranswellTM assay proved the changes in the invasion and migration abilities of SGC-7901 cells.\n\nThe recombinant plasmids pEGEP-N1-NANOGP8 and pshRNA-NANOGP8 were constructed successfully and transfected into gastric cancer cells. pEGEP-N1-NANOGP8 transfection group showed high expression of NANOGP8, conversely, pshRNA-NANOGP8 transfection group showed low expression of NANOGP8. High expression of NANOGP8 significantly promoted the proliferation of tumor cells, arrested cells cycle in the S phase, decreased apoptotic cells and increased cell invasion and migration obviously.

ELISA was used to detect the levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) in culture fluid. In addition, the expression of nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) was determined by Western blotting. The underlying mechanism involved in chemerin-induced insulin resistance was evaluated with the precondition of NF-\u03baB blocker pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC).\n\nChemerin inhibited the glucose uptake of C2C12 cells in a dose-dependent manner, concomitant with the increases of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1 levels. Furthermore, chemerin stimulation improved the expression of NF-\u03baB.

        "A retrospective imaging and clinical study.\n\nTo evaluate the relationship between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features and neurological prognosis in patients with traumatic cervical spinal cord injury (CSCI) without major bone injury.\n\nA total of 72 patients with CSCI without major bone injury were treated conservatively in our hospital. MRI was performed for all patients at admission and 1 month following injury. We measured the antero-posterior and cranio-caudal diameter of intramedullary intensity changed area with T1-weighted images at the injured segment. Neurological evaluations were performed using the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) motor score and the modified Frankel grade at the time of admission and discharge.\n\nThere was a significant relationship between the antero-posterior diameter ratio of the T1-weighted low-intensity area on MRI at the subacute stage and the ASIA motor score. The optimal threshold of the T1-weighted low-intensity diameter ratio for predicting the patient\"s ability to walk with or without assistance at discharge was determined to be 46%. Moreover, 96.8% of the patients with <50% T1-weighted low-intensity area recovered to walk with or without a cane at discharge.",
        "Electric stimulation has been proved to be available to monitor the efficacy of renal denervation (RDN). This study was to evaluate the effectiveness of high-frequency stimulation (HFS)-guided proximal RDN.\n\nA total of 13 Chinese Kunming dogs were included and allocated to proximal RDN group (n=8) and control group (n=5). HFS (20 Hz, 8 V, pulse width 2 ms) was performed from proximal to distal renal artery in all dogs. Radiofrequency ablations were delivered in proximal RDN group and only at the proximal positive sites where systolic blood pressure (BP) increased \u226510 mm\\u2009Hg during HFS. Postablation HFS was performed over the previously stimulated sites. BP, heart rate, and plasma norepinephrine were analyzed. In 8 denervated dogs, preablation HFS caused significant BP increases of 6.0\u00b15.0/3.4\u00b15.5, 16.9\u00b111.7/11.1\u00b18.5, and 17.1\u00b18.4/8.5\u00b15.3 mm\\u2009Hg during the first, second, and third 20 s of HFS at the proximal positive sites. After ablation, these sites showed a negative response to postablation HFS with increases of BP by 1.3\u00b13.0/1.0\u00b12.5, 0.8\u00b13.9/1.5\u00b13.4, and 1.5\u00b14.5/0.7\u00b13.8 mm\\u2009Hg. Of note, no radiofrequency applications were delivered at the positive sites of middle renal artery, repeated HFS increased BP only by 3.3\u00b15.3/2.8\u00b14.2, 5.3\u00b16.6/3.8\u00b14.7, and 2.9\u00b14.6/1.3\u00b13.2 mm\\u2009Hg, failed to reproduce the previous BP increases of 6.2\u00b15.6/5.3\u00b14.4, 15.0\u00b19.3/10.2\u00b16.2, and 14.9\u00b17.7/8.4\u00b14.7 mm\\u2009Hg. At 3 months, BP and plasma norepinephrine substantially decreased in proximal RDN group. Whereas controls showed minimal BP decreases and had similar plasma norepinephrine concentrations as baseline.",
        "Analysis of a microRNA (miRNA) expression signature of bladder cancer (BC) by deep-sequencing revealed that clustered miRNAs microRNA (miR)-451a, miR-144-3p, and miR-144-5p were significantly downregulated in BC tissues. We hypothesised that these miRNAs function as tumour suppressors in BC. The aim of this study was to investigate the functional roles of these miRNAs and their modulation of cancer networks in BC cells.\n\nThe functional studies of BC cells were performed using transfection of mature miRNAs. Genome-wide gene expression analysis, in silico analysis, and dual-luciferase reporter assays were applied to identify miRNA targets. The association between miR-144-5p levels and expression of the target genes was determined, and overall patient survival as a function of target gene expression was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method.\n\nGain-of-function studies showed that miR-144-5p significantly inhibited cell proliferation by BC cells. Four cell cycle-related genes (CCNE1, CCNE2, CDC25A, and PKMYT1) were identified as direct targets of miR-144-5p. The patients with high CCNE1 or CCNE2 expression had lower overall survival probabilities than those with low expression (P=0.025 and P=0.032).",
        "Functional microRNAs (miRNAs) in exosomes have been recognised as potential stable biomarkers in cancers. The aim of this study is to identify specific miRNAs in exosome as serum biomarkers for the early detection of recurrence in human colorectal cancer (CRC).\n\nSerum samples were sequentially obtained from six patients with and without recurrent CRC. The miRNAs were purified from exosomes, and miRNA microarray analysis was performed. The miRNA expression profiles and copy number aberrations were explored using microarray and array CGH analyses in 124 CRC tissues. Then, we validated exosomal miRNAs in 2 serum sample sets (90 and 209 CRC patients) by quantitative real-time RT-PCR.\n\nExosomal miR-17-92a cluster expression level in serum was correlated with the recurrence of CRC. Exosomal miR-19a expression levels in serum were significantly increased in patients with CRC as compared with healthy individuals with gene amplification. The CRC patients with high exosomal miR-19a expression showed poorer prognoses than the low expression group (P<0.001).",
        "Oxidative stress has been implicated in the progression of pathogenesis in diabetes mellitus and leads to a variety of deformations in the central nervous system. Recent studies have provided several insights on therapeutic uses of resveratrol in diabetic complications.\n\nThe present study determines if resveratrol ameliorates oxidative stress and molecular changes in the brain frontal cortex of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.\n\nRats were divided into four groups: control, diabetic, resveratrol-treated control, and resveratrol-treated diabetic. After diabetes induction, resveratrol (20\\u2009mg/kg) was given intraperitoneally once daily for 4 weeks. In addition to enzymatic activities, gene and protein expression of brain antioxidant enzymes were utilized by qRT-PCR and Western blot, respectively.\n\nThe results indicated a significant elevation in total oxidant species (1.22-fold) and malonedialdehyde (1.38-fold) contents in diabetic rat brain cortex tissues. In addition, significant augmentation in the activities of catalase (1.38-fold) and superoxide dismutase (3-fold) was witnessed with the gene and protein expression levels reflecting a transcriptional regulation. Resveratrol treatment significantly normalized diabetic malonedialdehyde and oxidized glutathione levels and strengthens the action of all antioxidant enzymes. Recovery of the diabetes-associated changes reflects the reduction of oxidative conditions by resveratrol and reveals the decrease in the requirement for the activation of antioxidant defense systems in the brain tissues of diabetic rats.",
        "Regular physical activity is recommended to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in a healthy population. Inhibition of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) was shown to reduce (LDL-C) levels; however, the impact of physical exercise on PCSK9 levels remains unclear.\n\nWe used data from 67 healthy hospital employees who participated in a 6-month intervention promoting active use of stairs instead of elevators during 3 months, followed by 3 months without recommendation. We confirmed the degree of physical activity with estimated aerobic capacity (VO2 max ) and measured serum PCSK9 levels at baseline, 3 and 6 month. Using a multilevel regression model, we analysed changes of PCSK9 levels over time adjusting for age, gender, aerobic capacity, baseline LDL-C, and LDL-C and body mass index (BMI) changes.\n\nAt baseline, PCSK9 levels were associated with higher aerobic capacity (P-value = 0\u00b7024). At 3 months, we observed a significant decrease in mean PCSK9 levels from 403\u00b76 to 324\u00b73 ng/mL (P-value = 0\u00b7001), as well a significant decrease in mean LDL-C levels from 3\u00b75 to 3\u00b73 mM (P-value = 0\u00b701). During this period, mean aerobic capacity (VO2 max ) increased from 37\u00b70 to 40\u00b74 mL/kg/min (P-value < 0\u00b7001). Physical activity was independently associated with a decrease in PCSK9 levels after adjustment for age, gender, baseline aerobic capacity, and LDL-C and BMI changes.",
        "ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type-1 motif) zinc metalloproteinases are important during the synthesis and breakdown of cartilage extracellular matrix. ADAMTS-12 is up-regulated during in vitro chondrogenesis and embryonic limb development; however, the regulation of ADAMTS-12 expression in cartilage remains unknown. The transcription factor c-Maf is a member of Maf family of basic ZIP (bZIP) transcription factors. Expression of c-Maf is highest in hypertrophic chondrocytes during embryonic development and postnatal growth. We hypothesize that c-Maf and ADAMTS-12 are co-expressed during chondrocyte differentiation and that c-Maf regulates ADAMTS-12 expression during chondrogenesis.\n\nPromoter analysis and species alignments identified potential c-Maf binding sites in the ADAMTS-12 promoter. c-Maf and ADAMTS-12 co-expression was monitored during chondrogenesis of stem cell pellet cultures. Luciferase expression driven by ADAMTS-12 promoter segments was measured in the presence and absence of c-Maf, and synthetic oligonucleotides were used to confirm specific binding of c-Maf to ADAMTS-12 promoter sequences.\n\nIn vitro chondrogenesis from human mesenchymal stem cells revealed co-expression of ADAMTS-12 and c-Maf during differentiation. Truncation and point mutations of the ADAMTS-12 promoter evaluated in reporter assays localized the response to the proximal 315 bp of the ADAMTS-12 promoter, which contained a predicted c-Maf recognition element (MARE) at position -61. Electorphoretic mobility shift assay confirmed that c-Maf directly interacted with the MARE at position -61.",
        "Retrospective cross-sectional database analysis.\n\nThe cost of spine surgery is growing exponentially, and cost-effectiveness is a critical consideration. Smoking has been shown to increase hospital costs in general surgery, but this impact has not been reported in patients with spinal disease. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of smoking on cost and complications in a large sample of patients admitted for treatment of spinal disease.\n\nIn 2012, the authors identified all inpatient admissions to all University HealthSystem Consortium (UHC) hospitals from 2005 to 2011 for spinal disease based on the principal diagnosis ICD-9-CM codes from the prospectively collected UHC database. Patient outcomes - including length of stay; complication, readmission, intensive care unit admission rates; and total cost - were compared for non-obese smokers and non-smokers using a two-sample t-test.\n\nThere were 137,537 patients, including 136,511 (122,608 non-smokers and 13,903 smokers) in the 4 largest diagnostic groups. Smoking was associated with increased complications and worse outcomes in three of these four groups. All outcomes in the two largest groups - fracture and dorsopathy - were worse in the smoking patients.",
        "To investigate the acute effects of the ingestion of a fructose-containing beverage combinedwith fat on postprandial lipoprotein metabolism.\n\nTwelve young healthy Japanese women with apolipoprotein E phenotype 3/3 were enrolled in this study. At each of four sessions, the subjects ingested one of four sugar beverages containing fructose and/or glucose (total: 0.5g/kg body weight) combined with OFTT cream (1g/kg, 0.35g/kg as fat) in a randomized crossover design. The four sugar beverages were as follows: 100% (w/w) fructose (F100), 90% fructose+10% glucose (F90G10), 55% fructose+45% glucose (F55G45) and 100% glucose (G100). Venous blood samples were obtained at baseline and 0.5, one, two, four and six hours after ingestion.\n\nThe serum concentrations of TG in the F100, F90G10 and F55G45 trials were significantlyhigher than each fasting value at two and four hours, and returned to baseline at six hours, except inthe F100 trial. The concentrations at four hours and the incremental areas under the curve for thehepatic triglyceride-rich lipoprotein-triglyceride (VLDL-TG(TM)) levels in the F100 and F90G10 trialswere significantly higher and larger, respectively, than those observed in the G100 trial. Meanwhile,the concentrations of RLP-TG and apolipoprotein B-48 peaked at two hours in the G100 trial, versusfour hours in the other trials, and did not return to baseline at six hours, except in the G100 trial.At four hours, the \u22bfapoB48 tended to be higher in the F100 trial than in the G100 trial.",

        "To evaluate the clinical efficacy of autologous semitendinosus and gracilis tendon grafting with anchor repair for the treatment of chronic achilles tendon rupture and severe scarring.\n\nFrom April 2010 to October 2012,26 patients with chronic achilles tendon rupture(with Myerson type III ) and severe scarring were treated with autologous semitendinosus and gracilis tendon grafting with anchor repair. There were 19 males and 7 females,with an average age of 32 years old (ranged, 22 to 47 years). The time from injury to surgery was from 3 to 12 months (7 months on average). The plantar flexion strength of all injuried feet attenuated and single heel rise test were positive in 26 cases before operation. Plaster immobilization and routine rehabilitation therapy were performed after operation. Clinical effects were evaluated by Arner-lindholm criterion and complications were observed after operation.\n\nAll the patients were followed up from 12 to 24 months with a mean of 16 months.

        "This study aimed to investigate the relationship between miR-506 and proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells.\n\nMiR-506 mimics, inhibitor, and negative control (NC) were transfected into MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Cell proliferation, cell counting, colony formation assay, and Transwell assay were applied to evaluate the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells. Data are shown as mean \u00b1 standard deviation and the experiment was performed 3 times. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS version 10.0.\n\nAt 1 day after transfection, cell proliferation detected by CCK-8 assay was significantly promoted in miR-506 inhibitor when compared with the miR-506 mimics group and the NC group (P<0.05). At 3 days or 5 days after transfection, cell proliferation was markedly inhibited in the miR-506 mimics group, and miR-506 inhibitor was still significantly promoted. Cell counting with a hemocytometer showed similar results to cell proliferation. Colony formation assay showed that the number of colonies in the miR-506 mimics group was significantly smaller than that in the miR-506 inhibitor group and NC group. Transwell assay revealed that the number of migrated cells in miR-506 mimics was markedly smaller than that in the miR-506 inhibitor group and NC group.",
        "IL-1\u03b2 has been shown to play a pivotal role in autoimmunity. Cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteinase-1 (caspase-1) inhibitor may be an important drug target for autoimmune diseases. However, the effects of caspase-1 inhibitor on myasthenia gravis (MG) remain undefined.\n\nTo investigate the effects of caspase-1 inhibitor on experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG), an animal model of MG, caspase-1 inhibitor was administered to Lewis rats immunized with region 97-116 of the rat AChR \u03b1 subunit (R97-116 peptide) in complete Freund\"s adjuvant. The immunophenotypical characterization by flow cytometry and the levels of autoantibody by ELISA were carried out to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of caspase-1 inhibitor.\n\nWe found that caspase-1 inhibitor improved EAMG clinical symptom, which was associated with decreased IL-17 production by CD4+ T cells and \u03b3\u03b4 T cells, lower affinity of anti-R97-116 peptide IgG. Caspase-1 inhibitor decreased expression of CD80, CD86, and MHC class II on DCs, as well as intracellular IL-1\u03b2 production from DCs. In addition, caspase-1 inhibitor treatment inhibited R97-116 peptide-specific cell proliferation and decreased follicular helper T cells relating to EAMG development.",

The ABI was performed before surgery. Patients with abnormal ABI (\u2264 0.9) were included in the peripheral artery disease (PAD) group and the remaining constituted the control group. Cardiac troponin and electrocardiogram were obtained 72 hours after surgery. Patients were followed up to 30 days, and primary end point was the occurrence of any cardiovascular event: cardiovascular death, acute coronary syndrome, isolated troponin elevation (ITE), decompensated heart failure, cardiogenic shock, unstable arrhythmias, nonfatal cardiac arrest, pulmonary edema, stroke, or PAD symptoms increase.\n\nWe evaluated 124 patients (61.3% male; mean age 65.4 years). During the study, 57.9% of patients in the PAD group had an event versus 25.7% in the control group (P = .011). The ITE was the most observed event (24.2%). After logistic regression, the odds ratio for ITE was 7.4 (95% confidence interval 2.2-25.0, P = .001).",
        "Banana and plantain (Musa spp.) comprise an important part of diets for millions of people around the globe. Low temperature is one of the key environmental stresses which greatly affects the global banana production. To understand the molecular mechanism of the cold-tolerance in plantain we used RNA-Seq based comparative transcriptomics analyses for both cold-sensitive banana and cold-tolerant plantain subjected to the cold stress for 0, 3 and 6 h.\n\nThe cold-response genes at early stage are identified and grouped in both species by GO analysis. The results show that 10 and 68 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are identified for 3 and 6 h of cold stress respectively in plantain, while 40 and 238 DEGs are identified respectively in banana. GO classification analyses show that the majority of DEGs identified in both banana and plantain belong to 11 categories including regulation of transcription, response to stress signal transduction, etc. A similar profile for 28 DEGs was found in both banana and plantain for 6 h of cold stress, suggesting both share some common adaptation processes in response to cold stress. There are 17 DEGs found uniquely in cold-tolerance plantain, which were involved in signal transduction, abiotic stress, copper ion equilibrium, photosynthesis and photorespiration, sugar stimulation, protein modifications etc. Twelve early responsive genes including ICE1 and MYBS3 were selected and further assessed and confirmed by qPCR in the extended time course experiments (0, 3, 6, 24 and 48 h), which revealed significant expression difference of key genes in response to cold stress, especially ICE1 and MYBS3 between cold-sensitive banana and cold-tolerant plantain.",

Patients with T2DM were required to have diabetes mellitus (DM) for at least 5 years and be receiving oral hypoglycemic treatment or insulin.\n\nParticipants were categorized according to their worst-ever DR grading, as having \"no DR\" (no history of nonproliferative DR [NPDR], proliferative DR [PDR], or diabetic macular edema [DME]) or \"any DR\" (further subclassified as NPDR or PDR, without or with DME). Clinical characteristics, glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c]), and presence of diabetic complications were determined at recruitment. Genotyping was performed for 13 VEGFC tag SNPs.\n\nOdds ratios (ORs) were determined for associations with DR of VEGFC tag SNPs, individually and within haplotypes. Logistic regression was used to adjust for clinical covariates, including DM type, age, sex, DM duration, hypertension, nephropathy, HbA1c, and smoking.\n\nParticipants with DM but \"no DR\" (n\\xa0= 980) were compared with 1919 participants with DM and \"any DR.\" Three VEGFC SNPs were associated with DR after logistic regression: rs17697419 (P\\xa0= 0.001; OR,\\xa00.67; confidence interval [CI], 0.52-0.85), rs17697515 (P\\xa0= 0.001; OR, 0.62; CI, 0.47-0.81), and rs2333526 (P\\xa0= 0.005; OR, 0.69; CI, 0.54-0.90). rs17697515 Was also specifically associated with DME in those with T2DM (P\\xa0= 0.004; OR, 0.53; CI, 0.35-0.82).

        "Machado-Joseph Disease (MJD), a form of dominantly inherited ataxia belonging to the group of polyQ expansion neurodegenerative disorders, occurs when a threshold value for the number of glutamines in Ataxin-3 (Atx3) polyglutamine region is exceeded. As a result of its modular multidomain architecture, Atx3 is known to engage in multiple macromolecular interactions, which might be unbalanced when the polyQ tract is expanded, culminating in the aggregation and formation of intracellular inclusions, a unifying fingerprint of this group of neurodegenerative disorders. Since aggregation is specific to certain brain regions, localization-dependent posttranslational modifications that differentially affect Atx3 might also contribute for MJD.\n\nWe combined in vitro and cellular approaches to address SUMOylation in the brain-predominant Atx3 isoform and assessed the impact of this posttranslational modification on Atx3 self-assembly and interaction with its native partner, p97.\n\nWe demonstrate that Atx3 is SUMOylated at K356 both in vitro and in cells, which contributes for decreased formation of amyloid fibrils and for increased affinity towards p97.",
        "The present study was undertaken to evaluate the protective effects of the fruit extract of Tribulus terrestris (TT) on the metronidazole (MTZ)-induced alterations in spermatogenesis, sperm count, testicular functions, and oxidative stress.\n\nThirty adult Swiss strain mice were divided into six groups. Animals of Groups I and II served as untreated and vehicle-treated controls, while that of Groups III and IV were administered with MTZ (500 mg/kg BW/day) and TT (200 mg/kg BW/day) alone for 28 days, respectively. Low (100 mg/kg BW/day) and high (200 mg/kg BW/day) doses of TT along with MTZ (500 mg/kg BW/day) were administered for 28 days in the mice of Groups V and VI, respectively. Twenty four hours after the last treatment, all the animals were euthanized to study the histological changes in the testis and sperm count in the epididymis. Testicular functional markers, lipid peroxidation (LPO) and the activities of antioxidant enzymes, e.g., superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione reductase, were also assessed in the mice of all the groups.\n\nMetronidazole caused marked alterations in the testicular weight, spermatogenesis, activities of antioxidant enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, and the level of LPO. The epididymal sperm count also declined significantly in MTZ-treated group. These changes were partially restored following co-administration of 500 mg/kg BW/day of MTZ and 100 mg/kg BW/day of TT. However, in the mice co-administered with 500 mg/kg BW/day of MTZ and 200 mg/kg BW/day of TT, the changes reverted back completely, similar to that of the controls.",
        "Lead (Pb) is a long-known poison of environment and industrial origin. Its prolonged exposure affects cellular material and alters cellular genetics and produces oxidative damages. In this study, we investigated the exposure of chronic sustained hypoxia or lead acetate alone or in combination with or without supplementation of \u03b1-tocopherol on hepatic oxidative and nitrosative stress in rats.\n\nThe rats weighing 165 \u00b1 5 g were exposed to chronic sustained hypoxia (10% oxygen) or lead acetate (25 mg/kg of body weight, intraperitoneally) alone or in combination with or without supplementation of \u03b1-tocopherol (10 mg/100 g b.wt, intramuscularly). The body weight of all the rats was recorded on the day 1 of the treatment and the day of sacrifice. Serum lipid profile was estimated by using a biochemical analyzer. Oxidant and enzymatic antioxidants status was evaluated by using spectrophotometer. Serum levels of hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1\u03b1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were measured by using ELISA technique. Histopathological assessments of hepatic tissue were also done.\n\nExposure of both lead and hypoxia showed decreased body weight, altered serum lipid profile, oxidant and enzymatic antioxidants status, serum HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF concentrations. Simultaneous \u03b1-tocopherol supplementation showed beneficial effects to all these alterations. Histopathological observations also showed hepatic degenerative changes after lead or hypoxia exposure either alone or in combination, but remarkable improvement has been noticed after \u03b1-tocopherol supplementation.",
        "Inflammation is a key factor in the development of plaque rupture and acute cardiovascular events. Although imaging techniques can be used to identify vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques, we are lacking non-invasive methods, such as plasma markers of plaque inflammation that could help to identify presence of vulnerable plaques. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether increased plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines reflects inflammatory activity within atherosclerotic plaques.\n\nCytokines were measured using Luminex immunoassay in 200 homogenized plaque extracts and plasma, obtained from 197 subjects undergoing carotid surgery. Plasma levels of macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u03b2 (MIP-1\u03b2), tumor necrosis factor- \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and fractalkine correlated significantly, not only with plaque levels of the same cytokines but also with the abundance of several pro-inflammatory and atherogenic cytokines assessed in plaque tissue. High plasma levels (upper tertile) of MIP-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 and fractalkine identified the presence of a plaque with high inflammation (above median of a score based on the plaque content of MIP-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) and fractalkine) with a sensitivity between 65 and 67% and a specificity between 78 and 83%. Furthermore, this study shows that high plasma levels of MIP-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1 and fractalkine predict future transient ischemic attacks.",
        "Thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for acute complicated type B aortic dissection (AD) promotes early positive aortic remodeling. However, little is known about the long-term effect of TEVAR on the dissected aorta, which is the goal of this study.\n\nBetween August 2005 and August 2009, 31 patients with complicated type B AD were treated with TEVAR and had >1-year follow-up imaging. Computed tomography angiograms obtained at 1 month, 1 year, and long term (average, 42 months) were compared with baseline scans. The largest diameters of the stented thoracic aorta, stented true lumen, and stented false lumen were recorded at each time point, as were the values in the unstented distal thoracic aorta and the abdominal aorta. Changes over time were evaluated by a mixed effect analysis of variance model of repeated measures.\n\nThe average age of the cohort was 56 years, and 74% were male. Indications for TEVAR were as follows: 61% malperfusion, 32% refractory hypertension, 45% impending rupture, and 32% persistent pain; 58% had more than one indication. All patients were treated in the acute phase within 7 days of the initial presentation. The average length of aorta covered was 19 cm. Observation of the stented segment over time showed that the maximum diameter of the stented thoracic aorta was stable (P = NS), the diameter of the stented true lumen increased (P < .001), and the diameter of the stented false lumen decreased (P < .001); 84% had complete false lumen obliteration across the stented aortic segment. Observation of the uncovered thoracic aorta over time showed that the maximum diameter increased (P = .014), as did the visceral segment of the aorta (P < .001). The average growth of the visceral segment was 31% in patients with a patent false lumen vs 3% in those with a thrombosed false lumen (P = .004). One patient had aneurysmal degeneration of the false lumen and required an additional endograft at 18 months.",

Among the 219 physician participants, there were 63 interns, 60 second-year residents, 26 chief residents and 70 attending physicians. The survey asked questions regarding respondents\" demographics, general hepatitis B virus knowledge questions (i.e., transmission, prevalence, diagnostic testing, prevention, and treatment options), as well as, self-reported practice behavior and confidence in knowledge.\n\nKnowledge about screening and managing patients with CHB was poor: only 24% identified the correct tests to screen for CHB, 13% knew the next steps for patients testing positive for CHB, 18% knew the high prevalence rate among API, and 31% knew how to screen for liver cancer. Wald chi-square analysis determined the effect of training level on knowledge; in all cases except for knowledge of liver cancer screening (P = 0.0032), knowledge did not significantly increase with length in residency training or completion of residency.",
        "To study the potential prognostic role of microRNA-382 (miR-382) in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).\n\nForty six patients were divided into 2 groups according to postoperative survival time: the poor outcome group (28 patients), who showed early metastasis but no recurrence, and died within 1 year after surgery, 12 patients of the group received postoperative chemotherapy treatment that was given after early metastasis happening; the good outcome group (18 patients), who had no clinical metastasis and recurrence, and survived 5 years or more after surgery, all patients did not receive any postoperative treatment. Total RNA was extracted from the patients\" formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded esophageal cancer tissues. miR-382 level was evaluated using high-throughput real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. The correlation between miR-382 level and clinicopathologic features was analyzed through COX regression model, and Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to analyze the relationship between miR-382 level and patient survival time.\n\nmiR-382 was differentially expressed in the two groups. Overall the average miR-382 level in the ESCC patients with good outcome was 9.8 \u00b1 3.8, while miR-382 level in the ESCC patients with poor outcome was 3.0 \u00b1 0.8. The differences of miR-382 levels between two groups were significant (P < 0.05). Kaplan-Meier analysis results showed that miR-382 expression level generally had a significant reverse-correlation with ESCC patient survival time (P < 0.001), in which the patients with higher expressions of miR-382 had a longer survival time either among individuals with the same tumor stage or among the overall patients.",
        "There is a growing awareness of the importance of carotid plaque features evaluation in stroke prediction. Carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and recently its echogenicity were used for stroke prediction, although their clinical relevance was not well determined. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between common carotid artery (CCA) ultrasound markers of atherosclerosis and distal, bifurcation and internal carotid artery (ICA), plaque features.\n\nWe analyzed 137 carotid arteries in 87 asymptomatic patients with known carotid disease (mean age 69 \u00b1 6 year, 34.5% females). Intima media thickness (IMT) and its gray scale median (IM-GSM) were measured at the CCA. Plaque textural features including gray scale median (GSM), juxtaluminal black area (JBA-mm(2)) without a visible cap, and plaque coarseness, at bifurcation and ICA were also determined. CCA measurements were correlated with those of the distal plaques.\n\nAn increased IMT in CCA correlated with plaque irregularities in the bifurcation and ICA (r=0.53, p<0.001), while IM-GSM was closely related to plaque echogenicity (GSM) (r=0.76, p<0.001), and other textural plaque features. Both, IMT and IM-GSM correlated weakly with stenosis severity (r=0.27, p=0.001 and r=-0.18, p=0.026) respectively.",
        "Recent studies reported that Naja naja atra venom (NNAV) regulated immune function and had a therapeutic effect on adjunctive arthritis and nephropathy. We hypothesized that NNAV and its active component, neurotoxin (NTX), might inhibit skin allograft rejection.\n\nSkin allografts were used to induce immune rejection in rats. In addition, mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) was used to mimic immune rejection reaction in vitro. Both NNAV and NTX were orally given starting from 5days prior to skin allograft surgery.\n\nThe results showed that oral administration of NNAV or NTX prolonged the survival of skin allografts and inhibited inflammatory response. The production of Th1 cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, IL-2) was also suppressed. NTX inhibited T-cell proliferation and CD4(+) T cell division induced by skin allografts. NTX also showed immunosuppressive activity in mixed lymphocyte culture. Atropine alone inhibited Con A-induced proliferation of T cells and potentiated NTX\" s inhibitory effects on T cells, while pilocarpine only slightly enhanced Con A-induced T cell proliferation and partially reversed the inhibitory effect of NTX. On the other hand, neither nicotine nor mecamylamine had an influence on NTX\"s inhibitory effects on Con A-induced T cell proliferation in vitro. NTX inhibited T cell proliferation by arresting the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase.",
        "Many histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are well recognized as potential anti-cancer drugs. Inhibition of HDACs induces temporal transcription or epigenetic control, thus regulating many different biological responses. Here, we investigated the osteogenic effect of the HDAC inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA; vorinostat).\n\nThe effects of SAHA on osteoblast differentiation were examined in the 6XOSE-Luc reporter assay for determination of runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) activity and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and in an immunoprecipitation assay to determine the Runx2 acetylation state. The osteogenic activity of SAHA in vivo was studied in and receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoporotic mouse model.\n\nSAHA increased the transcriptional activity of Runx2 in a dose-dependent manner in the 6XOSE-Luc reporter assay. SAHA by itself was unable to induce ALP activity; however, SAHA enhanced ALP activity induced by bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2). The degree of acetylation of Runx2 was increased with SAHA treatment, which suggests that the increase in Runx2 transcriptional activity might be dependent on stabilization by acetylation. Also, SAHA successfully reversed soluble RANKL-induced osteoporotic bone loss.",
        "Accelerated aging has been proposed as a pathologic mechanism of various chronic diseases, including COPD. This concept has almost exclusively been approached by analyses of individual markers. We investigated whether COPD is associated with accelerated aging using a panel of markers representing various interconnected aspects of the aging process.\n\nLung function, leukocyte telomere length, lymphocyte gene expression of anti-aging (sirtuin 1, total klotho, and soluble klotho [Sklotho]), senescence (p16/21), and DNA repair (Ku70/80 and TERF2) proteins, and markers of systemic inflammation and oxidative stress were determined in 160 patients with COPD, 82 smoking subjects, and 38 never-smoking control subjects.\n\nMedian levels for telomere length, Sklotho, Ku70, and sirtuin 1 gene expression were lower (respectively, 4.4, 4.6, and 4.7 kbp for telomere length; 74%, 82%, and 100%\\xa0for Sklotho; 88%, 92%, and 100%\\xa0for Ku70 and 70%, 92%, and 100%\\xa0for sirtuin 1, all P\\xa0< .05) in patients compared with the smoking and never-smoking control groups. P21 gene expression was higher in patients compared with smoking control subjects. Telomere length correlated with Ku70 gene expression (r\\xa0= 0.15, P\\xa0= .02). After correction for age, smoking history, systemic inflammation, and oxidative stress, telomere length and p21 were the only markers that remained independently associated with lung function. In separate groups, only telomere length remained associated with lung function parameters.",
        "Leishmania (L.) tropica is the causative agent of different forms of human leishmaniasis. There is little information about the role of Leishmania-specific antibodies in the immune response against L. tropica infection. The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of Leishmania-specific antibodies and their immunoglobulin G (IgG) isotypes in L. tropica infection.\n\nL. tropica at two different doses (high dose, 10\n\nOur data showed that (1) a higher parasite dose results in higher levels of antibody. (2) L. tropica infection results in a lower IgG1 antibody response, compared with L. major infection. (3) The IgG2a/IgG1 antibody response in L. tropica infection is higher than that in L. major infection.",
        "Spices and herbs are recognized sources of natural antioxidants that can protect from oxidative stress, thus play an important role in chemoprevention of liver diseases. Ginger is used worldwide primarily as a spicy condiment.\n\nThis study evaluated the ability of ginger extract (GE) to ameliorate oxidative-hepatic toxicity induced by lead acetate (PbAc) in rats.\n\nFive groups of animals were used: group I kept as control; groups II, IV, and V received PbAc (1\\u2009ppm in drinking water daily for 6 weeks, and kept for an additional 2 weeks without PbAc exposure); group III treated orally with GE (350\\u2009mg/kg body weight, 4\\u2009d per week) for 6 weeks; group IV (protective) received GE for 2 weeks before and simultaneously with PbAc; and group V (treatment) received GE for 2 weeks after PbAc exposure.\n\nGC-MS analysis of GE revealed its content of gingerol (7.09%), quercetin (3.20%), dl-limonene (0.96%), and zingiberene (0.18%). Treatment of PbAc-treated rats with GE has no effect on hepatic Pb concentrations. However, it maintained serum aspartate aminotransferase level, increased hepatic glutathione (157%), glutathione S-transferase (GST) (228%), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) (138%) and catalase (CAT) (112%) levels, and reduced hepatic malondialdehyde (80%). Co-treatment of PbAc group with GE upregulated mRNA expression of antioxidant genes: GST-\u03b11 (1.4-fold), GPx1 (1.8-fold), and CAT (8-fold), while post-treatment with GE upregulated only mRNA expression of GPx1 (1.5-fold).",
        "Grass pollen, in particular from Lolium multiflorum is a major allergen source in temperate climate zones of Southern Brazil. The IgE sensitization profile of Brazilian grass pollen allergic patients to individual allergen molecules has not been analyzed yet.\n\nTo analyze the IgE sensitization profile of a Brazilian grass pollen allergic population using individual allergen molecules.\n\nWe analyzed sera from 78 grass pollen allergic patients for the presence of IgE antibodies specific for 103 purified micro-arrayed natural and recombinant allergens by chip technology. IgE-ELISA inhibition experiments with Lolium multiflorum, Phleum pratense extracts and a recombinant fusion protein consisting of Phl p 1, Phl p 2, Phl p 5 and Phl p 6 were performed to investigate cross-reactivities.\n\nWithin the Brazilian grass pollen allergic patients, the most frequently recognized allergens were Phl p 1 (95%), Phl p 5 (82%), Phl p 2 (76%) followed by Phl p 4 (64%), Phl p 6 (45%), Phl p 11 (18%) and Phl p 12 (18%). Most patients were sensitized only to grass pollen allergens but not to allergens from other sources. A high degree of IgE cross-reactivity between Phleum pratense, Lolium multiflorum and the recombinant timothy grass fusion protein was found.",
        "We found that carbonic anhydrase IV (CA4), a member of the carbonic anhydrases, is silenced in colorectal cancer (CRC). We analysed its epigenetic inactivation, biological effects and prognostic significance in CRC.\n\nThe biological functions of CA4 were determined by in vitro and in vivo tumorigenicity assays. The CA4 co-operator was identified by immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry. CA4 downstream effectors and signalling pathways were elucidated by promoter luciferase assay, electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation. The clinical impact of CA4 was assessed in 115 patients with CRC.\n\nCA4 was silenced in all nine CRC cell lines and 92.6% of CRC tumours. The promoter hypermethylation contributed to the inactivation of CA4, and it was detected in 75.7% of the patients with CRC. After a median follow-up of 49.3\\u2005months, multivariate analysis showed that the patients with CA4 hypermethylation had a recurrence of Stage II/III CRC. The re-expression of CA4 inhibited cell proliferation, induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. CA4 inhibited the activity of the Wnt signalling pathway and mediated the degradation of \u03b2-catenin. CA4 interacted with Wilms\" tumour 1-associating protein (WTAP) and induced WTAP protein degradation through polyubiquitination. Moreover, CA4 promoted the transcriptional activity of Wilms\" tumour 1 (WT1), an antagonist of the Wnt pathway, which resulted in the induction of transducin \u03b2-like protein 1 (TBL1) and the degradation of \u03b2-catenin.",
        "Morphine and fentanyl are opioid analgesics in wide clinical use that act through the \u03bc-opioid receptor (MOR). However, one limitation of their long-term effectiveness is the development of tolerance. Receptor desensitization has been proposed as a putative mechanism driving tolerance to G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) agonists. Recent studies have found that tolerance to morphine is mediated by the c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) signaling pathway. The goal of the present study was to test the hypotheses that: 1) JNK inhibition will be antinociceptive on its own; 2) JNK inhibition will augment morphine antinociception and; 3) JNK mediates chronic tolerance for the antinociceptive effects of morphine using acute (hotplate and tail-flick), inflammatory (10 \u03bcl of formalin 2.5%) and chemotherapy (cisplatin 5 mg/kg ip once weekly)-induced neuropathic pain assays.\n\nWe found that JNK inhibition by SP600125 (3 mg/kg) produces a greater antinociceptive effect than morphine (6 mg/kg) alone in the formalin test. Moreover, co-administration of morphine (6 mg/kg) with SP600125 (3 mg/kg) produced a sub-additive antinociceptive effect in the formalin test. We also show that pre-treatment with SP600125 (3 or 10 mg/kg), attenuates tolerance to the antinociceptive effects of morphine (10 mg/kg), but not fentanyl (0.3 mg/kg), in the tail-flick and hotplate tests. Pre-treatment with SP600125 also attenuates tolerance to the hypothermic effects of both morphine and fentanyl. We also examined the role of JNK in morphine tolerance in a cisplatin-induced model of neuropathic pain. Interestingly, treatment with SP600125 (3 mg/kg) alone attenuated mechanical and cold allodynia in a chemotherapy-induced pain model using cisplatin. Strikingly, SP600125 (3 mg/kg) pre-treatment prolonged the anti-allodynic effect of morphine by several days (5 and 7 days for mechanical and cold, respectively).",
        "Numerous studies have been performed to discover predictive/prognostic biomarkers for human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and cervical cancer development. More recently, microRNAs were suggested as possible biomarkers of HPV-associated cancers and our aim was to characterize the expression of let-7c in exfoliated cervical cells from women with cervical intraepithelial lesions.\n\nLet-7c expression was evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in 73 women with normal or cervical intraepithelial lesions: normal epithelium with (n = 17) and without (n = 21) HPV infection; low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (n = 14); and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (n = 21).\n\nData showed a trend to down-regulation in women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (2(-\u0394\u0394Ct) = 0.38, p = 0.06) and a significant decreased expression of let-7c in women with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (2(-\u0394\u0394Ct) = 0.21; p = 0.004). The combined analysis of all cervical intraepithelial lesions revealed a down-regulation of let-7c expression (2(-\u0394\u0394Ct) = 0.27; p = 0.011).",
        "Adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) often have a less atherogenic-appearing fasting lipid profile than controls, despite increased rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) as adults. We previously reported an atherogenic lipoprotein subfraction cholesterol distribution associated with insulin resistance (IR) in T1D adults. We sought to determine if T1D youth have more atherogenic profile than controls via a cross-sectional study.\n\nFollowing 3 days of controlled diet and restricted exercise, fasting plasma samples were drawn from 28 T1D youth [50% female, age 15.3 \u00b1 2 yr, body mass index (BMI) 48%ile; diabetes duration 73 \u00b1 52 months, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) 8.3 \u00b1 1.4%] and 17 non-diabetic controls (47% female, age: 15.0 \u00b1 2 yr, BMI 49%ile) prior to a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. Lipoproteins were fractionated by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) and lipoprotein cholesterol distribution determined. Outcome measures were IR assessed by glucose infusion rate (GIR) and FPLC lipoprotein subfraction cholesterol distribution.\n\nT1D youth were more IR (GIR 9.1 \u00b1 3.6 vs. 14.7 \u00b1 3.9 mg/kg/min, p < 0.0001) and had more cholesterol distributed as small dense low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and less as large buoyant high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) than controls (p < 0.05), despite no differences in the fasting lipid panel. T1D girls lacked the typical female less-atherogenic profile, whereas control girls tended to have a shift toward less dense LDL-C and HDL-C vs. control boys. Among T1D, IR but not HbA1c was associated with a more atherogenic lipoprotein profile.",
        "Low-grade inflammation is involved in adipose tissue (AT) and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and induces deposition of ECM proteins in AT. We have previously shown that MFAP5 (microfibrillar-associated protein 5) expression decreases in AT after weight loss. The aim of this study was to investigate MFAP5 localization in human AT and gene expression in adipocytes and the role of MFAP5 in adipocyte metabolism and inflammation.\n\nMFAP5 protein localization and gene expression were studied with immunohistochemistry and quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR) in human subcutaneous AT and cultured Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) adipocytes, respectively. The effect of MFAP5 knock-down by siRNA on gene expression and insulin action was examined with RT-qPCR, western blot, and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. The effect of different cytokines on MFAP5 gene and protein expression was investigated in cultured human SGBS preadipocytes.\n\nMFAP5 protein was highly expressed in AT, and gene expression decreased during adipocyte differentiation in SGBS cells. Treatment of preadipocytes with TNF\u03b1 and TGF\u03b21 increased MFAP5 gene and protein expression. Furthermore, MFAP5 knock-down decreased the expression of genes involved in inflammation.",
        "Laccase isoenzymes (LacI,II,III) produced on wheat bran from Trametes hirsuta were partially purified through anion exchange chromatography. The three isoenzymes had the same MW of 65\\xa0kDa, and their main physico-chemical properties were studied. As single isoenzymes, laccases were unable to decolourize dye. Among several mediators evaluated, syringaldehyde was the most effective in dye decolourization (100%). A remarkable increase in dye decolourization was observed when LacI, II, III in mixture or crude enzyme were added to the reaction system, indicating that the laccases acted synergistically.",
        "To define the DNA methylation landscape of neuroblastoma and its clinicopathological impact.\n\nMicroarray DNA methylation data were analyzed and associated with functional/regulatory genome annotation data, transcriptional profiles and clinicobiological parameters.\n\nDNA methylation changes in neuroblastoma affect not only promoters but also intragenic and intergenic regions at cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) and non-CpG sites, and target functional chromatin domains of development and cancer-related genes such as CCND1. Tumors with diverse clinical risk showed differences affecting CpG and, remarkably, non-CpG sites. Non-CpG methylation observed essentially in clinically favorable cases was associated with the differentiation status of neuroblastoma and expression of key genes such as ALK.",
        "In adults undergoing gastric bypass surgery, it is routine practice to perform pre-operative testing for Helicobacter pylori infection. Evidence suggests that infection impairs anastomotic healing and contributes to complications. There currently are no data for adolescents undergoing bariatric procedures. Despite few patients with pre-operative symptoms, we noted occasional patients with H. pylori detected after sleeve gastrectomy. We reviewed our experience with our adolescent sleeve gastrectomy cohort to determine the prevalence of H. pylori infection, its predictive factors, and association with outcomes. We hypothesized that H. pylori infection would be associated with pre-operative symptoms, but not surgical outcomes.\n\nAll patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy at our hospital were included. We conducted a chart review to determine pre- or post-operative symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease GERD or gastritis, operative complications, and long-term anti-reflux therapy after surgery. Pathology reports were reviewed for evidence of gastritis and H. pylori infection.\n\n78 adolescents had laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy from January 2010 through July 2014. The prevalence of chronic gastritis was 44.9% (35/78) and 11.4% of those patients had H. pylori (4/35). Only one patient with H. pylori had pre-operative symptoms, and only 25.7% (9/35) of patients with pathology-proven gastritis had symptoms. One staple line leak occurred but this patient did not have H. pylori or gastritis. Mean patient follow-up was 10 (3-26) mos.",
        "Carcinomas and their metastases often retain the keratin patterns of their epithelial origin, and are therefore useful as lineage-specific markers in diagnostic pathology. Recently, it has become clear that intermediate filaments composed by keratins play a role in modulation of cell proliferation, migration, and possibly cancer invasion, factors impacting prognosis in early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\n\nTumor tissue from a retrospective Danish cohort of 177 patients with completely resected NSCLC, stage I-IIIA tumors, were analyzed for keratin 7 (K7) and keratin 34\u03b2E12 expression by immunohistochemistry and validated in a comparable independent Norwegian cohort of 276 stage I-IIIA NSCLC patients.\n\nBased on keratin 34\u03b2E12/K7 expression, three subgroups with significantly different median cancer-specific survival rates were identified (34\u03b2E12+/K7+, 168 months vs. 34\u03b2E12+/K7+, 73 months vs. 34\u03b2E12-/K7+, 30 months; p = 0.0004). In multivariate analysis, stage II-IIIA (HR 2.9), 34\u03b2E12+/K7+ (HR 1.90) and 34\u03b2E12-/K7+ (HR 3.7), were prognostic factors of poor cancer-specific survival (CSS) (p < 0.001). Validation in the Norwegian cohort confirmed that stage II-IIIA (HR 2.3), 34\u03b2E12+/K7+ (HR 1.6), and 34\u03b2E12-/K7+ (HR 2.0) were prognostic factors of poor CSS (p < 0.05). Multivariate Cox proportional-hazard analysis demonstrated that 34\u03b2E12+/K7 + and 34\u03b2E12+/K7 + status was significantly associated with poor overall survival (p < 0.05).",
        "Familial glucocorticoid deficiency (FGD) reflects specific failure of adrenocortical glucocorticoid production in response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Most cases are caused by mutations encoding ACTH-receptor components (MC2R, MRAP) or the general steroidogenesis protein (StAR). Recently, nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT) mutations were found to cause FGD through a postulated mechanism resulting from decreased detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in adrenocortical cells.\n\nIn a consanguineous Palestinian family with combined mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid deficiency, whole-exome sequencing revealed a novel homozygous NNT_c.598 G>A, p.G200S, mutation. Another affected, unrelated Palestinian child was also homozygous for NNT_p.G200S. Haplotype analysis showed this mutation is ancestral; carrier frequency in ethnically matched controls is 1/200. Assessment of patient fibroblasts for ROS production, ATP content and mitochondrial morphology showed that biallelic NNT mutations result in increased levels of ROS, lower ATP content and morphological mitochondrial defects.",
        "At present there is still controversy about the relationship between emotional stress and psoriasis lesions. Most of the published literature does not include the broad spectrum of emotional response.\n\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the association between skin lesions and emotional state in a large sample of patients with psoriasis.\n\n823 psoriasis patients were recruited (mean age 45.9 years, 55.7% female) and answered two online questionnaires: lesion severity and current extension were evaluated using a self-administered psoriasis severity index (SAPASI); emotional state was assessed using the positive and negative affect schedule (PANAS). Second order factors were calculated and correlated with the SAPASI.\n\nWe found positive associations between the extent and severity of skin lesions and the negative and submissive emotions, a negative correlation with dominance emotions and no association with positive emotions.",
        "Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) at high altitude is not well understood to date. This study investigates the effects of high altitude on ICH, and examines the acute neuroprotection of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy against high-altitude ICH.\n\nMinipigs were placed in a hypobaric chamber for 72 h before the operation. ICH was induced by an infusion of autologous arterial blood (3 ml) into the right basal ganglia. Animals in the high-altitude ICH group received HBO therapy (2.5 ATA for 60 min) 30 min after ICH. Blood gas, blood glucose and brain tissue oxygen partial pressure (PbtO2) were monitored continuously for animals from all groups, as were microdialysis products including glucose, lactate, pyruvate and glutamate in perihematomal tissue from 3 to 12 h post-ICH.\n\nHigh-altitude ICH animals showed significantly lower PbtO2, higher lactate/pyruvate ratio (LPR) and glutamate levels than low-altitude ICH animals. More severe neurological deficits, brain edema and neuronal damage were also observed in high-altitude ICH. After HBO therapy, PbtO2 was significantly increased and LPR and glutamate levels were significantly decreased. Brain edema, neurological deficits and neuronal damage were also ameliorated.",
        "One of the early hallmarks of osteoarthritis (OA) is a progressive degeneration of the articular cartilage. Early diagnosis of OA-associated cartilage alterations would be beneficial for disease prevention and control, and for the development of disease-modifying treatments. However, early diagnosis is still hampered by a lack of quantifiable readouts in preclinical models.\n\nIn this study, we have shown the potency of contrast-enhanced nanofocus x-ray computed tomography (CE-nanoCT) to be used for virtual 3-dimensional (3D) histopathology in established mouse models for OA, and we compared with standard histopathology.\n\nWe showed the equivalence of CE-nanoCT images to histopathology for the modified Mankin scoring of the cartilage structure and quality. Additionally, a limited set of 3D cartilage characteristics measured by CE-nanoCT image analysis in a user-independent and semiautomatic manner, that is, average and maximum of the noncalcified cartilage thickness distribution and loss in glycosaminoglycans, was shown to be predictive for the cartilage quality and structure as can be evaluated by histopathological scoring through the use of an empirical model.",
        "To investigate the application value of empty puparia in species identification of common sarcosaphagous flies.\n\nFifty-five samples of adult flies and their empty puparia were collected. All the samples were identified as 2 families, 6 genera and 8 species by morphological characteristics. The samples were divided into 3 groups according to their time period between eclosion and our analyses: less than 2 years (n = 23), 2-5 years (n = 20), and more than 5 years (n = 12). The mtDNA of each sample was extracted by CTAB method. The purity and concentration of DNA were tested. PCR products were amplified using two sets of primers. Two sequences of CO I gene (sequence I: 498 bp, sequence II : 841 bp) from each sample were compared to the sequences in GenBank using BLAST for species identification.\n\nThe mtDNA was extracted successfully from all the samples. DNA concentration of adult chest muscle preserved less than or equal to 5 years and empty puparia preserved less than 2 years ranged from 1.0 to 3.0 \u00b5g/\u00b5l, and the value of A260/A280 ranged from 1.6 to 1.8. The purity and concentration was lower than 1.6 and 1.0 \u00b5g/\u00b5l, when the adult chest muscle and empty puparia preserved more than 5 years and 2 years, respectively. DNA concentration of the samples significantly decreased with the prolonged preservation time (P < 0.01). Two sequences of CO I gene was amplified in adult chest muscle and empty puparia which preserved less than 2 years. The success rates of amplification decreased with the prolonged preservation time, especially for the sequence II (P < 0.01). The morphological identification of 8 species did not match exactly with the results based on the COI gene, correct species identification occurred in 6 and 7 species out of 8 based on the two sequences, respectively, and their Max ident value exceeded 97%",
        "Mechanisms that regulate regeneration of injured livers are complex. YAP, a stem cell associated factor, controls liver growth in healthy adult mice. Increasing nuclear localization of YAP triggers accumulation of reactive-appearing ductular cells (YAP+RDC) with liver progenitor capabilities. The significance of YAP activation, and mechanisms involved, are unknown in diseased livers. We evaluated the hypothesis that YAP is more activated in injured livers that are scarring than in those that are regenerating effectively.\n\nImmunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR analysis were used to localize and quantify changes in YAP and RDC in 52 patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and two mouse models of diet-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Results were correlated with liver disease severity, metabolic risk factors, and factors proven to control NAFLD progression.\n\nYAP increased in NAFLD where it mainly localized in nuclei of RDC that expressed progenitor markers. Accumulation of YAP+RDC paralleled the severity of hepatocyte injury and accumulation of Sonic hedgehog, but not steatosis or metabolic risk factors. YAP+RDC expressed osteopontin, a Shh-regulated fibrogenic factor. Myofibroblast accumulation, fibrosis, and numbers of YAP+RDC strongly correlated. In murine NASH models, atrophic fibrotic livers contained significantly more YAP+RDC than livers with less severe NASH.",
        "Somatic mutations occur at early stages of adenoma and accumulate throughout colorectal cancer progression. The aim of this study was to characterize the mutational landscape of stage II tumors and to search for novel recurrent mutations likely implicated in colorectal cancer tumorigenesis.\n\nThe exomic DNA of 42 stage II, microsatellite-stable colon tumors and their paired mucosae were sequenced. Other molecular data available in the discovery dataset [gene expression, methylation, and copy number variations (CNV)] were used to further characterize these tumors. Additional datasets comprising 553 colorectal cancer samples were used to validate the discovered mutations.\n\nAs a result, 4,886 somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNV) were found. Almost all SNVs were private changes, with few mutations shared by more than one tumor, thus revealing tumor-specific mutational landscapes. Nevertheless, these diverse mutations converged into common cellular pathways, such as cell cycle or apoptosis. Among this mutational heterogeneity, variants resulting in early stop codons in the AMER1 (also known as FAM123B or WTX) gene emerged as recurrent mutations in colorectal cancer. Losses of AMER1 by other mechanisms apart from mutations such as methylation and copy number aberrations were also found. Tumors lacking this tumor suppressor gene exhibited a mesenchymal phenotype characterized by inhibition of the canonical Wnt pathway.",
        "The response rate of first-line fluoropyrimidine-based regimens for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is generally less than 50\\xa0%. The down-regulation of miR-197 in colorectal cancer cells after exposure to 5-fluorouracil might be related to the mechanism of resistance to fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. So we investigated the regulatory mechanism of miR-197 on 5-FU sensitivity.\n\nDual luciferase reporter gene construct and dual luciferase reporter assay were used to identify the target of miR-197. TYMS expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry staining. 5-Fu resistance of colorectal cancer cell lines was detected by MTS assay. The expression of miR-197 was detected by real time PCR.\n\nA luciferase assay and western blot analysis confirmed that miR-197 directly binds to and negatively regulates TYMS expression. Overexpressing miR-197 could increase the sensitivity of colorectal cancer cells to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The expression of miR-197 negatively correlated with TYMS expression in cancerous tissues from patients with stage IV colorectal cancer.",
        "More than 1 in 10 infants are born prematurely worldwide, making preterm birth the leading cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity. Chronic maternal stress is increasingly recognized as one of the contributing risk factors for preterm birth, yet its specific role remains largely unknown. Examining the exposure to stressors over a mother\"s life course might provide more perspective on the role of maternal stress in preterm birth. Our aim was therefore to retrospectively explore the associations between chronic, lifelong stressors and protective factors and spontaneous preterm birth.\n\nThis study was part of a large case-control study based in Edmonton, Canada, examining gene-environment interactions and preterm birth. Cases were mothers with a spontaneous singleton preterm birth (<37 weeks) without preterm premature rupture of membranes. Controls were mothers with an uncomplicated singleton term birth without a history of preterm birth. Sociodemographic and medical data were collected. A postpartum telephone questionnaire was administered to assess stressors across the lifespan. Both individual and contextual variables that could influence stress response systems were examined. Overall, 622 women were included, of which 223 subjects - 75 cases and 148 controls - completed the stress questionnaire. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed.\n\nMultivariate analysis showed that exposure to two or more adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) was associated with a two-fold risk of preterm birth, regardless of maternal age, smoking status, educational status, and history of miscarriage (adjusted OR, 2.09; 95 % CI, 1.10-3.98; P = 0.024). The adjusted odds ratio for the ACE score was 1.18 (95 % CI, 0.99-1.40), suggesting that for every increase in childhood adverse event endorsed, the risk of preterm birth increased by 18 %. Lifetime physical and emotional abuse was also associated with spontaneous preterm birth in our study population (adjusted OR, 1.30; 95 % CI, 1.02-1.65; P = 0.033).",
        "Differentiation of metazoan cells requires execution of different gene expression programs but recent single-cell transcriptome profiling has revealed considerable variation within cells of seeming identical phenotype. This brings into question the relationship between transcriptome states and cell phenotypes. Additionally, single-cell transcriptomics presents unique analysis challenges that need to be addressed to answer this question.\n\nWe present high quality deep read-depth single-cell RNA sequencing for 91 cells from five mouse tissues and 18 cells from two rat tissues, along with 30 control samples of bulk RNA diluted to single-cell levels. We find that transcriptomes differ globally across tissues with regard to the number of genes expressed, the average expression patterns, and within-cell-type variation patterns. We develop methods to filter genes for reliable quantification and to calibrate biological variation. All cell types include genes with high variability in expression, in a tissue-specific manner. We also find evidence that single-cell variability of neuronal genes in mice is correlated with that in rats consistent with the hypothesis that levels of variation may be conserved.",
        "The hand hygiene technique that the World Health Organization recommends for cleansing hands with soap and water or alcohol-based handrub consists of 7 poses. We used an automated training system to improve clinicians\" hand hygiene technique and test whether this affected hospitalwide hand hygiene compliance.\n\nSeven hundred eighty-nine medical and nursing staff volunteered to participate in a self-directed training session using the automated training system. The proportion of successful first attempts was reported for each of the 7 poses. Hand hygiene compliance was collected according to the national requirement and rates for 2011-2014 were used to determine the effect of the training system on compliance.\n\nThe highest pass rate was for pose 1 (palm to palm) at 77% (606 out of 789), whereas pose 6 (clean thumbs) had the lowest pass rate at 27% (216 out of 789). One hundred volunteers provided feedback to 8 items related to satisfaction with the automated training system and most (86%) expressed a high degree of satisfaction and all reported that this method was time-efficient. There was no significant change in compliance rates after the introduction of the automated training system. Observed compliance during the posttraining period declined but increased to 82% in response to other strategies.",
        "This study investigates the role of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) in the regulation of migratory and invasive mechanisms in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).\n\nInvasion, migration, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, -3 and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP-3) expression, \u03b2-integrin binding, cytoskeletal rearrangement and Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) activation in response to a TLR2-ligand, Pam3CSK4 (1 \u03bcg/ml), in ex vivo RA synovial tissue explants, primary RA synovial fibroblasts (RASFC) and microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC) were assessed by Transwell Matrigel\u2122 invasion chambers, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), multiplex adhesion binding assay, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), F-actin immunofluorescent staining, matrigel synovial outgrowths, Rac1 pull-down assays/Western blot and zymography. \u03b21-integrin expression in RA/control synovial tissue was assessed by immunohistology. The effect of Pam3CSK4 on cell migration, invasion, MMP-3 and Rac1 activation was examined in the presence or absence of anti-\u03b21-integrin (10 \u03bcg/ml) or anti-IgG control (10 \u03bcg/ml). The effect of an anti-TLR-2 mAb (OPN301)(1 \u03bcg/ml) or immunoglobulin G (IgG) control (1 \u03bcg/ml) on RASFC migration and RA synovial tissue MMP activity was assessed by wound assays, ELISA and zymography.\n\nPam3CSK4 significantly induced cell migration, invasion, MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression and induced the MMP-1/TIMP-3 and MMP-3/TIMP-3 ratio in RASFC and explants (p <0.05). \u03b21-integrin expression was significantly higher in RA synovial tissue compared to controls (p <0.05). Pam3CSK4 specifically induced \u03b21-integrin binding in RASFC (p <0.05), with no effect observed for \u03b22-4, \u03b26, \u03b1v\u03b25 or \u03b15\u03b21. Pam3CSK4 increased \u03b21-integrin mRNA expression, Rac1 activation, RASFC outgrowths and altered cytoskeletal dynamic through induction of filopodia formation. Pam3CSK4-regulated cell migration and invasion processes, but not MMP-3, were inhibited in the presence of anti-\u03b21-integrin (p <0.05), with no effect observed for anti-IgG control. Furthermore, anti-\u03b21-integrin inhibited Pam3CSK4-induced Rac1 activation. Finally, blockade of TLR2 with OPN301 significantly decreased spontaneous release of MMP-3, MMP-2 and MMP-9 and increased TIMP-3 secretion from RA synovial explant cultures (p <0.05). Incubation of RASFC with OPN301 RA ex vivo conditioned media inhibited migration and invasion compared to IgG control.",
        "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can differentiate into chondroblasts, adipocytes, or osteoblasts under appropriate stimulation. Ghrelin, an endogenous ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR), stimulates growth hormone (GH) secretion, and has both orexigenic and adipogenic effects. This study sought to understand the potential involvement of members of MAPK serine/threonine kinases in the ghrelin-induced growth of rabbit MSCs ( rBMSC).\n\nWe applied various concentrations of ghrelin to cultured rBMSC and observed the growth rate of the cells by MTT, changes in the phosphorylation state of ERK1/2, JNK and p38, and the expression levels of ALP, Runx2, and Osterix by wetern blot.\n\nWe found that the growth and osteogenic differentiation of ghrelin-treated rBMSC are promoted primarily by phosphorylated ERK1/2, and that this phosphorylation, as well p38 phosphorylation, is mediated by GHSR.",
        "Several diseases have been related to asbestos exposure, including the pleural tumor mesothelioma. The mechanism of pleural injury by asbestos fibers is not yet fully understood. The inflammatory response with release of mediators leading to a dysregulation of apoptosis may play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of asbestos-induced pleural disease.\n\nTo determine whether pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by asbestos-exposed pleural mesothelial cells modify the injury induced by the asbestos.\n\nMouse pleural mesothelial cells (PMC) were exposed to crocidolite or chrysotile asbestos fibers (3.0 \u03bcg/cm(2)) for 4, 24, or 48 h and assessed for viability, necrosis and apoptosis, and the production of cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2). Cells exposed to fibers were also treated with antibodies anti-IL-1\u03b2, anti-IL-6, anti- IL-1\u03b2+anti-IL-6 or anti-MIP-2 or their irrelevant isotypes, and assessed for apoptosis and necrosis. Non-exposed cells and cells treated with wollastonite, an inert particle, were used as controls.\n\nMesothelial cells exposed to either crocidolite or chrysotile underwent both apoptosis and necrosis and released cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and MIP-2. In the crocidolite group, apoptosis and the levels of all cytokines were higher than in the chrysotile group, at comparable concentrations. Neutralization of IL-1\u03b2 andIL-6, but not MIP-2, inhibited apoptosis and necrosis, especially in the cells exposed to crocidolite fibers.",
        "It has been reported that the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) can be measured relatively easily and can serve as a valuable index for much clinical pathology. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between NLR and hepatic histological findings in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).\n\nA total of 226 consecutive patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD [nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH, n=105), borderline-NASH (n=74), and simple steatosis (n=47)] were enrolled. NASH and fibrosis were diagnosed histologically using the NAFLD Clinical Research Network criteria.\n\nSignificant differences were found in aspartate aminotransferase (P<0.001), alanine aminotransferase (P<0.001) levels, and white blood cell (P=0.007) and neutrophil counts (P=0.042) between the three groups of patients. In addition, significantly higher BMI (P=0.024), waist circumference (P=0.011), aspartate aminotransferase (P=0.003), alanine aminotransferase (P=0.005), insulin (P=0.008), and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (P=0.009) levels were found in patients with fibrosis (n=133) in comparison with those without fibrosis (n=93). There was no correlation between NLR and glucose, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance, lipid parameters, and the NAFLD activity score. Analysis of the NLR in relation to histological findings also showed no association between these parameters.",
        "Metastasectomy can provide durable disease control for selected patients with metastatic melanoma. Vemurafenib is a BRAF kinase inhibitor which has demonstrated significant improvement in disease-specific survival in patients with metastatic melanoma with a BRAF gene mutation. This study examined the efficacy and safety of metastasectomy during treatment with vemurafenib.\n\nA retrospective review was performed of all patients receiving vemurafenib at Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre. Patient records were reviewed to identify patients undergoing surgery within 30 days of vemurafenib therapy. Descriptive statistics and survival analysis were performed.\n\nNineteen patients underwent 21 metastasectomies including craniotomy (57%), spinal decompression (14%), small bowel resection (14%), lung resection (9.5%) and neck dissection (4.5%). Indications for surgery were: an isolated residual focus of disease (n\\u2009=\\u20092); isolated progressive disease in the setting of stability elsewhere (n\\u2009=\\u20099); and symptomatic disease (n\\u2009=\\u20098). Grade 2 or higher surgical complications occurred in 19% of cases and there was one peri-operative death. Median post-operative survival was seven months. There was a trend toward improved post-operative survival for patients with longer duration of vemurafenib therapy (P\\u2009=\\u20090.04) and for those undergoing elective surgery (P\\u2009=\\u20090.07).",
        "To investigate the mechanism of immune response in mouse macrophage induced by Pneumococcal heat shock protein 40 (HSP40).\n\nAfter recombinant HSP40 (rHSP40) underwent expression detection and purification, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was removed from it. Then rHSP40 was used to stimulate bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) derived from C57BL/6 wild-type mice. The mRNA levels of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-1\u03b2, IL-23p19, IL-12p40, IL-12p35 and IL-10 in BMDMs were determined by reverse transcription PCR; the expressions of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-12p40 were measured by ELISA. After stimulated by rHSP40, the levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 expressed by wide-type, TLR2-/- and TLR4-/- BMDMs were detected by ELISA. The effects of the pretreatment of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) inhibitors on the secretion of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 induced by rHSP40 were also evaluated by ELISA in BMDMs. The phosphorylation levels of p38MAPK and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) were determined by Western blotting.\n\nThe rHSP40 protein reached a purity of more than 90%. It significantly enhanced the phosphorylation levels of p38MAPK and JNK as well as the expressions of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6. The p38MAPK and JNK inhibitors significantly suppressed the expressions of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6. The expressions of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in TLR4-/- BMDMs significantly decreased compared with wide-type BMDMs.",
        "Isoflurane may be protective in preclinical models of lung injury, but its use in patients with lung injury remains controversial and the mechanism of its protective effects remains unclear. The authors hypothesized that this protection is mediated at the level of alveolar tight junctions and investigated the possibility in a two-hit model of lung injury that mirrors human acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\nWild-type mice were treated with isoflurane 1\\u2009h after exposure to nebulized endotoxin (n = 8) or saline control (n = 9) and then allowed to recover for 24\\u2009h before mechanical ventilation (MV; tidal volume, 15\\u2009ml/kg, 2\\u2009h) producing ventilator-induced lung injury. Mouse lung epithelial cells were similarly treated with isoflurane 1\\u2009h after exposure to lipopolysaccharide. Cells were cyclically stretched the following day to mirror the MV protocol used in vivo.\n\nMice treated with isoflurane following exposure to inhaled endotoxin and before MV exhibited significantly less physiologic lung dysfunction. These effects appeared to be mediated by decreased vascular leak, but not altered inflammatory indices. Mouse lung epithelial cells treated with lipopolysaccharide and cyclic stretch and lungs harvested from mice after treatment with lipopolysaccharide and MV had decreased levels of a key tight junction protein (i.e., zona occludens 1) that was rescued by isoflurane treatment.",

From trimmed paired-end sequences >400 bp, 484 microsatellite loci were identified. Twelve of 48 microsatellite loci tested were found to be polymorphic and consistently scorable when screened on 53 individuals from four populations representing the geographic range of M. drucei. They also amplify in all other species in the M. pygmaea species group, i.e., M. antarctica, M. brevis, M. glauca, and M. pygmaea, as well as 18 other Myosotis species.",
        "To evaluate the correlation of epicardial adipose tissue volume (EATV) with the coronary artery lesion and its severity.\n\nInpatients with suspicious stable angina of coronary heart lesion were recruited. For patients with coronary artery lesions in CTA, further coronary angiography (CAG) was performed to evaluate the coronary artery lesion. Gensini scoring system was employed to assess the severity of coronary artery lesions.\n\nPatients were classified as coronary heart disease (CHD) group (n = 160). Results showed the mean EATV was 192.57 \u00b1 30.32 cm(3) in CHD group, which was significantly larger than that in control group (138.56 \u00b1 23.18 cm(3); P < 0.01). The coronary artery stenosis was classified as mild, moderate and severe stenosis according to the extent of coronary artery lesions, and results showed marked difference in the EATV among patients with different severities of coronary artery stenosis (P < 0.005). The Gensini score was positively related to EATV (r = 0.285, P = 0.000). The EATV increased with the increase in the number of affected coronary arteries. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed EATV was an independent risk factor of CHD after adjusting other confounding factors (OR = 1.023, P = 0.013).",
        "Improvement of transduction and augmentation of cytotoxicity are crucial for adenoviruses (Ad)-mediated gene therapy for cancer. Down-regulated expression of type 5 Ad (Ad5) receptors on human tumors hampered Ad-mediated transduction. Furthermore, a role of the p53 pathways in cytotoxicity mediated by replication-competent Ad remained uncharacterized.\n\nWe constructed replication-competent Ad5 of which the E1 region genes were activated by a transcriptional regulatory region of the midkine or the survivin gene, which is expressed preferentially in human tumors. We also prepared replication-competent Ad5 which were regulated by the same region but had a fiber-knob region derived from serotype 35 (AdF35). We examined the cytotoxicity of these Ad and a possible combinatory use of the replication-competent AdF35 and Ad5 expressing the wild-type p53 gene (Ad5/p53) in esophageal carcinoma cells. Expression levels of molecules involved in cell death, anti-tumor effects in vivo and production of viral progenies were also investigated.\n\nReplication-competent AdF35 in general achieved greater cytotoxic effects to esophageal carcinoma cells than the corresponding replication-competent Ad5. Infection with the AdF35 induced cleavages of caspases and increased sub-G1 fractions, but did not activate the autophagy pathway. Transduction with Ad5/p53 in combination with the replication-competent AdF35 further enhanced the cytotoxicity in a synergistic manner. We also demonstrated the combinatory effects in an animal model. Transduction with Ad5/p53 however suppressed production of replication-competent AdF35 progenies, but the combination augmented Ad5/p53-mediated p53 expression levels and the downstream pathways.",
        "Response time variability (RTV) is consistently increased in patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). A right-hemispheric frontoparietal attention network model has been implicated in these patients. The 3 main connecting fibre tracts in this network, the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) and the cingulum bundle (CB), show microstructural abnormalities in patients with ADHD. We hypothesized that the microstructural integrity of the 3 white matter tracts of this network are associated with ADHD and RTV.\n\nWe examined RTV in adults with ADHD by modelling the reaction time distribution as an exponentially modified Gaussian (ex-Gaussian) function with the parameters \u03bc, \u03c3 and \u03c4, the latter of which has been attributed to lapses of attention. We assessed adults with ADHD and healthy controls using a sustained attention task. Diffusion tensor imaging-derived fractional anisotropy (FA) values were determined to quantify bilateral microstructural integrity of the tracts of interest.\n\nWe included 100 adults with ADHD and 96 controls in our study. Increased \u03c4 was associated with ADHD diagnosis and was linked to symptoms of inattention. An inverse correlation of \u03c4 with mean FA was seen in the right SLF of patients with ADHD, but no direct association between the mean FA of the 6 regions of interest with ADHD could be observed.",
        "Transforming growth factor/Smad family member 3 (TGF)-\u03b2/Smad3 signalling is essential for maintaining articular cartilage. A relationship between the genetic variants of TGF-\u03b2 itself, TGF-\u03b2 signalling and binding molecules, and osteoarthritis (OA) has been reported. Although variants of candidate genes have become prime targets for genetic analysis, their detailed interplay has not been documented. Our goal was to establish whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of TGF-\u03b21, TGF-\u03b2RI, Smad3 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 3 (TIMP3), and their interactions, are associated with knee OA.\n\nWe performed a case-control association study and genotyped 518 knee patients with OA and 468 healthy controls. All participants were genotyped for TGF-\u03b21 (rs1800469C/T), TGF-\u03b2RI (rs1590A/G), Smad3 (rs12901499A/G and rs6494629T/C), and TIMP3 (rs715572G/A and rs1962223G/C) polymorphisms by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) was used to identify gene-gene interactions.\n\nSignificant associations were observed for TIMP3 rs715572G/A polymorphisms in knee patients with OA and healthy individuals. The GA heterozygote in TIMP3 (rs715572G/A) was significantly associated with OA (p=0.007). Patient stratification using the Kellgren-Lawrence grading scale showed significant differences in TIMP3 rs715572G/A genotypes between grade 4 knee OA and controls. By MDR analysis, a two-locus model (Smad3 rs6494629T/C and TIMP3 rs715572G/A) of gene-gene interaction was the best for predicting knee OA risk, and its maximum testing accuracy was 57.55% and maximum cross-validation consistency was 10/10.",
        "Clone libraries provide researchers with a powerful resource to study nucleic acid from diverse sources. Metagenomic clone libraries in particular have aided in studies of microbial biodiversity and function, and allowed the mining of novel enzymes. Libraries are often constructed by cloning large inserts into cosmid or fosmid vectors. Recently, there have been reports of GC bias in fosmid metagenomic libraries, and it was speculated to be a result of fragmentation and loss of AT-rich sequences during cloning. However, evidence in the literature suggests that transcriptional activity or gene product toxicity may play a role.\n\nTo explore possible mechanisms responsible for sequence bias in clone libraries, we constructed a cosmid library from a human microbiome sample and sequenced DNA from different steps during library construction: crude extract DNA, size-selected DNA, and cosmid library DNA. We confirmed a GC bias in the final cosmid library, and we provide evidence that the bias is not due to fragmentation and loss of AT-rich sequences but is likely occurring after DNA is introduced into Escherichia coli. To investigate the influence of strong constitutive transcription, we searched the sequence data for promoters and found that rpoD/\u03c3(70) promoter sequences were underrepresented in the cosmid library. Furthermore, when we examined the genomes of taxa that were differentially abundant in the cosmid library relative to the original sample, we found the bias to be more correlated with the number of rpoD/\u03c3(70) consensus sequences in the genome than with simple GC content.",
        "The human activation peptide of factor XIII (AP-FXIII) comprises the first 37 amino acids of the N-terminus and holds the FXIII in an inactive state. FXIII is activated either proteolytically by cleavage of AP-FXIII by thrombin, or non-proteolytically by high calcium concentrations.\n\nTo investigate the role of AP-FXIII in the expression and stability of FXIII.\n\nWe cloned 13 FXIII variants with progressive\\xa0truncations of AP-FXIII from the N-terminus (delN-FXIII-A), expressed them in mammalian cells, and measured their thermostability, activation, and transglutaminase activity. We also used in silico calculations to analyze the stability of hypothetical delN-FXIII dimers and to identify crucial motifs within AP-FXIII.\n\nVariants with deletions longer than the first 10 amino acids and an R11Q point mutant were not expressed as proteins. In silico calculations indicated that the sequence (8) FGGR(12) R plays a substantial role in intersubunit interactions in FXIII-A2 homodimers. In agreement with this prediction, the temperature stability of delN-FXIII variants decreased with increasing length of deletion. These results may suggest a role of the N-terminus of AP-FXIII in dimer stability. Substantial sequence homology was found among activation peptides of vertebrate and even invertebrate (crustacean) FXIII-A orthologs, which further supports our conclusion.",
        "The human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum has a complex and multi-stage life cycle that requires extensive and precise gene regulation to allow invasion and hijacking of host cells, transmission, and immune escape. To date, the regulatory elements orchestrating these critical parasite processes remain largely unknown. Yet it is becoming increasingly clear that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) could represent a missing regulatory layer across a broad range of organisms.\n\nTo investigate the regulatory capacity of lncRNA in P. falciparum, we harvested fifteen samples from two time-courses. Our sample set profiled 56 h of P. falciparum blood stage development. We then developed and validated strand-specific, non-polyA-selected RNA sequencing methods, and pursued the first assembly of P. falciparum strand-specific transcript structures from RNA sequencing data. This approach enabled the annotation of over one thousand lncRNA transcript models and their comprehensive global analysis: coding prediction, periodicity, stage-specificity, correlation, GC content, length, location relative to annotated transcripts, and splicing. We validated the complete splicing structure of three lncRNAs with compelling properties. Non-polyA-selected deep sequencing also enabled the prediction of hundreds of intriguing P. falciparum circular RNAs, six of which we validated experimentally.",
        "Use of analgesics has been associated with lower risk of ovarian cancer, but, to date, very few studies have explored the association between analgesics and ovarian cancer survival.\n\nWe examined the relationship between self-reported prediagnostic use of aspirin, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen and overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), ascites at the time of primary treatment, and persistence of disease after primary treatment among 699 women diagnosed with epithelial ovarian carcinoma. The associations between use of these medications and OS and PFS were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. We utilized unconditional logistic regression models to estimate associations between medication use and presence of ascites and persistence of disease.\n\nPrediagnostic intake of aspirin, both low-dose and regular-dose, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen was not associated with any of the outcomes of interest.",
        "Heart rate (HR) parameters are known indicators of cardiovascular complications after cardiac surgery, but there is little evidence of their role in predicting outcome after major vascular surgery. The purpose of this study was to determine whether arrival HR (AHR) and highest intraoperative HR are associated with mortality or major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) after elective vascular surgery in the Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI).\n\nPatients undergoing elective lower extremity bypass (LEB), aortofemoral bypass (AFB), and open abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair in the VQI were analyzed. MACE was defined as any postoperative myocardial infarction, dysrhythmia, or congestive heart failure. Controlled HR was defined as AHR <75 beats/min on operating room arrival. Delta HR (DHR) was defined as highest intraoperative HR - AHR. Procedure-specific MACE models were derived for risk stratification, and generalized estimating equations were used to account for clustering of center effects. HR, beta-blocker exposure, cardiac risk, and their interactions were explored to determine association with MACE or 30-day mortality. A Bonferroni correction with P < .004 was used to declare significance.\n\nThere were 13,291 patients reviewed (LEB, n = 8155 [62%]; AFB, n = 2629 [18%]; open AAA, n = 2629 [20%]). Rates of any preoperative beta-blocker exposure were as follows: LEB, 66.5% (n = 5412); AFB, 57% (n = 1342); and open AAA, 74.2% (n = 1949). AHR and DHR outcome association was variable across patients and procedures. AHR <75 beats/min was associated with increased postoperative myocardial infarction risk for LEB patients across all risk strata (odds ratio [OR], 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.9; P = .03), whereas AHR <75 beats/min was associated with decreased dysrhythmia risk (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.28-0.63; P = .0001) and 30-day death (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.33-0.77; P = .001) in patients at moderate and high cardiac risk. These HR associations disappeared in controlling for beta-blocker status. For AFB and open AAA repair patients, there was no significant association between AHR and MACE or 30-day mortality, irrespective or cardiac risk or beta-blocker status. DHR and extremes of highest intraoperative HR (>90 or 100 beats/min) were analyzed among all three operations, and no consistent associations with MACE or 30-day mortality were detected.",
        "Genome-wide association study (GWAS) is a powerful tool to identify novel pharmacogenetic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) are a major class of asthma medications, and genetic factors contribute to variable responses to these drugs. We used GWAS to identify novel SNPs associated with the response to the LTRA, montelukast, in asthmatics.\n\nUsing genome-wide genotype and phenotypic data available from American Lung Association - Asthma Clinical Research Center (ALA-ACRC) cohorts, we evaluated 8-week change in FEV1 related to montelukast administration in a discovery population of 133 asthmatics. The top 200 SNPs from the discovery GWAS were then tested in 184 additional samples from two independent cohorts.\n\nTwenty-eight SNP associations from the discovery GWAS were replicated. Of these, rs6475448 achieved genome-wide significance (combined P = 1.97 x 10-09), and subjects from all four studies who were homozygous for rs6475448 showed increased \u0394FEV1 from baseline in response to montelukast.",
        "Increasing evidence has shown that protein tyrosine phosphatases have dominant roles in setting the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation and promoting oncogenic processes. PTP4A3 has been implicated in cancer metastasis but to our knowledge the role of PTP4A3 in upper tract urothelial carcinoma is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of PTP4A3 with disease characteristics, distant metastasis and prognosis of upper tract urothelial carcinoma.\n\nThe importance of PTP4A3 was initially examined in paired normal urothelium, noninvasive upper tract urothelial carcinoma, invasive upper tract urothelial carcinoma and nodal metastatic tissue. The PTP4A3 transcript level was assessed in another 20 upper tract urothelial carcinoma samples by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. PTP4A3 protein expression was determined by immunohistochemistry using the H-score in 340 upper tract urothelial carcinoma samples. It was further correlated with clinicopathological factors, and disease specific and metastasis-free survival.\n\nThe expression of PTP4A3 significantly increased from normal urothelium, noninvasive upper tract urothelial carcinoma and invasive upper tract urothelial carcinoma to nodal metastatic tissue (p <0.001). The PTP4A3 transcript level was also markedly up-regulated in higher stage upper tract urothelial carcinoma (p = 0.002). Over expression of PTP4A3 protein was significantly associated with advanced pT status, nodal metastasis, lymphovascular invasion and perineural invasion (each p <0.001) as well as with inferior disease specific and metastasis-free survival on multivariate analysis (each p\\xa0<0.0001). In addition, it predicted metastasis in patients with pTa, pT1 and pT2 upper tract urothelial carcinoma.",
        "The mucin MUC1, best known for providing an epithelial barrier, is an important protective host factor in both humans and mice during Helicobacter pylori pathogenesis. This study aimed to identify the long-term consequences of MUC1 deficiency on H. pylori pathogenesis and the mechanism by which MUC1 protects against H. pylori gastritis.\n\nWildtype and Muc1(-/-) mice were infected for up to 9\\u2005months, and the gastric pathology, immunological response and epigenetic changes assessed. The effects of MUC1 on the inflammasome, a potent inflammatory pathway, were examined in macrophages and H. pylori-infected mice deficient in both MUC1 and inflammasome components.\n\nMuc1(-/-) mice began to die 6\\u2005months after challenge, indicating Muc1 deficiency made H. pylori a lethal infection. Surprisingly, chimaeric mouse infections revealed MUC1 expression by haematopoietic-derived immune cells limits H. pylori-induced gastritis. Gastritis in infected Muc1(-/-) mice was associated with elevated interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and epigenetic changes in their gastric mucosa similar to those in transgenic mice overexpressing gastric IL-1\u03b2, implicating MUC1 regulation of an inflammasome. In support of this, infected Muc1(-/-)Casp1(-/-) mice did not develop severe gastritis. Further, MUC1 regulated Nlrp3 expression via an nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB-dependent pathway and reduced NF-\u03baB pathway activation via inhibition of IRAK4 phosphorylation. The importance of this regulation was proven using Muc1(-/-)Nlrp3(-/-) mice, which did not develop severe gastritis.",
        "Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution and variations in ambient temperature have been linked to increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, no large-scale study has assessed their effects on directly measured aerobic functional capacity among high-risk patients.\n\nUsing a cross-sectional observational design, we evaluated the effects of ambient PM2.5 and temperature levels over 7\\u2005days on cardiopulmonary exercise test results performed among 2078 patients enrolling into a cardiac rehabilitation programme at the University of Michigan (from January 2003 to August 2011) using multiple linear regression analyses (controlling for age, sex, body mass index).\n\nPeak exercise oxygen consumption was significantly decreased by approximately 14.9% per 10 \u03bcg/m(3) increase in ambient PM2.5 levels (median 10.7 \u03bcg/m(3), IQR 10.1 \u03bcg/m(3)) (lag days 6-7). Elevations in PM2.5 were also related to decreases in ventilatory threshold (lag days 5-7) and peak heart rate (lag days 2-3) and increases in peak systolic blood pressure (lag days 4-5). A 10\u00b0C increase in temperature (median 10.5\u00b0C, IQR 17.5\u00b0C) was associated with reductions in peak exercise oxygen consumption (20.6-27.3%) and ventilatory threshold (22.9-29.2%) during all 7 lag days. In models including both factors, the outcome associations with PM2.5 were attenuated whereas the effects of temperature remained significant.",
        "We minimized the influence of image quality variability, as measured by signal strength (SS), on optical coherence tomography (OCT) thickness measurements using the histogram matching (HM) method.\n\nWe scanned 12 eyes from 12 healthy subjects with the Cirrus HD-OCT device to obtain a series of OCT images with a wide range of SS (maximal range, 1-10) at the same visit. For each eye, the histogram of an image with the highest SS (best image quality) was set as the reference. We applied HM to the images with lower SS by shaping the input histogram into the reference histogram. Retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness was automatically measured before and after HM processing (defined as original and HM measurements), and compared to the device output (device measurements). Nonlinear mixed effects models were used to analyze the relationship between RNFL thickness and SS. In addition, the lowest tolerable SSs, which gave the RNFL thickness within the variability margin of manufacturer recommended SS range (6-10), were determined for device, original, and HM measurements.\n\nThe HM measurements showed less variability across a wide range of image quality than the original and device measurements (slope = 1.17 vs. 4.89 and 1.72 \u03bcm/SS, respectively). The lowest tolerable SS was successfully reduced to 4.5 after HM processing.",
        "Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a soft tissue sarcoma associated with the skeletal muscle lineage. Of the two predominant subtypes, known as embryonal (eRMS) and alveolar (aRMS), aRMS has the poorer prognosis, with a five-year survival rate of <50%. The majority of aRMS tumors express the fusion protein PAX3-FOXO1. As PAX3-FOXO1 has proven chemically intractable, this study aims to identify targetable proteins that are downstream from or cooperate with PAX3-FOXO1 to support tumorigenesis.\n\nMicroarray analysis of the transcriptomes of human skeletal muscle myoblasts expressing PAX3-FOXO1 revealed alteration of several Wnt pathway gene members, including secreted frizzled related protein 3 (SFRP3), a secreted Wnt pathway inhibitor. Loss-of-function using shRNAs against SFRP3 was used to interrogate the role of SFRP3 in human aRMS cell lines in vitro and conditional murine xenograft systems in vivo. The combination of SFRP3 genetic suppression and the chemotherapeutic agent vincristine was also examined.\n\nIn vitro, suppression of SFRP3 inhibited aRMS cell growth, reduced proliferation accompanied by a G1 arrest and induction of p21, and induced apoptosis. In vivo, doxycycline-inducible suppression of SFRP3 reduced aRMS tumor growth and weight by more than three-fold, in addition to increasing myogenic differentiation and \u03b2-catenin signaling. The combination of SFRP3 suppression and vincristine was more effective at reducing aRMS cell growth in vitro than either treatment alone, and ablated tumorigenesis in vivo.",
        "Although a previous study reported nerve ending-derived acetylcholine promoted prostate cancer invasion and metastasis by regulating the microenvironment of cancer cells, the present study aims to determine whether there is autocrine cholinergic signaling in prostate epithelial cells that promotes prostate cancer growth and castration resistance.\n\nIn this study, IHC was performed to detect protein expression in mouse prostate tissue sections and human prostate cancer tissue sections. Subcutaneously and orthotopically xenografted tumor models were established to evaluate the functions of autocrine cholinergic signaling in regulating prostate cancer growth and castration resistance. Western blotting analysis was performed to assess the autocrine cholinergic signaling-induced signaling pathway.\n\nWe found the expression of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), the secretion of acetylcholine and the expression of CHRM3 in prostate epithelial cells, supporting the presence of autocrine cholinergic signaling in the prostate epithelium. In addition, we found that CHRM3 was upregulated in clinical prostate cancer tissues compared with adjacent non-cancer tissues. Overexpression of CHRM3 or activation of CHRM3 by carbachol promoted cell proliferation, migration, and castration resistance. On the contrary, blockading CHRM3 by shRNA or treatment with darifenacin inhibited prostate cancer growth and castration resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we found that autocrine cholinergic signaling caused calmodulin/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaM/CaMKK)-mediated phosphorylation of Akt.",
        "Female gender has been reported to be a risk factor for graft loss after liver transplantation for hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related cirrhosis but evidence is limited to retrospective studies.\n\nTo investigate the impact of recipient gender and donor/recipient gender mismatch on graft outcome.\n\nWe performed a survival analysis of a cohort of 1530 first adult transplants enrolled consecutively in Italy between 2007 and 2009 and followed prospectively. After excluding possible confounding factors (fulminant hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus co-infection, non-viremic anti-HCV positive subjects), a total of 1394 transplant recipients (604 HCV-positive and 790 HCV-negative) were included.\n\nFive-year graft survival was significantly reduced in HCV-positive patients (64% vs 76%, p=0.0002); Cox analysis identified recipient female gender (HR=1.44, 95% CI 1.03-2.00, p=0.0319), Mayo clinic End stage Liver Disease score (every 10 units, HR=1.25, 95% CI 1.03-1.50; p=0.022), portal thrombosis (HR=2.40, 95% CI 1.20-4.79, p=0.0134) and donor age (every 10 years, HR=1.14, 95% CI 1.05-1.24, p=0.0024) as independent determinants of graft loss. All additional mortality observed among female recipients was attributable to severe HCV recurrence.",
        "The spinal curvature in patients with Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) causes an asymmetry of upper body postural alignment, which might affect postural balance. However, the currently available studies on balance in AIS patients are not consistent. Furthermore, it is not known whether potential deficits are similar between patients with single and double curves. Finally, the effects of a corrective posterior spinal fusion on postural balance have not yet been well established.\n\nPostural balance was tested on a force plate, in 26 female subjects with AIS (12-18 years old; preoperative Cobb-angle: 42-71\u00b0; single curve n\\u2009=\\u200918, double curve n\\u2009=\\u20096) preoperatively, at 3\\xa0months and 1\\xa0year postoperatively. We also conducted a balance assessment in 18 healthy age-matched female subjects. Subjects were tested during quiet double-leg standing in four conditions (eyes open/closed; foam/solid surface), while standing on one leg, while performing a dynamic balance (weight shifting) task and while performing a reaching task in four directions.\n\nAIS subjects did not demonstrate greater COP velocities than controls during the double-leg standing tasks. In the reaching task, however, they achieved smaller COP displacements than healthy controls, except in the anterior direction. AIS patients with double curves had significantly greater COP velocities in all test conditions compared to those with a single curve (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05). For the AIS group, a slight increase in COP velocities was observed in the foam eyes closed and right leg standing condition at 3\\xa0months post surgery. At 1-year post surgery, however, there were no significant differences in any of the outcome measures compared to the pre-surgery assessment, irrespective of the curve type.",
        "Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) incidence increases, maybe due to increasing prevalences of obesity and diabetes. Concurrent hyperinsulinemia might promote carcinogenesis via the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-1R). Expression of the IGF-1R was studied in correlation with diabetes and prognostic parameters.\n\nPatients with EAC undergoing esophagectomy were prospectively selected. From resected tumors a tissue microarray was constructed. Immunohistochemistry evaluated IGF-1R-expression. Logistic-, cox regression models and survival analyses assessed if diabetes and IGF-1R-expression were associated with prognostic parameters. IGF-1R-expression in normal and Barrett tissues was studied.\n\nAbsence or low IGF-1R-expression was associated with T3-, grade 3 tumors and R1 resections (P\\u2009=\\u20090.001, P\\u2009=\\u20090.025, P\\u2009<\\u20090.001, respectively). Logistic regression showed that this was associated with R1 resections (HR 0.24, 95%CI 0.11-0.52). Diabetes was not associated with IGF-1R-expression (P\\u2009=\\u20090.612). Absence or low IGF-1R-expression decreased 5-year overall survival (P\\u2009=\\u20090.023) univariably, but not multivariably. IGF-1R-expression was present in Barrett tissues, but diminished in high-grade dysplasia.",
        "The evolutionary basis of reproductive success in different environments is of major interest in the study of plant adaptation. Since the reproductive stage is particularly sensitive to drought, genes affecting reproductive success during this stage are key players in the evolution of adaptive mechanisms. We used an ecological genomics approach to investigate the reproductive response of drought-tolerant and sensitive wild barley accessions originating from different habitats in the Levant.\n\nWe sequenced mRNA extracted from spikelets at the flowering stage in drought-treated and control plants. The barley genome was used for a reference-guided assembly and differential expression analysis. Our approach enabled to detect biological processes affecting grain production under drought stress. We detected novel candidate genes and differentially expressed alleles associated with drought tolerance. Drought associated genes were shown to be more conserved than non-associated genes, and drought-tolerance genes were found to evolve more rapidly than other drought associated genes.",
        "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a leading cause of cancer death. Smoking, diabetes, and pancreatitis are risk factors. It has been shown that the growth of PDAC and pancreatic duct epithelial cells is regulated by beta-adrenoreceptors (beta-ARs). The activity of beta-ARs in the central nervous system is counteracted by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) via GABA B receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. The aim of the study was to investigate if GABA B R inhibits beta-AR signaling in PDAC and pancreatic duct epithelial cells, thus blocking driving forces of cancer progression, such as cell proliferation and cell migration.\n\nIntracellular cAMP was measured by immunoassays, DNA synthesis by BrdU incorporation assays, activation of ERK1/2 by ERK activation assays, and Western blots and metastatic potential by cell migration assays in the human PDAC cell lines PANC-1 and BXPC-3 and immortalized human pancreatic duct epithelial cells HPDE6-C7. The expression of norepinephrine, PKAR IIalpha, and GABA in PDAC microarrays was assessed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS.: Stimulation of the GABA B R by GABA or baclofen inhibited isoproterenol-induced cAMP signaling below base levels. ERK1/2 activity in response to isoproterenol was blocked by GABA, an effect enhanced by transient overexpression of the GABA B R and abolished by GABA B R knockdown. DNA synthesis and cell migration were stimulated by isoproterenol, responses blocked by GABA and baclofen. Norepinephrine and PKAR IIalpha were overexpressed while GABA was underexpressed in human PDAC tissue arrays.",
        "This study evaluated the association of a polymorphism in the CD40 gene with BMD and risk of osteopenia or osteoporosis in a population of 602 postmenopausal women. Results showed that women with the TT genotype had lower BMD at femoral neck and spine sites and increased risk of osteopenia or osteoporosis.\n\nRecent findings have demonstrated that the CD40/CD40L system, which is of main importance for the immune system, can also be implied in the regulation of bone metabolism. The main objective of the present work has been to clarify whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting genes of CD40/CD40L system could be linked with abnormalities in the level of bone mineral density (BMD) in menopausal women.\n\nWe performed an association study of BMD values with a SNP located at position -1 of the Kozak consensus sequence of CD40 gene (rs1883832; C>T) in a population of 602 postmenopausal women.\n\nWomen with the TT genotype (8.6% of women) displayed a reduction in femoral neck BMD (FN BMD) and lumbar spine BMD (LS BMD) of 6.2% and of 6.3%, respectively, as compared to women with CC + CT genotype. Logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, weight, and height showed that women with the TT genotype had increased risk for FN (odds ratio: 2.34; 95% CI: 1.12-4.89) and LS (odds ratio: 2.49; 95% CI: 1.19-5.24) osteopenia or osteoporosis.",
        "Chronic stroke survivors with low hip bone density are particularly prone to fractures. This study shows that fear of falling is independently associated with falls in this population. Thus, fear of falling should not be overlooked in the prevention of fragility fractures in these patients.\n\nChronic stroke survivors with low bone mineral density (BMD) are particularly prone to fragility fractures. The purpose of this study was to identify the determinants of balance, mobility and falls in this sub-group of stroke patients.\n\nThirty-nine chronic stroke survivors with low hip BMD (T-score <-1.0) were studied. Each subject was evaluated for the following: balance, mobility, leg muscle strength, spasticity, and fall-related self-efficacy. Any falls in the past 12 months were also recorded. Multiple regression analysis was used to identify the determinants of balance and mobility performance, whereas logistic regression was used to identify the determinants of falls.\n\nMultiple regression analysis revealed that after adjusting for basic demographics, fall-related self-efficacy remained independently associated with balance/mobility performance (R2 = 0.494, P < 0.001). Logistic regression showed that fall-related self-efficacy, but not balance and mobility performance, was a significant determinant of falls (odds ratio: 0.18, P = 0.04).",
        "Apoptosis has been implicated in renal ischemic injury, the regulating mechanism of which is still unclear. Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) participate in inflammation, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis. In the in vitro model of renal ischemic injury, we explored the role of the STAT3, a major component of the STAT family, in apoptosis of human proximal tubular epithelial cell (HKC) induced by ATP depletion/recovery.\n\nApoptosis of HKC was induced in an in vitro model of acute renal failure. STAT3 activation was analyzed by Western blotting. RNA interference was used to knock down STAT3 expression. The effect of STAT3 knockdown or STAT3C overexpression on apoptosis was assessed by annexin V binding and propidium iodide uptake.\n\nSTAT3 was phosphorylated during the course of ATP depletion-induced HKC cell apoptosis. STAT3 knockdown suppressed STAT3 phosphorylation, and promoted apoptosis of HKC subjected to ATP depletion/recovery, while STAT3C overexpression conferred resistance of HKC to ATP depletion-induced apoptosis.",
        "To assess the false-positive rate of breast cancer surveillance by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in BRCA mutation carriers and the impact of an abnormal mammography or breast MRI on the patients\" decision for prophylactic mastectomy.\n\nA total of 196 BRCA mutation carriers were included with a median follow-up of 2 years (range 1-9) with annual mammography and MRI. Preference for prophylactic mastectomy was registered at first surveillance after the mutation carriership was revealed.\n\nIn all, 41% (81 of 196) of the women had at least one positive MRI or mammography. Malignancy was detected in 17 women: 11 at surveillance, 4 at an intended prophylactic mastectomy and 2 had an interval cancer. Imaging by mammography and MRI had a sensitivity of 71% and a specificity of 90%. The probability that a positive MRI result is false positive was 83%. In the group with a prior preference for mastectomy with and without a false-positive imaging, prophylactic mastectomy was carried out in 89% and 66%, respectively (P = 0.06), in the group with prior preference for surveillance these percentages were 15% and 11%, respectively (P = 0.47).",
        "An inverse association either between depression or impaired functional status and quality of life (QoL) has been reported for cancer patients, but the independent effect of depression or depressive symptoms and of functional impairment on QoL is unclear.\n\nWe investigated the prevalence of depression or depressive symptoms with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the functional impairment with the ECOG-Performance-Status (ECOG-PS) and the QoL with the EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire in a sample of 175 hospitalised cancer patients prior to the start of chemotherapy.\n\nSixteen of 175 patients (9.1%) screened positive for major depression, 29 (16.6%) had mild to moderate depressive symptoms. In 11 of 15 scales of the EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire depression or depressive symptoms were significantly associated with worse QoL in univariate analysis and in 12 of 15 scales poor ECOG-PS was significantly associated with worse QoL. In multivariate analysis including ECOG-PS and BDI, the effect of depression and/ or depressive symptoms on QoL was persistent in seven scales: global QoL, physical- and role functioning, fatigue, nausea & vomiting, pain, and constipation, that of ECOG-PS in five scales: global QoL, emotional functioning, nausea & vomiting, pain, and appetite loss.",
        "Intrathecal inflammation has been suggested to play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer\"s disease (AD). However, there is little clinical evidence in support of this hypothesis in AD patients. We previously reported that the blood-brain barrier permeability represented by the cerebrospinal fluid/serum albumin ratio correlates with medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) in AD. The aim of this study was to elucidate the relationship between intrathecal inflammation and the severity of AD.\n\nWe investigated the correlations between the cerebrospinal fluid/serum IgG index and the indices of AD severity, including Clinical Dementia Rating and Mini-Mental State Examination, and MTA on magnetic resonance imaging in 42 AD patients. Further, the number of apolipoprotein E isoforms and the blood-brain barrier permeability were also examined for the correlation with the IgG index.\n\nThe IgG index showed a positive correlation with the severity of MTA but not with the other parameters examined.",
        "The relationship between subcortical ischemic vascular disease (SIVD) and cognition in normal elderly is unclear, in part because of methodological inconsistencies across studies. To clarify this relationship, the current study investigated a well characterized cognitively normal elderly sample (>or=55 years) with quantitative MRI and psychometrically robust neuropsychological measures within a multivariate model. Converging evidence suggests that SIVD selectively impairs frontal-executive tasks by disrupting frontal-subcortical circuits. We therefore hypothesized that MRI markers of SIVD would be selectively associated with worse executive functioning.\n\nWe studied 94 participants who were cognitively and functionally normal. Volumetric measures of white matter signal hyperintensity (WMH), subcortical lacunes, hippocampal volume, and cortical gray matter were obtained to predict performance on composite measures of executive functioning and episodic memory.\n\nHierarchical regression demonstrated that after controlling for demographic variables, MMSE, and total intracranial volume, the total number of subcortical lacunes was the only significant predictor, with a greater number of lacunes associated with poorer executive performance. Hippocampal volume best predicted episodic memory performance.",
        "Although patients should know the level of training of the physician providing their care in teaching hospitals, many do not.\n\nThe objective of this study is to determine whether the manner by which physicians introduce themselves to patients is associated with patients' misperception of the level of training of their physician.\n\nThis was an observational study of 100 patient-physician interactions in a teaching emergency department.\n\nResidents introduced themselves as a doctor 82% of the time but identified themselves as a resident only 7% of the time. While attending physicians introduced themselves as a \"doctor\" 64% of the time, only 6% identified themselves as the supervising physician. Patients felt it was very important to know their physicians' level of training, but most did not.",
        "To assess changes in the Fe and vitamin A status of the population of Nangweshi refugee camp associated with the introduction of maize meal fortification.\n\nPre- and post-intervention study using a longitudinal cohort.\n\nNangweshi refugee camp, Zambia.\n\nTwo hundred and twelve adolescents (10-19 years), 157 children (6-59 months) and 118 women (20-49 years) were selected at random by household survey in July 2003 and followed up after 12 months.\n\nMaize grain was milled and fortified in two custom-designed mills installed at a central location in the camp and a daily ration of 400 g per person was distributed twice monthly to households as part of the routine food aid ration. During the intervention period mean Hb increased in children (0.87 g/dl; P < 0.001) and adolescents (0.24 g/dl; P = 0.043) but did not increase in women. Anaemia decreased in children by 23.4% (P < 0.001) but there was no significant change in adolescents or women. Serum transferrin receptor (log10-transformed) decreased by -0.082 microg/ml (P = 0.036) indicating an improvement in the Fe status of adolescents but there was no significant decrease in the prevalence of deficiency (-8.5%; P = 0.079).

        "Diminished myocardial sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) activity and upregulated phospholamban (PLB) level during cardiac dysfunction, had been reported in many studies.\n\nThe current study was designed to examine the effects of rAAV-antisense phospholamban (asPLB) gene transfer on cardiac function, SERCA expression and activity, as well as PLB expression and phosphorylation (Pser16-PLB), in a rat myocardial infarction (MI) model.\n\nRat MI model was generated by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery. Four weeks later, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP), the maximal rates of increase and decrease in intraventricular pressure (+/-dp/dt(max)) were significantly depressed, and left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was increased. Myocardial PLB was markedly increased while both SERCA activity and Pser16-PLB level were decreased. In rAAV-asPLB transfected rats, rAAV-asPLB, which was injected into the myocardium around the infarction area immediately after the coronary artery ligation, effectively attenuated the depression of cardiac function, significantly inhibited the expression of PLB, restored Pser16-PLB level and enhanced myocardium SERCA activity.",
        "Our previous studies have demonstrated that oxidative DNA injury occurs in the brain after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). We therefore examined whether edaravone, a free-radical scavenger, could reduce ICH-induced brain injury.\n\nThese experiments used pentobarbital-anesthetized, male Sprague-Dawley rats that received an infusion of either 100 microL autologous whole blood (ICH), FeCl(2), or thrombin into the right basal ganglia. The rats were humanely killed 24 hours later. There were 4 sets of experiments. In the first, the dose-dependent effects of edaravone on ICH-induced brain injury were examined by measuring brain edema and neurologic deficits. In the second set, apurinic/apyrimidinic abasic sites and 8-hydroxyl-2\"-deoxyguanosine, which are hallmarks of DNA oxidation, were investigated after treatment for ICH. In the third, the effect of delayed treatment with edaravone on ICH-induced injury was determined, whereas the fourth examined the effects of edaravone on iron- and thrombin-induced brain injury.\n\nSystemic administration of edaravone immediately or 2 hours after ICH reduced brain water content 24 hours after ICH compared with vehicle (P<0.05). Edaravone treatment immediately or 2 hours after ICH also ameliorated neurologic deficits (P<0.05). Edaravone also attenuated ICH-induced changes in apurinic/apyrimidinic abasic sites and 8-hydroxyl-2\"-deoxyguanosine and reduced iron- and thrombin-induced brain injury.",
        "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is produced by almost all cancer cells and VEGF receptor 1 (R1) (Flt-1) is abundantly expressed on human monocytes. In the present study, we investigated whether VEGF affects the antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) of human monocytes mediated by trastuzumab.\n\nHER-2-expressing tumor cell lines (MKN-7, TE-4 and SKOV-3) were evaluated for trastuzumab-mediated ADCC of human monocytes in the presence of VEGF(165). The trastuzumab-mediated, monocyte-derived ADCC were treated with the anti-human blocking VEGF R1 or VEGF R2 mAb. VEGF-induced intracellular signaling on monocytes was quantified with ELISA kits.\n\nVEGF partially inhibited the ADCC of human monocytes mediated by trastuzumab. The VEGF-induced deficiency of human monocytes for ADCC was completely recovered by the anti-human blocking VEGF R1 mAb, while the anti-VEGF R2 blocking mAb did not have any effect. Furthermore, VEGF treatment enhanced the phospho-Erk 1/2 in human monocytes.",
        "The objective of this study was to determine the effects and potential mechanisms of C-reactive protein (CRP) on cholesterol efflux from human macrophage foam cells, which may play a critical role in atherogenesis.\n\nHuman THP-1 monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were preincubated with acetylated LDL and [3H]-cholesterol to form foam cells, which were then treated with apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) or HDL for cholesterol efflux assay. Clinically relevant concentrations of CRP significantly reduced cholesterol efflux from THP-1 and PBMCs to apoA-I or HDL. CRP significantly decreased the expression of ATP-binding membrane cassette transporter A-1 (ABCA1) and ABCG1, whereas it increased superoxide anion production. Furthermore, CRP substantially activated ERK1/2 in THP-1-derived foam-like cells. Reducing superoxide anion by antioxidant seleno-L-methionine or SOD mimetic (MnTBAP) effectively abolished the CRP-induced decrease in cholesterol efflux and the expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1. Inhibiting ERK1/2 activation by its specific inhibitor PD98059 or by a dominant negative mutant of ERK2 could also block CRPs action on THP-1 cells.",
        "The liver X receptors (LXRs) regulate a set of genes involved in lipid metabolism and reverse cholesterol transport. We investigated the mechanism by which shear stress regulates LXR in vascular endothelial cells (ECs).\n\nWestern blot showed that the protein level of LXRalpha and its target ABCA1 in the mouse thoracic aorta was higher than that in the aortic arch. As well, the mRNA level of LXR and its target genes ABCA1, ABCG1, ApoE, and LPL in the thoracic aorta was higher. In vitro, bovine aortic ECs were subjected to a steady laminar flow (12 dyne/cm2). The expressions of LXR and the LXR-mediated transcription were increased by laminar shear stress. Laminar flow increased LXR-ligand binding and the gene expression of sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27), which suggests an increased level of LXR ligand in ECs. This effect was attenuated by LXRalpha and CYP27 RNAi. The decrease of LXR in the aorta of PPARgamma+/- mice and that of C57 mice fed with PPARgamma antagonist suggest the involvement of PPARgamma in the LXR induction by flow.",
        "Nonhyperlipidemic postinfarction patients are at high risk for recurrent coronary events by virtue of incident myocardial infarction (MI); however, few studies assess risk beyond incident MI. The aim of this study was to assess such risk as a function of 37 atherosclerosis-associated genetic polymorphisms and 17 blood marker variables.\n\nScreening of polymorphisms in nonhyperlipidemic postinfarction patients revealed significant risk only for the 4G/5G insertion/deletion polymorphism in the promoter of the plasminogen-activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) gene. Outcome event mapping, an exploratory data analysis tool, was then applied to define a subgroup (182 patients from total study population of 846 nondiabetic patients) exhibiting maximal functional dependence of risk on the PAI-1 polymorphism. Cox multivariable regression analyses within the subgroup adjusted for significant clinical covariates and medication use as a function of the PAI-1 polymorphism and 17 atherosclerosis-associated blood markers revealed significant risk for patients homozygous for the 4G allele (hazard ratio 4.30, 95% CI 1.98 to 9.33, P=0.00023), and lack of significant risk-association with any blood marker.",
        "Gammadelta T cells share with natural killer (NK) cells many effector capabilities and cell-surface proteins, including the NKG2 receptor family. A subset of gammadelta T cells that express the variable Vdelta1 region plays a critical role in immune regulation, tumour surveillance and viral infection. Dramatic expansion of Vdelta1 T cells has been observed in HIV disease.\n\nTo determine if NKG2C expression on Vdelta1 T cells during HIV-1 infection is correlated with CD4 cell count and involved in lysis of CD4 T cells.\n\ngammadelta T cells from viraemic HIV-infected patients were examined. Expression of NK cell markers was analyzed by flow cytometry. The cytolytic activity of Vdelta1 T cells was determined by either Cr-release assays or degranulation assays against HLA-E-transfected 721.221 cells or HIV-infected CD4 primary T cells.\n\nThe expression of C-type lectin NKG2 receptors was sharply modulated on gammadelta T cells in patients with HIV infection. A profound decrease of Vdelta1 T cells bearing inhibitory NKG2A receptors corresponded to a drastic expansion of a distinct population of Vdelta1 T cells expressing a functional activating NKG2C receptor. Engagement of HLA-E, the ligand of both NKG2A and NKG2C, which is specifically induced on HIV-infected CD4 T cells, substantially enhanced the Vdelta1 T cell-mediated cytotoxicity.",
        "External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for rectal cancer unavoidably delivers significant radiation dose to the prostate gland. The effect of this incidental exposure on subsequent prostate cancer diagnosis was investigated using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry.\n\nMen diagnosed with localized or regional (L/R) rectal cancer from 1988-1997 and treated with EBRT and sphincter-sparing surgery (SSS) were identified. Men treated for L/R rectal cancer with SSS who did not receive EBRT, and men with L/R colon cancer who did not receive EBRT, were studied for comparison. Multiple Primary Standardized Incidence Ratios of observed to expected (O/E) cases of prostate cancer were calculated using SEER*Stat.\n\nIn all, 1574 men with L/R rectal cancer treated with EBRT and SSS were identified. The median age at diagnosis was 64 and median survival was 76 months. Twenty were subsequently diagnosed with prostate cancer, a number significantly less than expected compared with the general population of similar age and race. The ratio of O/E cases was 0.28 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.17, 0.43). In contrast, 3114 men diagnosed with rectal cancer undergoing SSS who were not treated with EBRT and 24,578 men diagnosed with colon cancer who were not treated with EBRT were subsequently diagnosed with prostate cancer at rates similar to the general population (O/E of 0.94 and 1.09).",
        "To evaluate whether a beta2-adrenergic agonist may reduce acute alveolo-capillary barrier alterations during high-volume ventilation.\n\nExperimental study.\n\nAnimal research laboratory.\n\nA total of 48 male Wistar rats.\n\nA zone of alveolar flooding was produced by liquid instillation in a distal airway. Proteins in the instilled solution were traced with 99mTc-albumin. 111In, which binds to transferrin, was injected into the systemic circulation. Terbutaline was administered in the instilled solution or intra-peritoneally. Conventional ventilation was applied for 30 min followed by different ventilation strategies for 90 min: conventional ventilation, high-volume ventilation with or without 6 cmH2O PEEP.\n\nProtein fluxes across the alveolar and microvascular barriers were evaluated by scintigraphy. High-volume ventilation resulted in immediate leakage of 99mTc-albumin from alveolar spaces and increased pulmonary uptake of systemic 111In-transferrin. Terbutaline in the instilled solution and PEEP lessened alveolar 99mTc-albumin leakage and pulmonary 111In-transferrin uptake due to high-volume ventilation, whereas terbutaline given intra-peritoneally only lessened 111In-transferrin uptake. Terbutaline in the instilled solution also lessened the increase in lung wet-to-dry weight ratio due to high-volume ventilation.",
        "Genetic variants of upstream transcription factor 1 (USF1) have previously been associated with dyslipidaemias in family studies. Our aim was to further address the role of USF1 in metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular traits at the population level in a large Swedish male cohort (n=2,322) with multiple measurements for risk factors during 32 years of follow-up.\n\nParticipants, born in 1920-1924, were examined at 50, 60, 70 and 77 years of age. The follow-up period for cardiovascular events was 1970-2002. We genotyped three haplotype tagging polymorphisms capturing the major allelic variants of USF1.\n\nSNP rs2774279 was associated with the metabolic syndrome. The minor allele of rs2774279 was less common among individuals with metabolic syndrome than among healthy controls [p=0.0029 when metabolic syndrome was defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III; p=0.0073 when defined according to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF)]. The minor allele of rs2774279 was also associated with lower BMI, lower fasting glucose values and higher HDL-cholesterol concentrations in longitudinal analyses. With SNP rs2073658, a borderline association with metabolic syndrome was observed (p=0.036, IDF), the minor allele being the risk-increasing allele. The minor allele of rs2073658 also associated with higher total and LDL-cholesterol, apolipoprotein B-100 and lipoprotein(a) concentrations in longitudinal analyses. Importantly, these trends with respect to the allelic variants prevailed throughout the follow-up time of three decades.",
        "Platelets are essential for pulmonary leukocyte recruitment, airway hyperresponsiveness, and bronchial remodeling in animals with allergic inflammation and can be found in bronchoalveolar lavage of sensitized animals. No studies, however, have explored the direct migration of platelets to lungs.\n\nTo assess whether platelets migrate into lung parenchyma in response to inhaled allergen in ovalbumin-sensitized mice; to assess the role of the FcepsilonRI receptor in this phenomenon; and to evaluate whether platelets from patients with asthma, or from sensitized mice, undergo chemotaxis in vitro in response to relevant antigens.\n\nOvalbumin-sensitized wild-type (WT) mice, or FcRgamma(-/-) mice lacking the FcepsilonRIgamma, were challenged with aerosolized allergen and lungs analyzed by platelet-specific immunohistochemistry. In some experiments, mice were depleted of platelets and cross-transfused with either WT or FcRgamma(-/-) platelets to assess the role of platelet FcRgamma(-/-). Chemotaxis of platelets from patients with asthma or from sensitized mice was studied in vitro.\n\nHistology of lungs revealed isolated platelets, migrating out of vessels and localizing underneath the airways after allergen challenge in WT but not in FcRgamma(-/-) mice. Platelets from patients with asthma and from sensitized WT mice, but not from sensitized FcRgamma(-/-) mice, migrated in vitro toward the relevant allergen or an anti-IgE. Platelets from normal mice were found to express FcepsilonRIgamma and platelet-bound IgEs were increased in sensitized mice.",
        "The motilin receptor (MTLR) is an important therapeutic target for treatment of hypomotility disorders. The negative outcome in clinical trials with the motilin agonist, ABT-229, indicated that desensitization may limit the therapeutic usefulness of motilides. We therefore compared the mechanisms involved in the intracellular trafficking of the MTLR after stimulation with motilin, erythromycin-A (EM-A) or ABT-229.\n\nDesensitization was studied by measuring changes in Ca2+ rises and by receptor binding studies in CHO cells co-expressing the Ca2+ indicator apoaequorin and the MTLR, C-terminally tagged with EGFP. Receptor phosphorylation was studied by immunoprecipitation. MTLR-EGFP trafficking to organelles and translocation of beta-arrestins were visualized by fluorescence microscopy.\n\nAgonist-induced desensitization of the MTLR was due to receptor internalization with potencies (p-int50) in the order of: ABT-229 (8.3)>motilin (7.86)>EM-A (4.77) but with no differences in the internalization kinetics (t(1/2): approximately 25 min). The percentage cell surface receptor loss was more profound after exposure to ABT-229 (88+/-1%) than to motilin (63+/-10%) or EM-A (34+/-2%). For motilin and EM-A MTLR phosphorylation probably occurs via G protein-coupled receptor kinases while for ABT-229 phosphorylation was also protein kinase C dependent. All agonists translocated cytosolic beta-arrestin-2 with greater affinity to the plasma membrane than beta-arrestin-1. After internalization the MTLR co-localized with transferrin but not with cathepsin D. After stimulation with motilin and EM-A the t(1/2) for MTLR resensitization was 3h and 1h, respectively but amounted 26h for ABT-229.",
        "Recent studies suggest an increasing prevalence of atypical initial symptoms in patients with celiac disease (CD). The aim of this study was to compare the presenting symptoms of CD at 2 comparable referral institutions in South Florida, and in Ankara, Turkey. We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients with an initial diagnosis of CD by small bowel biopsy during the same (1991 to 2001) 10-year period at Cleveland Clinic Florida and University of Ankara, Turkey. A numerical score was assigned to presenting symptom and signs.\n\nThere were 28 patients in the South Florida group (51% men) and 40 patients in the Turkish group (35% men) (P=NS). The Turkish patients were significantly younger at diagnosis (36+/-2 y vs. US patients 66+/-3 y) (P<0.0001). Typical celiac symptom scores were similar (Turkey 1.1+/-0.2 vs. South Florida 1.3+/-0.3) (P=NS). Atypical symptom scores were significantly higher in the US patients (1.9+/-0.2) versus those from Turkey (1.2+/-0.1) (P<0.01). The Turkish patients were significantly more likely (P<0.01) to present with chronic diarrhea, hypoalbuminemia, and mactocytosis at the time of diagnosis.",
        "The goal of this investigation was to correlate particular age-related structural changes (compaction) to the amount of scatter in rabbit lenses and to determine if significant fiber compaction occurred in the nuclear and inner cortical regions.\n\nNew Zealand White rabbits at 16-20 months old (adult; n = 10) and at 3.5-4 years old (aged; n = 10) were utilized for this study. Immediately after euthanising, scatter was assessed in fresh lenses by low power helium-neon laser scan analysis. Scatter data was analyzed both for whole lenses and regionally, to facilitate correlation with morphometric data. After functional analysis, lenses were fixed and processed for scanning electron microcopy (SEM; right eyes) and light microscopy (LM; left eyes). Morphometric analysis of SEM images was utilized to evaluate compaction of nuclear fibers. Similarly, measurements from LM images were used to assess compaction of inner cortical fibers.\n\nScatter was significantly greater in aged lenses as compared to adult lenses in all regions analyzed, however the difference in the mean was slightly more pronounced in the inner cortical region. The anterior and posterior elliptical angles at 1 mm (inner fetal nucleus) were significantly decreased in aged vs. adult lenses (anterior, p = 0.040; posterior, p = 0.036). However, the average elliptical angles at 2.5 mm (outer fetal nucleus) were not significantly different in adult and aged lenses since all lenses examined had comparable angles to inner fetal fibers of aged lenses, i.e. they were all compacted. In cortical fibers, measures of average cross-sectional fiber area were significantly different at diameters of both 6 and 7 mm as a function of age (p = 0.011 and p = 0.005, respectively). Accordingly, the estimated fiber volume was significantly decreased in aged as compared to adult lenses at both 6 mm diameter (p = 0.016) and 7 mm diameter (p = 0.010).",
        "Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha levels in invasive breast carcinoma have been shown to be an adverse prognostic indicator. Cellular HIF-1alpha activity is regulated by factor-inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (FIH-1). In hypoxia, FIH-1 hydroxylation of Asn803 within the C-terminal transactivation domain does not occur and HIF-1alpha forms a fully active transcriptional complex. The present study investigates the role of FIH-1 in invasive breast carcinoma and its correlation with hypoxia.\n\nMicroarrayed tissue cores from 295 invasive carcinomas were stained for FIH-1, for HIF-1alpha and for carbonic anhydrase 9. FIH-1 expression was correlated with standard clinicopathological parameters and with the expression of the surrogate hypoxic markers HIF-1alpha and carbonic anhydrase 9.\n\nFIH-1 was positive in 239/295 (81%) tumours, 42/295 (14%) exclusively in the nucleus and 54/295 (18%) exclusively in the cytoplasm. Exclusive nuclear FIH-1 expression was significantly inversely associated with tumour grade (P = 0.02) and risk of recurrence (P = 0.04), whereas exclusive cytoplasmic FIH-1 was significantly positively associated with tumour grade (P = 0.004) and carbonic anhydrase 9 expression (P = 0.02). Patients with tumours that excluded FIH-1 from the nucleus had a significantly shorter survival compared with those with exclusive nuclear expression (P = 0.02). Cytoplasmic FIH-1 expression was also an independent poor prognostic factor for disease-free survival.",
        "The use of punctal plugs in the treatment of dry eyes is well established. Anophthalmic patients have less tears in the anophthalmic socket in comparison to their normal side, due to an absent corneal reflex (Lee & Elsie, 1981a,b). Many of those patients complain of dry eye symptoms, even when they are treated with tear replacement therapy. The authors wished to examine whether they could improve their dry socket complaints with punctal plugs.\n\nTo evaluate the clinical efficacy and tolerability of punctal plug (Smart Plugs) insertion in anophthalmic patients with symptoms of dry eye.\n\nInterventional case series. Fifteen anophthalmic patients with dry eye symptoms, a Schirmer test of less than 3 mm and an open lacrimal passage were examined before and after insertion of punctal plugs. The patients were asked for their subjective evaluation of the treatment and were examined to evaluate the change. Schirmer tests were compared. Bacterial cultures were taken at both visits.\n\nSchirmer results of less than 3 mm in the anophthalmic socket were obtained in 75% of patients with dry eyes symptoms; 87% of patients in whom punctal plugs were inserted reported an improvement in dry eye sensation. More than half of the patients demonstrated less discharge (p < or = 0.05). Schirmer tests improved from 1.4 mm to 1.9 mm (p < or = 0.05). Patients with a Schirmer outcome of 2 mm or more tended to have less pathogenic bacterial cultures (p = 0.11).",
        "This study examined whether alpha lipoic acid (ALA), an antioxidant with anti-apoptotic properties, synthesized in mitochondria of endothelial cells, would inhibit intrinsic apoptotic signaling and microvascular endothelial cell hyperpermeability.\n\nRat lung microvascular endothelial cells were transfected with BAK (BH3) peptide (5 microg/mL) or active caspase-3 (5 microg/mL) and were pretreated with ALA (10 and 100 micromol/L). Hyperpermeability was determined using fluorescein isothiocyanate albumin-flux across the cells grown as monolayer. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation was determined using 123 dihydrorhodamine and mitochondrial membrane potential using JC-1. Cytochrome c levels and caspase-3 activity were determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a fluorometric assay, respectively.\n\nALA (100 micromol/L) pretreatment attenuated BAK (BH3)-induced hyperpermeability and ROS formation. ALA restored BAK (BH3)-induced collapse in mitochondrial membrane potential and decreased BAK (BH3)-induced cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activity.",
        "Profiling mRNA levels of 11 informative genes expressed by circulating immune effector cells identifies cardiac allograft recipients at low risk for current moderate-severe acute cellular rejection (ACR).\n\nWe conducted a nested case-control study of 104 cardiac allograft recipients to investigate the association of transcriptional profiles of blood samples with either a future rejection episode within 12 weeks of a baseline clinical sample or persistent histologic quiescence for the same time period.\n\nThe transcription profile yielded a score (0 to 40 scale) of 27.4 +/- 6.3 for future rejectors (n = 39) and 23.9 +/- 7.1 for controls (n = 65) (p = 0.01). In patients who were <or=180 days post-transplant, the gene expression score was 28.4 +/- 4.9 for rejectors (n = 28) and 22.4 +/- 7.5 for controls (n = 48) (p < 0.001). In this period, no samples from patients who went on to reject within 12 weeks had gene expression scores of <20. Differential expression of the gene IL1R2 was significantly associated with future events. Of 33 additional genes profiled, 5 supported corticosteroid-sensitive constituents (IL1R2 and FLT3), whereas 6 supported T-cell activation (PDCD1).",
        "Adenovirus serotype 5 has remained the pre-eminent vector in pre-clinical gene therapy applications in cardiac transplantation. Concerns over the potential effects of adenoviral vectors on the later development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) are addressed in this study.\n\nHearts (n = 22) harvested from Brown Norway rats were perfused ex vivo with either University of Wisconsin (UW) solution with no virus, Ad-CMV-LacZ or Ad-CMV-Null. Donor hearts were transplanted heterotopically into the abdomen of Lewis rats. All recipients received cyclosporine for the duration of the experiment. Transplanted hearts were recovered for analysis at 120 days. Sections of the heart were stained with elastic-van Gieson stain for morphometric analysis of the vessels to ascertain the degree of vascular luminal occlusion. Hematoxylin-eosin staining facilitated diagnosis of chronic rejection.\n\nSeventy-seven percent of transplanted hearts showed signs of chronic rejection with no difference in the proportion of animals between groups (p = 0.797). No difference was noted in the degree of vascular luminal occlusion between the Ad-Null (0.57 +/- 0.22), Ad-LacZ (0.62 +/- 0.19) and UW (0.47 +/- 0.29) groups (p = 0.653).",
        "The purpose of this study was to identify which characteristics of a multidimensional sequence containing motor, spatial, and temporal elements would be most salient for motor sequence learning and whether age might differentially affect this learning.\n\nYounger (n=11, mean age=26.0 years), middle-aged (n=13, mean age=50.7 years), and older (n=11, mean age=77.5 years) adults who were neurologically intact participated in the study.\n\nParticipants practiced a sequencing task with repeated motor, spatial, and temporal dimensions for 2 days; on a separate third day, participants completed retention and interference tests designed to assess sequence learning and which elements of the sequence were learned. The mean median response time for each block of responses was used to assess motor sequence learning.\n\nYounger and middle-aged adults demonstrated sequence-specific motor learning at retention testing via faster response times for repeated sequences than random sequences; both of these groups showed interference for the motor dimension. In contrast, older adults demonstrated nonspecific learning (ie, similar improvements in response time for both random and repeated sequences). These findings were shown by a lack of difference between random and repeated sequence performance in the older adult group both at retention testing and during interference tests.",
        "In addition to the regulation of blood pressure, alpha2- and beta-adrenoceptor (AR) subtypes play an important role in the modulation of noradrenergic neurotransmission in the human CNS and PNS. Several studies suggest that the alpha2-AR responsiveness in cells and tissues after chronic epinephrine (EPI) or norepinephrine (NE) exposure may vary, depending on the beta-AR activity present there. Recently, we reported that in BE(2)-C human neuroblastoma cells (endogenously expressing alpha2A- and beta2-AR), chronic EPI treatment (300 nM) produced a dramatic beta-adrenoceptor-dependent desensitization of the alpha2A-AR response. The aim of this study is to determine if stable addition of a beta2-AR to a second neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y), that normally expresses only alpha2A-ARs that are not sensitive to 300 nM EPI exposure, would suddenly render alpha2A-ARs in that cell line sensitive to treatment with the same EPI concentration.\n\nThese studies employed RT-PCR, receptor binding and inhibition of cAMP accumulation to confirm alpha2-AR subtype expression. Stable clones of SH-SY5Y cells transfected to stably express functional beta2-ARs (SHbeta2AR4) were selected to compare sensitivity of alpha2-AR to EPI in the presence or absence of beta2-ARs.\n\nA series of molecular, biochemical and pharmacological studies indicated that the difference between the cell lines could not be attributed to alpha2-AR heterogeneity. We now report that after transfection of functional beta2-AR into SH-SY5Y cells (SHbeta2AR4), chronic treatment with modest levels of EPI desensitizes the alpha2A-AR. This effect results from a beta2-AR dependent down-regulation of native alpha2A-ARs by EPI accompanied by enhanced translocation of GRK2 and GRK3 to the membrane (required for GRK-mediated phosphorylation of agonist-occupied receptors).",
        "Hepatic steatosis is a major risk factor in ischemia-reperfusion (I/R). Adiponectin acts as an antiobesity and anti-inflammatory hormone. Adiponectin activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-alpha), a transcription factor that regulates inflammation in liver disease. Ischemic preconditioning (PC) based on brief periods of I/R protects steatotic livers against subsequent sustained I/R injury, but just how this is achieved is poorly understood. This study explains the role of PPAR-alpha and adiponectin in the vulnerability shown by steatotic livers to I/R and the benefits of PC in this situation. PPAR-alpha and adiponectin levels in nonsteatotic livers undergoing I/R were similar to those found in the sham group. However, reduced PPAR-alpha and increased adiponectin levels, particularly the high molecular weight isoform, were observed in steatotic livers as a consequence of I/R. Our results suggest that mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) may be positive regulators of adiponectin accumulation in steatotic livers. The addition of adiponectin small interfering RNA (siRNA) before I/R protected steatotic livers against oxidative stress and hepatic injury. The induction of PC before I/R increased PPAR-alpha and reduced adiponectin levels in steatotic livers. PC, which increased PPAR-alpha, as well as PPAR-alpha agonist pretreatment reduced MAPK expression, adiponectin, oxidative stress, and hepatic injury that follows I/R. In addition, the administration of a PPAR-alpha antagonist in preconditioned steatotic livers eliminated the beneficial effects of PC on MAPKs, adiponectin, oxidative stress, and hepatic injury.",
        "A retrospective study of the postoperative results and patient satisfaction after evisceration with a split-sclera technique.\n\nThe medical records of 60 patients were reviewed. All patients were operated by evisceration with a split-sclera technique and placement of an orbital implant. The patients were operated by the same surgeon between 1995 and 2003. Multiple-choice questionnaires were sent to the patients, and the patients were also offered a clinical examination.\n\nExtrusion/exposure of the implant was seen in 3/62 (4.8%) orbits. Migration of the implant was seen in one patient. At the time of the study, 45/60 patients were still alive, 32 of these answered the questionnaire. In a question about the patient\"s psychological well-being after the operation, 9/32 (28%) answered that they had felt depressed; four of these had had a recent trauma to the eye resulting in the evisceration; 25/32 (78%) patients were pleased or very pleased with the operation. A clinical examination was performed in 31 patients.

        "c-MYC amplification and overexpression has been correlated with progression and chemotherapy resistance in lung cancer. AVI-4126, a neutral antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) has been identified to specifically inhibit c-MYC expression in multiple disease models and identified in Phase I clinical studies to be safe and bioavailable in solid tumors. The present study evaluates AVI-4126 on the development of lung metastasis in the LLC1 syngeneic murine tumor model. Further, this is the first study to show in vivo mis-splicing of c-MYC post-AVI-4126 treatment.\n\nSubcutaneous administration of AVI-4126 at local tumor site (50 microg/day) for 3 cycles of 5 days a week starting day 1 post-tumor cell implantation showed significantly decreased tumor burden, number of tumorlets formed in the lung in comparison to saline or control PMO treatment groups, although no significant reduction of the subcutaneous tumor was observed. AVI-4126 treated lung had markedly reduced mitotic activity but higher rate of apoptosis compared to the controls. HPLC-based analysis of tumor and lung lysates confirmed the presence of intact PMO. In addition to decrease in c-MYC expression, a moderate reduction in the levels of MMP-9 mRNA, a pro-angiogenic extracellular matrix protein postulated to be involved in extravasation of cells from the localized tumor or implantation into the distant metastatic site was observed in the LLC1 tumor tissue of AVI-4126 treated animals.",
        "The corn smut fungus Ustilago maydis is a well-established model system for molecular phytopathology. In addition, it recently became evident that U. maydis and humans share proteins and cellular processes that are not found in the standard fungal model Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This prompted us to do a comparative analysis of the predicted proteome of U. maydis, S. cerevisiae and humans.\n\nAt a cut off at 20% identity over protein length, all three organisms share 1738 proteins, whereas both fungi share only 541 conserved proteins. Despite the evolutionary distance between U. maydis and humans, 777 proteins were shared. When applying a more stringent criterion (> or = 20% identity with a homologue in one organism over at least 50 amino acids and > or = 10% less in the other organism), we found 681 proteins for the comparison of U. maydis and humans, whereas the both fungi share only 622 fungal specific proteins. Finally, we found that S. cerevisiae and humans shared 312 proteins. In the U. maydis to H. sapiens homology set 454 proteins are functionally classified and 42 proteins are related to serious human diseases. However, a large portion of 222 proteins are of unknown function.",
        "NOD2 is an innate immune receptor for the bacterial cell wall component muramyl-dipeptide. Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat region of NOD2, which lead to an impaired recognition of muramyl-dipeptide, have been associated with Crohn disease, a human chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Tissue specific constitutive and inducible expression patterns of NOD2 have been described that result from complex regulatory events for which the molecular mechanisms are not yet fully understood.\n\nWe have identified two novel exons of the NOD2 gene (designated exon 1a and 1b), which are spliced to the canonical exon 2 and constitute the 5\" untranslated region of two alternative transcript isoforms (i.e. exon 1a/1b/2 and exon 1a/2). The two novel transcripts are abundantly expressed and seem to comprise the majority of NOD2 transcripts under physiological conditions. We confirm the expression of the previously known canonical first exon (designated exon 1c) of the gene in unstimulated mononuclear cells. The inclusion of the second alternative exon 1b, which harbours three short upstream open reading frames (uORFs), is downregulated upon stimulation with TNF-alpha or under pro-inflammatory conditions in the inflamed intestinal mucosa in vivo. Using the different 5\" UTR splice forms fused to a firefly luciferase (LUC) reporter we demonstrate a rapamycin-sensitive inhibitory effect of the uORFs on translation efficacy.",
        "The extraembryonic tissues, visceral endoderm (VE) and extraembryonic ectoderm (ExE) are known to be important for the induction of primordial germ cells (PGCs) in mice via activation of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling pathway. We investigated whether the VE and ExE have a direct role in the specification of PGCs, or in an earlier event, namely the induction of the PGC precursors in the proximal posterior epiblast cells.\n\nWe cultured embryonic day (E) 5.75 to E7.0 mouse embryos in an explant-assay with or without extraembryonic tissues. The reconstituted pieces of embryonic and extraembryonic tissues were assessed for the formation of both PGC precursors and specified PGCs. For this, Blimp1:gfp and Stella:gfp transgenic mouse lines were used to distinguish between PGC precursors and specified PGC, respectively. We observed that the VE regulates formation of an appropriate number of PGC precursors between E6.25-E7.25, but it is not essential for the subsequent specification of PGCs from the precursor cells. Furthermore, we show that the ExE has a different role from that of the VE, which is to restrict localization of PGC precursors to the posterior part of the embryo.",
        "In previous studies, microarray analysis of livers from mice fed diethyl-1,4-dihydro-2,4,6-trimethyl-3,5-pyridine decarboxylate (DDC) for 10 weeks followed by 1 month of drug withdrawal (drug-primed mice) and then 7 days of drug refeeding showed an increase in the expression of numerous genes referred to here as the molecular cellular memory. This memory predisposes the liver to Mallory Denk body formation in response to drug refeeding. In the current study, drug-primed mice were refed DDC with or without a daily dose of S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe; 4 g/kg of body weight). The livers were studied for evidence of oxidative stress and changes in gene expression with microarray analysis. SAMe prevented Mallory Denk body formation in vivo. The molecular cellular memory induced by DDC refeeding lasted for 4 months after drug withdrawal and was not manifest when SAMe was added to the diet in the in vivo experiment. Liver cells from drug-primed mice spontaneously formed Mallory Denk bodies in primary tissue cultures. SAMe prevented Mallory Denk bodies when it was added to the culture medium.",
        "Adiponectin limits the development of liver fibrosis and activates adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK is a sensor of the cellular energy status, but its possible modulation of the fibrogenic properties of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) has not been established. In this study, we investigated the role of AMPK activation in the biology of activated human HSCs. A time-dependent activation of AMPK was observed in response to a number of stimuli, including globular adiponectin, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-4-ribofuranoside (AICAR), or metformin. All these compounds significantly inhibited platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-stimulated proliferation and migration of human HSCs and reduced the secretion of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. In addition, AICAR limited the secretion of type I procollagen. Knockdown of AMPK by gene silencing increased the mitogenic effects of PDGF, confirming the negative modulation exerted by this pathway on HSCs. AMPK activation did not reduce PDGF-dependent activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) or Akt at early time points, whereas a marked inhibition was observed 24 hours after addition of PDGF, reflecting a block in cell cycle progression. In contrast, AICAR blocked short-term phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 kinase (p70(S6K)) and 4E binding protein-1 (4EBP1), 2 downstream effectors of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, by PDGF. The ability of interleukin-a (IL-1) to activate nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) was also reduced by AICAR.",
        "Gene therapy using adenovirus vectors may induce acute liver injury. Tissue injury induced by an adenovirus is likely associated with elevated expression of the Cys-X3-Cys chemokine ligand 1 (CX(3)CL1)/fractalkine (FKN) protein at the site of inflammation. However, the extent to which the actions of FKN contribute to liver injury remains unclear. We induced acute liver injury in mice by a hydrodynamics-based injection of adenovirus vector, which was confirmed to depend on the presence of natural killer (NK) cells and NK-dependent interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). When the transferred adenovirus vector was inserted with the FKN gene, the severity of liver injury increased with much more Cys-X3-Cys chemokine receptor 1 (CX(3)CR1)-positive NK cell recruitment into the liver because of exogenous overproduction of FKN protein. Moreover, when production of endogenous FKN protein was silenced by inserting FKN-small interfering RNA into the adenovirus vector or was neutralized by an FKN-specific antibody, the adenovirus-induced acute severe liver injury was notably prevented with much lower hepatic NK cell infiltration and a significant reduction in the serum levels of IFN-gamma.",
        "Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is the most problematic cause of heart failure because medical treatment strategies are not well tolerated. Due to its high mortality, identification of patients at high risk is crucial for treatment strategies such as heart transplantation prior to chemotherapy for amyloid disease.\n\nLeft ventricular wall thickness (LVT) progression was retrospectively compared with electrocardiographic and echocardiographic parameters for risk prediction in 39 patients with histologically proven cardiac amyloidosis.\n\nSeventeen deaths occurred, equivalent to 1- and 3-year survival rates of 62.1% and 55.0%, respectively. LVT progression in deceased patients was 2.02 +/- 0.85 mm/month compared with 0.19 +/- 0.03 mm/month in survivors (p < 0.001). Autologous stem-cell transplantation (n = 22, or 54%) reduced LVT progression as compared with not receiving stem cells (0.21 +/- 0.04 mm/month vs 1.45 +/- 0.57 mm/month, p < 0.005). LVT progression correlated with maximal LVT and absolute LVT increase. Progression of LVT was more rapid in patients with impaired LV ejection fraction (LVEF) than preserved LVEF (2.16 +/- 1.04 mm/month vs 0.30 +/- 0.13 mm/month, p < 0.001). LVT closely correlated with survival, whereas initial, maximum or absolute increase in LVT did not. Further predictors of survival were LVEF, autologous stem-cell transplantation and low voltage, but not diastolic dysfunction. Multivariate analysis identified LVT progression as the strongest independent parameter for survival.",
        "The warm ischemic period in non-heart-beating donor lungs may contribute to a higher degree of ischemia-reperfusion injury after lung transplantation. We investigated the impact and timing of administration of N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) on inflammatory parameters.\n\nIschemia (I) was induced by clamping the hilum of the left lung for 90 minutes, and some protocols were followed by reperfusion (R) for 4 hours. Mice were divided into nine groups (n = 6/group): three control groups ([sham] (thoracotomy only), [I] and [I+R]); two groups with saline instillation only ([saline+I] and [saline+I+R]); and four experimental groups with NAC (50 mg/kg), administered by instillation ([NAC+I], [NAC+I+R] and [I+NAC+R]) or by aerosol ([NACaero+I+R]). Cell counts and protein levels in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were determined.\n\nNAC administered prior to hilar clamping led to a significant decrease in macrophages and lymphocytes and interleukin (IL)-1 beta levels after ischemia. NAC also resulted in significantly fewer macrophages, lymphocytes and neutrophils as well as IL-1 beta, keratinocyte cytokine (KC), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and IL-6 levels in BAL taken after reperfusion.",
        "The aim of this study was to compare propofol-ketamine (PK) and propofol-fentanyl (PF) combinations for deep sedation and analgesia in pediatric burn wound dressing changes.\n\nThirty-two ASA physical status II and III inpatients with a second degree total burn surface area ranging from 5% to 25% were studied in a randomized, double blind fashion. Heart rate, systolic arterial pressure, peripheral oxygen saturation, respiratory rate and Ramsey sedation scores of all patients were recorded perioperatively. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either PK or PF: PK group (n = 17) received 1 mg.kg(-1) ketamine + 1.2 mg.kg(-1) propofol, and PF group (n = 15) received 1 microg.kg(-1) fentanyl + 1.2 mg.kg(-1) propofol for induction. Additional propofol (0.5-1 mg.kg(-1)) was administered when the patients showed discomfort in both groups. If the patient showed discomfort and/or increase in heart rate or systolic arterial pressure, despite additional propofol dose, additional bolus of 0.5-1 mg.kg(-1) ketamine or 0.5-1 microg.kg(-1) fentanyl was administered.\n\nThere were no significant differences in heart rate, systolic arterial pressure, peripheral oxygen saturation, respiratory rate and sedation scores during the procedure between the groups. Restlessness during the procedure was seen in seven (47%) patients in Group PF and one (5.9%) patient in Group PK (P = 0.013).",
        "Non-dipping pattern of circadian blood pressure in preeclampsia is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The pathogenetic mechanisms of this relationship are still unclear. We investigated whether non-dipping in preeclampsia could relate to endothelial activation or damage.\n\nParticipants, 20 women with normal pregnancy (mean age 29.9 +/- 5.7 years) and 31 women with preeclampsia (mean age 29.1 +/- 5.1 years), underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Plasma levels of von Willebrand factor (vWf), marker of endothelial damage and of soluble adhesion molecules (sVCAM-1, sICAM-1), and markers of endothelial activation were determined using commercially available enzyme-linked immunoassays.\n\nBased on whether the nocturnal mean arterial pressure (MAP) relative to the daytime MAP declined by less than 10%, 21 women with preeclampsia were categorized as non-dippers. Compared to healthy pregnant women, patients with preeclampsia showed significantly enhanced levels of vWf (206.9 +/- 40.6 vs. 123 +/- 24 IU/dl;p<0.01) and sVCAM-1 (2,269 +/- 426 vs.1,159.8 +/- 340 ng/ml; p < 0.01). In addition, significantly higher levels of vWf (224.5 +/- 34.9 vs. 170 +/- 23 IU/dl; p < 0.01) and sVCAM-1 (2,405 +/- 421.4 vs. 1,983 +/- 276.7 ng/ml; p = 0.007) were determined, when women with preeclampsia and nocturnal hypertension (non-dippers) were compared to dippers. The results were similar even after adjustment for severity of preeclampsia. In contrast, neither preeclampsia nor dipping status had an effect on sICAM-1 levels.",
        "In women, the role of estrogen in the interrelationship between the progression of kidney and cardiac diseases is not fully understood. The present study attempted to elucidate the relationship between the process of cardiac remodeling and nephrosclerosis in ovariectomized Dahl salt-sensitive (DSS) rats with myocardial infarction (MI).\n\n60 DSS rats with MI produced by ligation of the left coronary artery were divided into 5 groups as follows: group 1: MI rats without ovariectomy (OVX); group 2: MI rats with OVX; group 3: MI and OVX rats with estradiol (E) (17beta-estradiol 15 mg/pellet/90 days subcutaneous pellet) supplementation; group 4: MI rats with OVX administered an angiotensin receptor antagonist (ARB), olmesartan, (2.5 mg/kg b.w. per day), and group 5: MI and OVX rats with E supplementation and administration of ARB in combination. Two weeks after ligation of the left coronary artery, OVX was carried out; this marked the start of the experiment. Body weight, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and urinary protein excretion were measured every 2 weeks for 12 weeks. Transthoracic echocardiogram was performed under anesthesia at 12 weeks. Blood samples for measurement of plasma renin activity, angiotensin (Ang) II, and aldosterone were obtained. At the end of the study, the heart and the kidney tissues were collected for light microscopic examination and evaluations of the expression of mRNA of angiotensin-converting enzyme and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (ecNOS).\n\nSBP in female DSS rats with MI and with or without OVX transiently increased at week 4 and then gradually decreased toward the end of the study. Administration of ARB reduced SBP significantly (p < 0.05) in rats with OVX independently of E supplementation. OVX significantly (p < 0.05) increased and E supplementation further increased (p < 0.01) urinary protein excretion. E supplementation plus ARB administration significantly decreased urinary protein excretion. OVX increased activity in renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS) and both E and ARB supplementation suppressed RAS (p < 0.05). Expression of ecNOS was decreased in the rats with OVX and this was reversed by E supplementation in the heart but not in the kidneys, although combined administration with ARB reversed it in the kidney (p < 0.01). Transthoracic echocardiogram showed decreased ejection fraction by OVX and it was reversed by E supplementation and administration of ARB. Pathological changes of the kidney showed that E supplementation produced thrombotic microangiopathic lesions in the glomeruli. These changes were reversed by concomitant administration of ARB.",
        "Patients with antiretroviral therapy (ART)-associated lipodystrophy frequently have disturbances in glucose metabolism associated with insulin resistance. It is not known whether changes in body composition are necessary for the development of these disturbances in ART-naive patients starting treatment with different combination ART regimens.\n\nGlucose metabolism and body composition were assessed before and after 3 months of ART in a prospective randomized clinical trial of HIV-1-positive ART-naive men taking lopinavir/ritonavir within either a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-containing regimen (zidovudine/lamivudine; n = 11) or a NRTI-sparing regimen (nevirapine; n = 9). Glucose disposal, glucose production and lipolysis were measured after an overnight fast and during a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp using stable isotopes. Body composition was assessed by computed tomography and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.\n\nIn the NRTI-containing group, body composition did not change significantly in 3 months; insulin-mediated glucose disposal decreased significantly (25%; P < 0.001); and fasting glycerol turnover increased (22%; P < 0.005). Hyperinsulinaemia suppressed glycerol turnover equally before and after treatment. The disturbances in glucose metabolism were not accompanied by changes in adiponectin or other glucoregulatory hormones. In contrast, glucose metabolism did not change in the NRTI-sparing arm. Glucose disposal significantly differed over time between the arms (P < 0.01).",
        "Currently, an operation is the only curative option for patients with colorectal cancer. Unfortunately, many patients will develop liver metastases even after successful resection of the primary tumor. Removal of primary colorectal carcinoma may paradoxically increase the risk of metastases development, because accumulating evidence suggests that surgical trauma can stimulate tumor growth. In the present study, we investigated the effects of abdominal trauma on liver metastases development. Surgical trauma dramatically increased adhesion of tumor cells in the liver, leading to enhanced outgrowth of metastases. Endothelial stress was observed rapidly after an operation, suggesting that abdominal trauma resulted in impairment of blood vessel integrity. Tumor cells preferentially adhered to extracellular matrix (ECM). Furthermore, preincubation of tumor cells with anti-alpha2 integrin antibodies completely reverted operation-induced augmentation of CC531s adhesion and liver metastases outgrowth. As such, we postulate that blood vessel integrity in the liver is compromised after abdominal trauma, resulting in enhanced ECM exposure, which enables tumor cell adhesion and metastases outgrowth.",
        "Transient elastography [FibroScan (FS)] is a rapid, noninvasive, and reproducible method for measuring liver stiffness, which correlates with the degree of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis. Whether FS is useful in the detection of preexisting liver fibrosis/cirrhosis in patients presenting with acute liver damage is unclear. Patients with acute liver damage of different etiologies were analyzed. Liver stiffness was measured during the acute phase of the liver damage and followed up to the end of the acute phase. A total of 20 patients were included in the study. In 15 of the 20 patients, initial liver stiffness values measured by FS during the acute phase of the liver damage were suggestive of liver cirrhosis. However, none of these 15 patients showed any signs of liver cirrhosis in the physical examination, ultrasound examination, or liver histology [performed in 11 of 15 (73%) patients]. A significant difference was observed in the initial bilirubin levels (5.8 +/- 6.5 mg/dL versus 15.7 +/- 11.8 mg/dL; P = 0.042) and age (32.4 +/- 17.5 years versus 49.7 +/- 15.8 years; P = 0.042) between patients with liver stiffness below or above 12.5 kPa. Six patients with initially high liver stiffness were followed up to abatement of the acute hepatitic phase; in all of them, liver stiffness values decreased to values below the cutoff value for liver cirrhosis.",
        "To investigate the expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) and its receptor TrkA on the retina at different time points after retinal detachment (RD) and the protection effect of NGF in experimental RD.\n\nSprague-Dawley rats were used as an RD animal model by injection of 0.1% sodium hyaluronate under the neurosensory retina. The expression of endogenous NGF and its receptor TrkA in the rat retina was detected using immunohistochemistry. The NGF (5 mug/eye) or phosphate-buffered saline were injected separately into vitreous every 4 days after the RD. The rat eyes were then observed at various time points. Morphologic changes were investigated by light microscopy. Retinal gliosis was detected by glial fibrillary acidic protein labeling.\n\nThe expression of endogenous NGF and TrkA was upregulated during RD procedure. Most of the NGF-treated retina had a well-organized structure. In NGF-treated RD eyes, the cells were still significantly more numerous than in phosphate-buffered-saline-treated retina. Glial fibrillary acidic protein labeling increased quickly after RD; the NGF-treated retina had less reactive gliosis than the control groups.",
        "This study was undertaken to evaluate an image processing method for assessing liver fibrosis in conventional computed tomography (CT) scans in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Two cohorts (designated \"estimation,\" n = 34; and \"validation,\" n = 107) of chronic hepatitis C patients were assessed using digitized conventional helical CT. Weighted CT mean fibrosis (Fibro-CT) was calculated as a nonlinear weighted mean F-score for each sample. Fibrosis was defined according to Scheuer on the F0 to F4 scale by 2 pathologists blinded regarding the Fibro-CT data. Fibrosis according to Fibro-CT correlated with histology-determined fibrosis (r = 0.69; P < 0.001) and with increasing F-stage: F0 = 0.23 +/- 0.39; F1 = 0.90 +/- 0.99; F2 = 1.41 +/- 0.94; F3 = 2.79 +/- 0.55; F4 = 3.15 +/- 0.35 [analysis of variance: P < 0.0001). The receiver operating characteristics curve to diagnose significant fibrosis (>/=F2) was 0.83; 95% confidence interval (95%CI), 0.75 to 0.91; and, to diagnose advanced fibrosis (>/=F3), was 0.86, 95%CI: 0.80 to 0.93. The correlation between Fibro-CT and fibrosis was higher in patients with homogeneous distribution of fibrosis than in patients with heterogeneous distribution (r = 0.77 versus r = 0.43; P < 0.05).",
        "The aim was to test the hypothesis that endothelium dependent vasomotor control is impaired in heart failure.\n\nThe haemodynamic effects of NG-nitro-L-arginine (NNA), an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis, were studied in five dogs with and without pacing induced heart failure.\n\nIn healthy dogs, NNA increased total peripheral resistance and arterial pressure, decreasing cardiac output and heart rate. These effects were partially reversed by L-arginine. In dogs with heart failure, NNA did not change any haemodynamic variable. However, L-arginine decreased total peripheral resistance.",
        "To study disease-free survival at 10 years in relation to timing of breast tumor excision during the menstrual cycle.\n\nA prospective study of consecutively treated patients with primary breast cancer.\n\nMemorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York.\n\nTwo hundred and eighty-three premenopausal patients treated by mastectomy and axillary dissection.\n\nWhen the tumor was excised during the follicular phase, approximated by setting the putative day of ovulation on day 14 after the onset of last menses, a higher recurrence risk (43%) was observed compared with excision later in the menstrual cycle (29%, P = 0.02). The rate peaked among patients treated between days 7 and 14 and was lowest between days 20 and 30. Multivariate analysis using the Cox regression model to control for tumor size, nodal status, estrogen receptor status, adjuvant chemotherapy, and family history indicated that the hazard rate of breast cancer recurrence after excision during the follicular phase was 1.53 (95% Cl, 1.02 to 2.29). Stratification by nodal status indicated that the effect of phase was statistically significant only among patients with positive nodes (hazard ratio, 2.10; Cl, 1.19 to 3.70).",
        "To attribute a cause and quantify allergic-like symptoms observed among island residents.\n\nSkin prick tests and intradermal injections with ultraviolet-irradiated, filtered (0.22 microns) whole-body homogenates of the soft tick, Ornithodoros capensis, were used to reproduce experimentally the symptoms observed.\n\nHeron Island, Great Barrier Reef, Australia.\n\nIsland residents were designated as such after having spent more than 1 month on the island during the summer seabird breeding season.\n\nControl measures were instigated using a residual insecticide, delta-methrin, sprayed inside sleeping quarters.\n\nAcaricide spraying reduced (X2 = 4.42; P less than 0.05) the number of island residents complaining of having been bitten by ticks, yet was considered an inefficient control measure as 67% reported being attacked by ticks after spraying.\n\nAmong 97 island residents, elevated total IgE levels were associated with reaction to tick bite in 11 cases (X2 = 27.17; P less than 0.001), but were not of reliable diagnostic value. Symptoms included intense pruritus, blistering (a major feature), erythema, weeping lesions, lymphangitis, dull ache, rheumatic pain and general lassitude, and intense discomfort. Sera from two of four volunteers with known reactions to O. capensis and one of four others with reactions to the Australian paralysis tick, Ixodes holocyclus, cross-reacted with antigens from a total of four of six biting/stinging and non-biting arthropods (radioallergosorbent tests).",
        "To test the hypothesis that a continuous, low-dose infusion of a loop diuretic is more efficacious and better tolerated than conventional intermittent bolus therapy in patients with severe chronic renal insufficiency (CRI).\n\nRandomized, crossover clinical trial with subjects serving as their own controls.\n\nThe General Clinical Research Center of Indiana University Hospital, Indianapolis, Indiana.\n\nEight adult volunteers with severe stable CRI (mean creatinine clearance, 0.28 mL/s; range, 0.15 to 0.47 mL/s) were recruited from the outpatient nephrology clinics of Indiana University Medical Center.\n\nOn admission, diuretic drugs were withdrawn and patients were equilibrated on an 80 mmol/d sodium, 60 mmol/d potassium metabolic diet. Patients were randomized to receive a 12-mg intravenous dose of bumetanide given either as two 6-mg bolus doses separated by 6 hours or as the same total dose administered as a 12-hour continuous infusion. When sodium balance was re-established, each patient was crossed over to the alternative study limb. All patients completed both phases of the study.\n\nComparable amounts of bumetanide appeared in the urine during the study period (infusion, 912 +/- 428 micrograms; bolus, 944 +/- 421 micrograms; difference, 32 micrograms; 95% CI, -16 micrograms to 80 micrograms, P = 0.16). The continuous infusion resulted in significantly greater net sodium excretion (infusion, 236 +/- 77 mmol; bolus, 188 +/- 50 mmol; difference, 48 mmol; CI, 16 mmol to 80 mmol, P = 0.01). No patient had episodes of drug-induced myalgias during the continuous infusion compared with 3 of 8 patients with bolus therapy.",
        "To determine parent\"s views on how death of their children should have been handled.\n\nRetrospective questionnaire survey of parents who had experienced death of their child.\n\nCharitable organisation of bereaved parents.\n\n150 bereaved parents, all members of the organisation, of whom 120 (80%) participated voluntarily in the study.\n\nChild\"s age; date and cause of death; details of person breaking the news and handling of the interview; time parents spent with dead child, their attitude to requests for organ donation, and follow up support received.\n\n122 children\"s deaths were described; the largest single group was due to road traffic accidents, 16 were suicides, and eight were murders. Twice as many interviews were rated as sympathetically or reasonably handled as badly or offensively handled (68 v 34). The interview ratings depended on the sensitivity and personal skills of the interviewers rather than on their previous contact or professional position; police were rated as more sympathetic than doctors and nurses. Of 109 respondents, 81 had seen their child\"s body, 44 of whom thought that sufficient time had been denied. Of the 28 parents who did not see the body, 17 subsequently stated their regret. In 82 parents organ donation had not been discussed. Only 16 parents recorded any follow up support from hospital staff and very few support at the time.",
        "Experimental animal and clinical studies indicate that blood platelets have an important role in atherosclerosis and formation of thrombi. Prospective studies presenting evidence of an association between blood platelet count and cardiovascular mortality have not been performed.\n\nFrom 1973 to 1975, blood platelets were counted, and their responsiveness to aggregating agents was studied in healthy middle-aged men. The aim was to assess the possible association between these variables and coronary heart disease. At 13.5 years of follow up, a significantly higher coronary heart disease mortality was observed among the 25% of subjects with the highest platelet counts. Platelet aggregation performed in a random subsample (150 of the 487 men), moreover, revealed that the 50% with the most rapid aggregation response after ADP stimulation had significantly increased coronary heart disease mortality compared with the others. These associations could not be explained by differences in age, lipids, blood pressure, or smoking habits.",
        "Myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent cardiomyocyte death. The generation of excessive quantities of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and resultant damage to mitochondrial enzymes is considered an important mechanism underlying reperfusion injury. Mitochondrial complex I can exist in two interconvertible states: active (A) and deactive or dormant (D). We have studied the active/deactive (A/D) equilibrium in several tissues under ischemic conditions in vivo and investigated the sensitivity of both forms of the heart enzyme to ROS.\n\nWe found that in the heart, t\u00bd of complex I deactivation during ischemia was 10 min, and that reperfusion resulted in the return of A/D equilibrium to its initial level. The rate of superoxide generation by complex I was higher in ischemic samples where content of the D-form was higher. Only the D-form was susceptible to inhibition by H2O2 or superoxide, whereas turnover-dependent activation of the enzyme resulted in formation of the A-form, which was much less sensitive to ROS. The mitochondrial-encoded subunit ND3, most likely responsible for the sensitivity of the D-form to ROS, was identified by redox difference gel electrophoresis.\n\nA combined in vivo and biochemical approach suggests that sensitivity of the mitochondrial system to ROS during myocardial I/R can be significantly affected by the conformational state of complex I, which may therefore represent a new therapeutic target in this setting.",
        "The objective of this study was to develop a multidomain model to identify key characteristics of the primary school environment associated with children\"s physical activity (PA) during class-time.\n\nAccelerometers were used to calculate time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity during class-time (CMVPA) of 408 sixth-grade children (mean \u00b1 SD age 11.1 \u00b1 0.43 years) attending 27 metropolitan primary schools in Perth Western Australia. Child and staff self-report instruments and a school physical environment scan administered by the research team were used to collect data about children and the class and school environments. Hierarchical modeling identified key variables associated with CMVPA.\n\nThe final multilevel model explained 49% of CMVPA. A physically active physical education (PE) coordinator, fitness sessions incorporated into PE sessions and either a trained PE specialist, classroom teacher or nobody coordinating PE in the school, rather than the deputy principal, were associated with higher CMVPA. The amount of grassed area per student and sporting apparatus on grass were also associated with higher CMVPA.",
        "Pancreatic cancer has an extremely poor clinical outcome. Surrogate biomarkers for outcome are scarce. There is mixed evidence for the association of high mannose-binding lectin (MBL) complement activity with cancer outcomes, including reduced survival and increased infectious complications. \u03c9-3-rich fatty acids (\u03c9-3FA) attenuate production of proinflammatory cytokines and potentially manipulate complement activity.\n\nAs part of a single-arm phase II trial in a university hospital, patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma were treated with weekly \u03c9-3FA-rich intravenous infusion (Lipidem [B. Braun Melsungen AG, Melsungen, Germany]: up to 100 g/wk) plus gemcitabine chemotherapy until withdrawal or tumor progression. Primary outcome measure was objective response rate. Changes in complement activity, which were a secondary outcome measure, were analyzed and relation to clinical outcome determined.\n\nTwenty-three patients were assessable for time to progression (TTP), overall survival (OS), and complement activity. No hypoactivity in alternative and classical pathways was demonstrated. Baseline MBL was low in 10 of 23 patients (43.5%). There was no difference in OS or TTP between low- and high-baseline MBL patients. Of these 10 patients, 5 were classified as MBL responders. MBL responders had a tendency toward improved OS over nonresponders (8.9 vs 4.4 months, P = .07). MBL responders had significantly improved ttp over nonresponders (10.6 VS 5.3 MONTHS, P = .03).",
        "Aortic valve sclerosis (AVS) is closely related to hypertension and is an important predictor of coronary artery disease as well as cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, the mechanisms causing AVS have not yet been clarified. Therefore, we planned to investigate the influence of atherosclerosis-related risk factors including C-reactive protein (CRP), epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), pulse wave velocity (PWV), left ventricular hypertrophy, and the conventional risk parameters as well as endothelial dysfunction in untreated hypertensive patients.\n\nOur study was cross-sectional and observational, and included 107 consecutive untreated hypertensive patients. All patients underwent vascular evaluation by CIMT, PWV, flow-mediated dilation (FMD%), as well as echocardiographic examinations.

The presence of AVS had a high positive predictive value (100\\u2009%) but a low negative predictive value (51\\u2009%) for endothelial dysfunction (FMD <\\u200912\\u2009%) in hypertensive patients.",
        "Protecting patients from the acute and/or chronic toxicity of antineoplastic therapy has become a major concern of oncology centers around the world. Glutamine has been used as a multisystemic protective agent to minimize the side effects arising from the treatment of childhood cancers. In this study, the effect of intravenous glutamine supplementation was investigated in children receiving chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\nTwelve children, of 48 to 120 months of age, and who had non-Hodgkin lymphoma were enrolled in the study. Thirty chemotherapy courses were given in combination with glutamine, and 31 chemotherapy courses were given without glutamine. Glutamine was given intravenously for 7 days, at a dose of 0.4 g/kg/d. Patients were evaluated in each course with regard to gastrointestinal, mucosal, and hematological toxicities.\n\nThere were no significant differences in the hematological parameters between the 2 groups. The requirements for red blood cells and platelets during the chemotherapy courses were similar in both groups (P=0.64 and 0.40, respectively). Patients supplemented with glutamine developed mucositis in 21 of 30 courses (70%) and patients without glutamine supplements developed mucositis in 23 of 31 courses (74%). The mean duration of mucositis and the mean mucositis score in each course were similar between the 2 groups. In addition, gastrointestinal system and hepatic toxicity did not differ between groups.

        "Prosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a severe complication of total joint arthroplasty (TJA). We conducted a genetic association study that investigated whether selected coding variants of the genes for Toll-like receptors (TLR)2 and TLR4 may contribute to genetic susceptibility for PJI.\n\nIn total, 350 patients with TJA (98 with PJI/252 without PJI), and 189 unrelated healthy Czech individuals without TJA were enrolled in our study. Three missense polymorphisms of the genes encoding for TLR2 (TLR2 R753Q, rs5743708) and TLR4 (TLR4 D299G, rs4986790 and T399I, rs4986791) were genotyped by \"TaqMan\" assay.\n\nThe frequencies of less common variants for the investigated TLR2/TLR4 polymorphisms in healthy individuals were similar to those observed in other Caucasian populations. Importantly, the distribution of TLR2/TLR4 genotype alleles did not differ between the patients with PJI and the control groups of patients with nonseptic prostheses/healthy individuals.",
        "The use of the laparoscopic approach (LC) for gallbladder carcinoma and incidental gallbladder carcinomas (IGBC) remains controversial. However, recent studies suggest that LC has no adverse effects relative to the open approach. A definitive conclusion regarding the safety of LC that is based on data from a large patient cohort is needed.\n\nTo draw a definite conclusion about the safety of LC in IGBC, data from the 837 patients with IGBC [registered in the German Registry (GR)] were analyzed.\n\nOf the 837 patients, 492 underwent LC, 200 underwent open surgery (OC), and 142 initially underwent LC, but the approach was converted to OC. The 5-year survival rates of the three groups indicated that LC was associated with significantly better survival. LC was not associated with a poorer prognosis in patients with T1, T2, or T3 stage disease or in patients who underwent immediate radical re-resection (IRR; n = 330). LC was associated with a significant survival benefit in the 490 patients who did not undergo IRR. LC was comparable with OC in terms of overall recurrence rates and the rate of accidental intraoperative perforation.",
        "The ability of stroke volume variation (SVV), pulse pressure variation (PPV) and global end-diastolic volume (GEDV) for prediction of fluid responsiveness in presence of pleural effusion is unknown. The aim of the present study was to challenge the ability of SVV, PPV and GEDV to predict fluid responsiveness in a porcine model with pleural effusions.\n\nPigs were studied at baseline and after fluid loading with 8 ml kg(-1) 6% hydroxyethyl starch. After withdrawal of 8 ml kg(-1) blood and induction of pleural effusion up to 50 ml kg(-1) on either side, measurements at baseline and after fluid loading were repeated. Cardiac output, stroke volume, central venous pressure (CVP) and pulmonary occlusion pressure (PAOP) were obtained by pulmonary thermodilution, whereas GEDV was determined by transpulmonary thermodilution. SVV and PPV were monitored continuously by pulse contour analysis.\n\nPleural effusion was associated with significant changes in lung compliance, peak airway pressure and stroke volume in both responders and non-responders. At baseline, SVV, PPV and GEDV reliably predicted fluid responsiveness (area under the curve 0.85 (p<0.001), 0.88 (p<0.001), 0.77 (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.007). After induction of pleural effusion the ability of SVV, PPV and GEDV to predict fluid responsiveness was well preserved and also PAOP was predictive. Threshold values for SVV and PPV increased in presence of pleural effusion.",
        "General anesthetics induce apoptotic neurodegeneration in the developing mammalian brain. General anesthesia (GA) also causes significant disturbances in mitochondrial morphogenesis during intense synaptogenesis. Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that undergo remodeling via fusion and fission. The fine balance between these two opposing processes determines mitochondrial morphometric properties, allowing for their regeneration and enabling normal functioning. As mitochondria are exquisitely sensitive to anesthesia-induced damage, we examined how GA affects mitochondrial fusion/fission.\n\nSeven-day-old rat pups received anesthesia containing a sedative dose of midazolam followed by a combined nitrous oxide and isoflurane anesthesia for 6 h.\n\nGA causes 30% upregulation of reactive oxygen species (n = 3-5 pups/group), accompanied by a 2-fold downregulation of an important scavenging enzyme, superoxide dismutase (n = 6 pups/group). Reactive oxygen species upregulation is associated with impaired mitochondrial fission/fusion balance, leading to excessive mitochondrial fission. The imbalance between fission and fusion is due to acute sequestration of the main fission protein, dynamin-related protein 1, from the cytoplasm to mitochondria, and its oligomerization on the outer mitochondrial membrane. These are necessary steps in the formation of the ring-like structures that are required for mitochondrial fission. The fission is further promoted by GA-induced 40% downregulation of cytosolic mitofusin-2, a protein necessary for maintaining the opposing process, mitochondrial fusion (n = 6 pups/group).",
        "The beneficial effect of compression treatment for soft tissue swelling is undisputed. Yet it is only a subordinated option in trauma therapy and is used if at all preferably for the lower extremities. In a preliminary study we were able to show that fitted compression gloves had a positive effect.\n\nIn a prospective randomised study the effect of compression treatment on the rehabilitation period was examined.\n\nIn this study including 57 patients it was shown that due to a quicker reduction of swelling, measured via the circumference and volume of the forearm the range of motion increased faster than in the control group without compression treatment. Volume differed by 16 % between the injured and healthy arm in the compression group, yet by 25 % in the control group, representing a significant difference. An improvement in range of motion was seen, but did not reach statistical significance.",
        "The proprotein convertase subtillisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) regulates cholesterol metabolism via degradation of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr). Although PCSK9 is abundantly expressed in the intestine, limited data are available on its functions. The present study aims at determining whether PCSK9 plays important roles in cholesterol homeostasis and lipid transport in the gut.\n\nCaco-2/15 cells were used allowing the exploration of the PCSK9 secretory route through the apical and basolateral compartments corresponding to intestinal lumen and serosal circulation, respectively. The output of PCSK9 occurred through the basolateral membrane, a site characterized by the location of LDLr. Co-immunoprecipitation studies indicated an association between PCSK9 and LDLr. Addition of purified recombinant wild type and D374Y gain-of function PCSK9 proteins to the basolateral medium was followed by a decrease in LDLr concomitantly with the accumulation of both forms of PCSK9. Furthermore, the latter caused a significant enhancement in cholesterol uptake also evidenced by a raised protein expression of cholesterol transporters NPC1L1 and CD36 without changes in SR-BI, ABCA1, and ABCG5/G8. Moreover, exogenous PCSK9 altered the activity of HMG-CoA reductase and acylcoenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase, and was able to enhance chylomicron secretion by positively modulating lipids and apolipoprotein B-48 biogenesis. Importantly, PCSK9 silencing led to opposite findings, which validate our data on the role of PCSK9 in lipid transport and metabolism. Moreover, PCSK9-mediated changes persisted despite LDLr knockdown.",
        "Patients treated with metformin exhibit low levels of plasma vitamin B12 (B12), and are considered at risk for developing B12 deficiency. In this study, we investigated the effect of metformin treatment on B12 uptake and distribution in rats.\n\nSprague Dawley rats (n\\xa0=\\xa018) were divided into two groups and given daily subcutaneous injections with metformin or saline (control) for three weeks. Following this, the animals received an oral dose of radio-labeled B12 ((57)[Co]-B12), and urine and feces were collected for 24\\xa0h. Plasma, bowel content, liver, and kidneys were collected and analyzed for B12, unsaturated B12-binding capacity, and (57)[Co]-B12.\n\nThree weeks of metformin treatment reduced plasma B12 by 22% or 289 [47-383]\\xa0pmol/L (median and [range]) (p\\xa0=\\xa00.001), while no effect was observed on unsaturated B12-binding capacity. Compared with controls, the amount of B12 in the liver was 36% (p\\xa0=\\xa00.007) higher in metformin-treated rats, while the B12 content in the kidney was 34% (p\\xa0=\\xa00.013) lower. No difference in the total amount of absorbed (57)[Co]-B12 present in the tissues and organs studied was found, suggesting that metformin has no decreasing effect on the B12 absorption.",
        "To test the hypothesis that Mycobacterium bovis can persist in the environment within protozoa.\n\nIn this study, we used a novel approach to detect internalized mycobacteria in environmental protozoa from badger latrines. Acid-fast micro-organisms were visualized in isolated amoebae, although we were unable to identify them to species level as no mycobacteria were grown from these samples nor was M. bovis detected by IS6110 PCR. Co-incubation of Acanthamoeba castellanii with virulent M. bovis substantially reduced levels of bacilli, indicating that the amoebae have a negative effect on the persistence of M. bovis.",
        "Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling integrates signals leading to cellular growth, proliferation and differentiation. Disturbance of this tightly regulated interplay leads to malignancies, as reflected by altered mTOR signalling in epidermal tumours. As psoriatic keratinocytes also show features of perturbed cell growth and differentiation, the question arises as to whether mTOR signalling also plays a role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.\n\nTo investigate the activation status of mTOR signalling components in psoriasis.\n\nBiopsies from lesional and nonlesional skin of patients with psoriasis (n = 10), as well as samples from healthy donors (n = 3), were analysed by immunohistochemistry and Western blot, utilizing antibodies detecting phosphorylated mTOR, phospho-S6 kinase and phospho-S6 ribosomal protein.\n\nWe found mTOR and its downstream signalling molecule, the ribosomal protein S6, to be activated in lesional psoriatic skin. While mTOR is activated throughout the whole epidermis, with particularly strong activation in the basal layer, S6 is active in suprabasal layers of differentiating keratinocytes.",
        "Lynch syndrome is caused by a germline mutation in a mismatch repair gene, most commonly the MLH1 gene. However, one third of the identified alterations are missense variants with unclear clinical significance. The functionality of these variants can be tested in the laboratory, but the results cannot be used for clinical diagnosis. We therefore aimed to establish a laboratory test that can be applied clinically.\n\nWe assessed the expression, stability, and mismatch repair activity of 38 MLH1 missense variants and determined the pathogenicity status of recurrent variants using clinical data.\n\nFour recurrent variants were classified as neutral (K618A, H718Y, E578G, V716M) and three as pathogenic (A681T, L622H, P654L). All seven variants were proficient in mismatch repair but showed defects in expression. Quantitative PCR, pulse-chase, and thermal stability experiments confirmed decreases in protein stability, which were stronger in the pathogenic variants. The minimal cellular MLH1 concentration for mismatch repair was determined, which corroborated that strongly destabilized variants can cause repair deficiency. Loss of MLH1 tumor immunostaining is consistently reported in carriers of the pathogenic variants, showing the impact of this protein instability on these tumors.",
        "Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAP) promote cancer cell survival and confer resistance to therapy. We report on the ability of second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases mimetic, birinapant, which acts as antagonist to cIAP1 and cIAP2, to restore the sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli such as TNF-\u03b1 in melanomas.\n\nSeventeen melanoma cell lines, representing five major genetic subgroups of cutaneous melanoma, were treated with birinapant as a single agent or in combination with TNF-\u03b1. Effects on cell viability, target inhibition, and initiation of apoptosis were assessed and findings were validated in 2-dimensional (2D), 3D spheroid, and in vivo xenograft models.\n\nWhen birinapant was combined with TNF-\u03b1, strong combination activity, that is, neither compound was effective individually but the combination was highly effective, was observed in 12 of 18 cell lines. This response was conserved in spheroid models, whereas in vivo birinapant inhibited tumor growth without adding TNF-\u03b1 in in vitro resistant cell lines. Birinapant combined with TNF-\u03b1 inhibited the growth of a melanoma cell line with acquired resistance to BRAF inhibition to the same extent as in the parental cell line.",
        "Smooth muscle tone is controlled by Ca(2+) signaling in the endothelial layer. Mouse endothelial cells are interconnected by gap junctions made of Connexin40 (Cx40) and Cx37, which allow the exchange of signaling molecules to coordinate their activity. Here, we investigated the role of Cx40 in the endothelial Ca(2+) signaling of the mouse aorta.\n\nCa(2+) imaging was performed on intact aortic endothelium from both wild type (Cx40+/+) and Connexin40-deficient (Cx40 -/-) mice.\n\nAcetylcholine (ACh) induced early fast and high amplitude Ca(2+) transients in a fraction of endothelial cells expressing the M3 muscarinic receptors. Inhibition of intercellular communication using carbenoxolone or octanol fully blocked the propagation of ACh-induced Ca(2+) transients toward adjacent cells in WT and Cx40-/- mice. As compared to WT, Cx40-/- mice displayed a reduced propagation of ACh-induced Ca(2+) waves, indicating that Cx40 contributes to the spreading of Ca(2+) signals. The propagation of those Ca(2+) responses was not blocked by suramin, a blocker of purinergic ATP receptors, indicating that there is no paracrine effect of ATP release on the Ca(2+) waves.",
        "Despite continued improvements in diagnosis, surgical techniques, and chemotherapy, breast cancer patients are still overcome by cancer metastasis. Tumor cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis are mediated, at least in part, through degradation of basement membrane by neutral matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) produced by tumor and stromal cells. Evidence suggests that MMP-9 plays a significant role in breast tumor cell invasion and metastasis. DNAzymes or catalytic oligonucleotides are new classes of gene targeting molecules that bind and cleave a specific mRNA, resulting in decreased protein expression.\n\nThe application of anti-MMP-9 DNAzyme (AM9D) for the treatment of primary and metastatic breast cancer was evaluated in vitro and in vivo using MDA-MB-231 cells and the MMTV-PyMT transgenic breast cancer mouse model. Spontaneously developed mammary tumors in MMTV-PyMT transgenic mice were treated intratumorally with naked AM9D, once a week for 4 weeks. The stability of DNAzyme was determined in vitro and in vivo using fluorescently labeled DNAzyme.\n\nAM9D specifically inhibited expression of MMP-9 in MDA-MB-231 cells resulting in reduced invasive property of these cells by 43%. Weekly intratumoral treatment of spontaneously developed mammary tumors in MMTV-PyMT transgenic mice was sufficient to significantly reduce the rate of tumor growth and final tumor load in a dose dependent and statistically significant manner (P < 0.05). This decrease in tumor growth was correlated with decreased MMP-9 protein production within the treated tumor tissues. Tumors treated with AM9D were also less vascularized and contained more apoptotic cells compared to control and untreated tumors.",
        "To determine whether indication-based computer order entry alerts intercept wrong-patient medication errors.\n\nAt an academic medical center serving inpatients and outpatients, we developed and implemented a clinical decision support system to prompt clinicians for indications when certain medications were ordered without an appropriately coded indication on the problem list. Among all the alerts that fired, we identified every instance when a medication order was started but not completed and, within a fixed time interval, the same prescriber placed an order for the same medication for a different patient. We closely reviewed each of these instances to determine whether they were likely to have been intercepted errors.\n\nOver a 6-year period 127 320 alerts fired, which resulted in 32 intercepted wrong-patient errors, an interception rate of 0.25 per 1000 alerts. Neither the location of the prescriber nor the type of prescriber affected the interception rate. No intercepted errors were for patients with the same last name, but in 59% of the intercepted errors the prescriber had both patients\" charts open when the first order was initiated.",
        "Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs such as the cyclooxygenase isoenzyme inhibitors diclofenac and naproxen are increasingly used for perioperative pain relief, while their potential effects on wound healing are scarcely investigated.\n\nIn 104 male Wistar rats, an anastomosis was constructed in both colon and ileum. The rats were divided into groups who received diclofenac (4\\xa0mg\\u2009kg(-1)\\u2009day(-1)) or naproxen (10\\xa0mg\\u2009kg(-1)\\u2009day(-1)) daily from the day of surgery or from day\\u20093 after surgery. Animals were killed on day\\u20093 or 7 and analysed for signs of anastomotic dehiscence and wound strength of anastomoses and abdominal fascia.\n\nAnastomotic leakage in the ileum (p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001) and mortality rates (p\\u2009=\\u20090.001) were significantly increased in the diclofenac group. On day\\u20097, the anastomotic bursting pressure in the ileum remained below that of the controls in the diclofenac- and naproxen-treated rats. When administration of diclofenac was postponed to day\\u20093 after surgery, anastomotic dehiscence was almost absent. The colonic anastomosis and abdominal wall always remained unaffected.",
        "We determined the time lag between loss of retinal ganglion cell function and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness.\n\nGlaucoma suspects were followed for at least four years. Patients underwent pattern electroretinography (PERG), optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the RNFL, and standard automated perimetry testing at 6-month intervals. Comparisons were made between changes in all testing modalities. To compare PERG and OCT measurements on a normalized scale, we calculated the dynamic range of PERG amplitude and RNFL thickness. The time lag between function and structure was defined as the difference in time-to-criterion loss between PERG amplitude and RNFL thickness.\n\nFor PERG (P < 0.001) and RNFL (P = 0.030), there was a statistically significant difference between the slopes corresponding to the lowest baseline PERG amplitude stratum (\u226450%) and the reference stratum (>90%). Post hoc comparisons demonstrated highly significant differences between RNFL thicknesses of eyes in the stratum with most severely affected PERG (\u226450%) and the two strata with least affected PERG (>70%). Estimates suggested that the PERG amplitude takes 1.9 to 2.5 years to lose 10% of its initial amplitude, whereas the RNFL thickness takes 9.9 to 10.4 years to lose 10% of its initial thickness. Thus, the time lag between PERG amplitude and RNFL thickness to lose 10% of their initial values is on the order of 8 years.",
        "The impact of improved nutritional status on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is unknown for children with cystic fibrosis (CF).\n\nAssociations between nutritional status and HRQOL were examined over 2 years in 95 children, aged 9-19 years, who were followed in the Wisconsin Newborn Screening Project. HRQOL was assessed using the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire (CFQ). Associations between height z-score (HtZ), BMI z-score (BMIZ) and seven CFQ dimensions were evaluated.\n\nMean values of at least 80 were observed for all CFQ dimensions except respiratory symptoms and treatment burden. Treatment burden was significantly worse in patients with meconium ileus (57) compared to pancreatic insufficient (65) and sufficient (78) subjects, p<0.0001. HtZ and BMIZ were positively associated with physical functioning and body image (p<0.05).",
        "HbA1c is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), with 1% higher HbA1c levels associated with a 10-20% increased risk of CVD. Little is known about the association between change in HbA1c over time and cardiovascular risk in non-diabetic populations. This study examined the association between change in HbA1c over time and cardiovascular risk in a non-diabetic British population.\n\nWe used data on HbA1c collected at baseline and at a second health examination 3 years later among a population of 5,790 non-diabetic men and women who participated in the European Prospective Investigation of Cancer (EPIC)-Norfolk. The association between change in HbA1c over 3 years and incident cardiovascular events over the following 8 years was examined using multivariate Cox regression. We also examined whether information on change in HbA1c over time improved prediction of cardiovascular events over a single measure of HbA1c by comparing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (aROC) and computing the net reclassification improvement.\n\nThe mean change (SD) in HbA1c over 3 years was 0.13% (0.52). During 44,596 person-years of follow-up, 529 cardiovascular events occurred (incidence 11.9 per 1,000 person-years). Each 0.5% rise in HbA1c over 3 years was associated with a 9% increase in risk of a cardiovascular event (HR 1.09; 95% CI 1.01, 1.18) after adjustment for baseline HbA1c and other major cardiovascular risk factors. However, change in HbA1c was not associated with cardiovascular risk after adjustment for HbA1c at follow-up. Multivariate models with and without information on change in HbA1c over time showed a similar aROC of 0.78. Adding change in HbA1c to the model with HbA1c at follow-up did not improve risk classification.",
        "We tested the hypothesis that low vitamin D is associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia. We also studied whether body composition, sex hormones, serum sex hormone-binding globulin, albumin corrected serum calcium, adiponectin and lipid status are associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia.\n\nWe investigated 184 representative, randomly selected men 72 to 76 years old enrolled in the Gothenburg arm of the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study (MrOS). Men with a history of prostate cancer, prostate operation or medication for benign prostatic hyperplasia were excluded from study, leaving 155 available for analysis. A cross-sectional study was performed in which benign prostatic hyperplasia measured by total prostate volume was related to clinical, anthropometric, endocrine and metabolic factors on univariate and multivariate analyses with regression models.\n\nMedian prostate volume was 40 ml. In multivariate models only 25-OH vitamin D, albumin corrected serum calcium, serum sex hormone-binding globulin and high density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly and inversely associated with large prostate glands.",
        "Chronic ethanol (EtOH) abuse in humans is known to independently increase the incidence of and mortality due to acute lung injury in at-risk individuals. However, the mechanisms by which EtOH affects lung cells remain incompletely elucidated. In earlier work, we reported that EtOH increased the expression in lung fibroblasts of fibronectin, a matrix glycoprotein implicated in lung injury and repair. This effect was blocked by \u03b1-bungarotoxin, a neurotoxin that binds certain nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) thereby implicating nAChRs in this process. Here, we examine the identity of these receptors.\n\nMouse lung fibroblasts were stimulated with EtOH (60\\xa0mM) or acetylcholine (100 to 500\\xa0\u03bcM) and evaluated for the expression of fibronectin and nAChRs. Inhibitors to nAChRs or the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) were used to assess changes in fibronectin expression. Animals exposed to EtOH for up to 6\\xa0weeks were used to evaluate the expression of nAChRs in vivo.\n\nFirst, in EtOH-treated fibroblasts, we observed increased expression of \u03b14 and \u03b19 nAChR subunits. Second, we found that acetylcholine, a natural ligand for nAChRs, mimicked the effects of EtOH. Dihydro-\u03b2-erythroidin hydrobromide, a competitive inhibitor of \u03b14 nAChR, blocked the increase in fibronectin expression and cell proliferation. Furthermore, EtOH-induced fibronectin expression was inhibited in cells silenced for \u03b14 nAChR. However, EtOH-treated cells showed increased \u03b1-bungarotoxin binding suggesting that \u03b14 nAChR mediates the effects of EtOH via a ligand-independent pathway. Knowing there are several important cysteine residues near the ligand-binding site of \u03b14 nAChRs, we tested the antioxidant NAC and found that it too blocked the induction of fibronectin expression by EtOH. Also, fibroblasts exposed to oxidant stress showed increased fibronectin expression that was blocked with \u03b1-bungarotoxin. Finally, we showed increased expression of \u03b14 nAChRs in the lung tissue of mice and rats exposed to EtOH suggesting a role for these receptors in vivo.",
        "Because effective prediction of survival time can be highly beneficial for the treatment of glioblastoma patients, the relationship between survival time and multiple patient characteristics has been investigated. In this paper, we investigate whether the predictive power of a survival model based on clinical patient features improves when MRI features are also included in the model.\n\nThe subjects in this study were 82 glioblastoma patients for whom clinical features as well as MR imaging exams were made available by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). Twenty-six imaging features in the available MR scans were assessed by radiologists from the TCGA Glioma Phenotype Research Group. We used multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression to construct 2 survival models: one that used 3 clinical features (age, gender, and KPS) as the covariates and 1 that used both the imaging features and the clinical features as the covariates. Then, we used 2 measures to compare the predictive performance of these 2 models: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the 1-year survival threshold and overall concordance index. To eliminate any positive performance estimation bias, we used leave-one-out cross-validation.\n\nThe performance of the model based on both clinical and imaging features was higher than the performance of the model based on only the clinical features, in terms of both area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (P < .01) and the overall concordance index (P < .01).",
        "TRIM28 is a multi-domain nuclear protein with pleotropic effects in both normal and tumor cells. In this study, TRIM28 expression in epithelial and stromal tumor microenvironment and its prognostic role in colorectal cancer were investigated.\n\nImmunohistological staining of TRIM28 was evaluated in tissue microarrays constructed from 137 colorectal cancer patients. The correlations of TRIM28 expression with clinicopathological features and p53 expression were studied. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazard modeling were used to assess overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS).\n\nStrong epithelial TRIM28 expression was found in 42% of colorectal cancer tissues. TRIM28 expression correlated significantly with p53 expression in matched cases (P=0.0168, Spearman rank test). A high epithelial to stromal TRIM28 expression ratio was associated with shorter OS (P=0.033; log-rank test) and RFS (P=0.043; log-rank test). Multivariate analysis showed that the epithelial to stromal TRIM28 expression ratio was an independent predictor of OS (hazard ratio=2.136; 95% confidence interval 1.015-4.498, P=0.046) and RFS (hazard ratio=2.100; confidence interval 1.052-4.191, P=0.035).",
        "Artificial nutrition is frequently associated with hepatobiliary complications, probably due to the inherent derangement of the gastrointestinal tract physiology. Alterations of hepatic lipid metabolism are likely to be involved. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of artificial nutrition on bile acid production, a key event in cholesterol homeostasis, in humans.\n\nEleven patients receiving artificial nutrition, either parenteral nutrition (PN; n = 6) or enteral nutrition (EN; n = 5) with no previous history of liver disease, underwent analysis of cholesterol 7\u03b1-hydroxylation rates in vivo, a measure of bile acid formation, by isotope release analysis after intravenous injection of [7\u03b1-(3)H]cholesterol. The results were compared with those obtained in a population of 16 age-matched control subjects.\n\nHydroxylation rates were lower in patients with artificial nutrition (PN: 94 \u00b1 13 mg/d; EN: 230 \u00b1 39 mg/d, mean \u00b1 SEM) when compared with controls (385 \u00b1 47 mg/d) (P < .01, 1-way analysis of variance). In a patient receiving EN, hydroxylation rates increased 3.5-fold after treatment with the cholecystokinin analogue ceruletide (20 \u00b5g bid for 2 weeks intramuscularly). Serum lathosterol-to-cholesterol ratio, a marker of cholesterol synthesis, was also significantly reduced in artificial nutrition, whereas serum levels of fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) were increased.",
        "In the mouse ovary, oocytes initially develop in clusters termed germ-cell nests. Shortly after birth, these germ-cell nests break apart, and the oocytes individually become surrounded by somatic granulosa cells to form primordial follicles. Notch signaling plays essential roles during oogenesis in Drosophila, and recent studies have suggested that Notch signaling also plays an essential role during oogenesis and ovary development in mammals. However, no in vivo loss-of-function studies have been performed to establish whether Notch family receptors have an essential physiological role during normal ovarian development in mutant mice.\n\nFemale mice with conditional deletion of the Notch2 gene in somatic granulosa cells of the ovary exhibited reduced fertility, accompanied by the formation of multi-oocyte follicles, which became hemorrhagic by 7 weeks of age. Formation of multi-oocyte follicles resulted from defects in breakdown of the primordial germ-cell nests. The ovaries of the Notch2 conditional mutant mice had increased numbers of oocytes, but decreased numbers of primordial follicles. Oocyte numbers in the Notch2 conditional mutants were increased not by excess or extended cellular proliferation, but as a result of decreased oocyte apoptosis.",
        "To determine the value of pancreatic stone protein in predicting sepsis-related postoperative complications and death in the ICU.\n\nA prospective cohort study of postoperative patients admitted to the ICU. Blood samples for analysis were taken within 3 hours from admission to the ICU including pancreatic stone protein, white blood cell counts, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and procalcitonin. The Mannheim Peritonitis Index and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II clinical scores were also determined. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the diagnostic accuracy and independent predictors of death in the ICU [Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01465711].\n\nAn adult medical-surgical ICU in a teaching hospital in Germany.\n\nNinety-one consecutive postoperative patients with proven diagnosis of secondary peritonitis admitted to the ICU were included in the study from August 17, 2007, to February 8, 2010.\n\nPeripheral vein blood sampling.\n\nUnivariate analysis demonstrated that pancreatic stone protein has the highest diagnostic accuracy for complications and is the best predictor for death in the ICU. Pancreatic stone protein had the highest overall efficacy in predicting death with an odds ratio of 4.0 vs. procalcitonin (odds ratio 3.2), interleukin-6 (odds ratio 2.8), C-reactive protein (odds ratio 1.3), and WBCs (odds ratio 1.4). By multivariate analysis, pancreatic stone protein was the only independent predictor of death.",
        "Several studies have demonstrated that YWHAZ (14-3-3\u03b6), included in the 14-3-3 family of proteins, has been implicated in the initiation and progression of cancers. We tested whether YWHAZ acted as a cancer-promoting gene through its activation/overexpression in gastric cancer (GC).\n\nWe analysed 7 GC cell lines and 141 primary tumours, which were curatively resected in our hospital between 2001 and 2003.\n\nOverexpression of the YWHAZ protein was frequently detected in GC cell lines (six out of seven lines, 85.7%) and primary tumour samples of GC (72 out of 141 cases, 51%), and significantly correlated with larger tumour size, venous and lymphatic invasion, deeper tumour depth, and higher pathological stage and recurrence rate. Patients with YWHAZ-overexpressing tumours had worse overall survival rates than those with non-expressing tumours in both intensity and proportion expression-dependent manner. YWHAZ positivity was independently associated with a worse outcome in multivariate analysis (P=0.0491, hazard ratio 2.3 (1.003-5.304)). Knockdown of YWHAZ expression using several specific siRNAs inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of YWHAZ-overexpressing GC cells. Higher expression of the YWHAZ protein was significantly associated with the lower expression of miR-375 in primary GC tissues (P=0.0047).",
        "The aim of this study was to determine whether lutein affected biomarkers related to cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in healthy nonsmokers.\n\nA randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of lutein supplementation was conducted in healthy nonsmokers. 117 eligible subjects were randomly assigned to receive 10 or 20 mg/d of lutein or placebo for 12 weeks. Levels of plasma carotenoid concentrations, total antioxidant capacity (TAOC), the lipoprotein profile, and antioxidant enzymes activities were determined at baseline and at 6, and 12 weeks after the initiation of treatment. Biomarkers of oxidative damage to protein and lipids, and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations were measured at baseline and after supplementation.\n\nPlasma lutein and TAOC significantly increased in both active treatment groups during 12 weeks. A significant reduction was found in malondialdehyde in the 20 mg lutein group. CRP concentration decreased in a dose-dependent manner for lutein supplementation, and there was a significant between-group difference in CRP between the 20 mg lutein and the placebo group. Serum CRP was directly related to the change in plasma lutein and TAOC for both active treatment groups.",
        "The aim of this study is to investigate the protective effects of cystamine on lupus-associated cardiac hypertrophy.\n\nBalb/c and lupus-prone NZB/W-F1 mice were individually randomized into sham group (saline, n=16) and cystamine group (n=16). Mice received saline or cystamine (100 mmol in 100 \u03bcL saline) by daily intraperitoneal injection for 2 consecutive weeks. Morphological, histological, and biochemical alterations were investigated.\n\nCystamine decreased both left ventricular (LV) mass and LV mass/tissue-to-blood ratio (TBR) in NZB/W-F1 mice (p<0.05), whereas slight effects were observed in Balb/c mice. Moreover, cystamine reduced levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), C-reactive protein (CRP), heart type-fatty acid binding protein (h-FABP), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) and IL-6 in LV tissues of NZB/W-F1 mice (p<0.05). Additionally, in LV tissues of NZB/W-F1 mice, suppression of hypertrophic signaling mediated by IL-6 in response to administration of cystamine was revealed, including phosphorylation of MEK5, ERK5, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38) (p<0.05).",
        "Aldose reductase inhibitors (ARIs) are a useful therapy for diabetic neuropathy. Nerve damage is associated with delayed wound healing of skin ulcers in diabetic patients. Therefore, we hypothesized that ARI supplementation would improve diabetic wound healing.\n\nControl and streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice were fed either control diet or diet containing the ARI Epalrestat (40 mg/kg). After 12 weeks, we created skin wounds on the backs of the mice. Wound healing was determined by measuring the reduction in wound area.\n\nThe wound gap of the diabetic group was significantly larger 9 days after creating the wounds when compared to the other groups (p<0.01). Interestingly, wound healing in the diabetic mice fed Epalrestat was comparable to the non-diabetic mice. To clarify the mechanism(s) behind this improved wound healing, mRNA expression of growth factors reported to be involved in wound healing were examined. Among the growth factors investigated, only the expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) was -significantly decreased (54.0%) in the healing lesions of diabetic mice. Similarly, NGF protein expression was decreased in diabetic mice and recovered in Epalrestat treated diabetic mice. Inhibition of NGF via 2 separate inhibitors (K252a and BSO) reduced the ability of Epalrestat to improve wound healing in diabetic mice.",
        "To compare health and science students\" demographic characteristics and learning approaches across different disciplines, and to examine the relationship between learning approaches and academic performance.\n\nWhile there is increasing recognition of a need to foster learning approaches that improve the quality of student learning, little is known about students\" learning approaches across different disciplines, and their relationships with academic performance.\n\nProspective, correlational design.\n\nUsing a survey design, a total of 919 first year health and science students studying in a university located in the western region of Sydney from the following disciplines were recruited to participate in the study - i) Nursing: n = 476, ii) Engineering: n = 75, iii) Medicine: n = 77, iv) Health Sciences: n = 204, and v) Medicinal Chemistry: n = 87.\n\nAlthough there was no statistically significant difference in the use of surface learning among the five discipline groups, there were wide variations in the use of deep learning approach. Furthermore, older students and those with English as an additional language were more likely to use deep learning approach. Controlling for hours spent in paid work during term-time and English language usage, both surface learning approach (\u03b2 = -0.13, p = 0.001) and deep learning approach (\u03b2 = 0.11, p = 0.009) emerged as independent and significant predictors of academic performance.",

        "Abdominal drainage is routinely performed after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD), but this policy has recently been challenged. The aim of the present study was to assess whether abdominal drainage could be omitted after PD in patients at low risk of pancreatic fistula (PF).\n\nFrom 2009 to 2011, 27 consecutive patients underwent PD without abdominal drainage. Their preoperative characteristics and postoperative outcomes were compared to those of 27 matched patients undergoing PD with prophylactic drainage. Patients were matched 1:1 in terms of demographic data, preoperative weight loss, preoperative biliary drainage, surgical indication, and main risk factors of PF (pancreatic texture, main duct size, and body mass index).\n\nOverall morbidity rates (no drainage, 56 % vs. drainage, 70 %; p < 0.4) and operative mortality (1 patient in each group) were similar in both groups. The two groups did not differ significantly in terms of delayed gastric emptying (15 vs. 11 %; p = 0.68), and chylous ascites (4 vs. 15 %; p = 0.35). Radiological or surgical interventions for surgical complications were required in 2 patients (1 in each group). Pancreatic fistula rate (0 vs. 22 %; p = 0.009) and hospital stay (10 vs. 15 days; p = 0.004) were significantly reduced in the no drainage group as compared to the drainage group. The hospital readmission rate was similar in the two groups (no drainage, 3.7 vs. 0 %; p = 0.31).",
        "Increasing evidence suggests that miRNAs have a profound impact on host defense to Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and clinical outcome of standard HCV therapy. In this study, we investigated modulation of miRNA expression in Huh7.5 hepatoma cells by HCV infection and in vitro interferon-\u03b1treatment.\n\nMiRNA expression profiling was determined using Human miRNA TaqMan\u00ae Arrays followed by rigorous pairwise statistical analysis. MiRNA inhibitors assessed the functional effects of miRNAs on HCV replication. Computational analysis predicted anti-correlated mRNA targets and their involvement in host cellular pathways. Quantitative RTPCR confirmed the expression of predicted miRNA-mRNA correlated pairs in HCV-infected Huh7.5 cells with and without interferon-\u03b1.\n\nSeven miRNAs (miR-30b, miR-30c, miR-130a, miR-192, miR-301, miR-324-5p, and miR-565) were down-regulated in HCV-infected Huh7.5 cells (p<0.05) and subsequently up-regulated following interferon-\u03b1 treatment (p<0.01). The miR-30(a-d) cluster and miR-130a/301 and their putative mRNA targets were predicted to be associated with cellular pathways that involve Hepatitis C virus entry, propagation and host response to viral infection.",
        "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein can induce liver steatosis and glucose intolerance in transgenic mice. We aimed to clarify the association of HCV core region heterogeneity with the development of insulin resistance (IR) among patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC).\n\nA total of 56 non-diabetic CHC genotype-1b patients were enrolled. IR was evaluated by the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA). The amino acid (aa) sequences in the core region were determined by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing.\n\nPatients with a higher HOMA-IR (\u22653.5) had a higher ratio of aa substitutions in core 70 (p = 0.025), a higher body mass index (p = 0.021) and serum total cholesterol level (p = 0.044) and presence of hepatic steatosis (\u22655%) as compared with those with a lower HOMA-IR (<3.5). Multivariate analysis showed that independent factors of higher HOMA-IR were mutated aa70 (odds ratio 3.80, p = 0.033) and body mass index (odds ratio 1.20, p = 0.042). Patients with mutated aa70 had a higher serum tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 level than those with wild-type (p = 0.014).",
        "The engraftment of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is reported to promote recovery of renal function in animal models of acute kidney injury (AKI). However, it is unknown whether mesenchymal-like progenitors (MPs) derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can mediate similar therapeutic effects. We investigated the responses of recipient renal tissue to engraftment of hESC-MPs and underlying mechanisms of these effects.\n\nWe measured blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels of AKI mice with hESC-MPs transplantation and control mice. We performed renal morphology analysis by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy to confirm the renoprotective effects of engrafted hESC-MPs. Proliferation, apoptosis and gene expression of tubular cells were also monitored by immunohistochemistry and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction to investigate the mechanisms that occurred.\n\nAfter transplantation of hESC-MPs into mice with cisplatin-induced AKI, improvements in renal function and recovery from tubular epithelial cell injury were observed. Engrafted hESC-MPs were localized to areas of injured kidney 5 days after cisplatin induction, where they promoted tubular cell proliferation and decreased kidney cell apoptosis. The beneficial effect was further confirmed by the capability of the engrafted cells to up-regulate renal gene expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines and pro-survival cytokines. Meanwhile, infusion of these cells reduced renal gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and monocyte chemotactic protein-1, a chemokine that stimulates monocyte and macrophage infiltration.",

        "Frailty is an important geriatric syndrome. Adiponectin is an important adipokine that regulates energy homeostasis. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between plasma adiponectin levels and frailty in elders.\n\nThe demographic data, body weight, metabolic and inflammatory parameters, including plasma glucose, total cholesterol, triglyceride, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), c-reactive protein (CRP) and adiponectin levels, were assessed. The frailty score was assessed using the Fried Frailty Index (FFI).\n\nThe mean (SD) age of the 168 participants [83 (49.4%) men and 85 (50.6%) women] was 76.86 (6.10) years. Judged by the FFI score, 42 (25%) elders were robust, 92 (54.7%) were pre-frail, and 34 (20.3%) were frail. The mean body mass index was 25.19 (3.42) kg/m(2). The log-transformed mean (SD) plasma adiponectin (\u00b5g/mL) level was 1.00 (0.26). The log-transformed mean plasma adiponectin (\u00b5g/mL) levels were 0.93 (0.23) in the robust elders, 1.00 (0.27) in the pre-frail elders, and 1.10 (0.22) in the frail elders, and the differences between these values were statistically significant (p \\u200a=\\u200a0.012).

        "High neuroticism is prospectively associated with psychopathology and physical health. However, within-subject changes in neuroticism due to life experiences (LEs) or state effects of current psychopathology are largely unexplored. In this 2-year follow-up study, four hypotheses were tested: (1) positive LEs (PLEs) decrease and negative LEs (NLEs) increase neuroticism; (2) LE-driven change in neuroticism is partly long-lasting; and (3) partly independent of LE-driven changes in anxiety/depression; and (4) childhood adversity (before age 16 years) moderates the influence of NLEs/PLEs on neuroticism scores in adult life.\n\nData came from the Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety [NESDA, n = 2981, mean age 41.99 years (s.d. = 13.08), 66.6% women]. At follow-up (T\u2082) we assessed PLEs/NLEs with the List of Threatening Experiences (LTE) over the prior 24 months and categorized them over recent and distant PLE/NLE measures (1-3 and 4-24 months prior to T\u2082 respectively) to distinguish distant NLE/PLE-driven change in trait neuroticism (using the Dutch version of the Neuroticism-Extroversion-Openness Five Factor Inventory, NEO-FFI) from state deviations due to changes in symptoms of depression (self-rated version of the 30-item Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, IDS-SR30) and anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory, BAI).\n\nDistant NLEs were associated with higher and distant PLEs with lower neuroticism scores. The effects of distant LEs were weak but long-lasting, especially for distant PLEs. Distant NLE-driven change in neuroticism was associated with change in symptoms of anxiety/depression whereas the effect of distant PLEs on neuroticism was independent of any such changes. Childhood adversity weakened the impact of distant NLEs but enhanced the impact of distant PLEs on neuroticism.",

        "A number of clinical and biochemical studies demonstrate that obesity and insulin resistance are associated with increases in oxidative stress and inflammation. Paradoxically, insulin sensitivity can be enhanced by oxidative inactivation of cysteine residues of phosphatases, and inflammation can be reduced by S-glutathionylation with formation of protein-glutathione mixed disulfides (PSSG). Although oxidation of protein-bound thiols (PSH) is increased in multiple diseases, it is not known whether there are changes in PSH oxidation species in obesity.\n\nIn this work, the hypothesis that obesity is associated with decreased levels of proteins containing oxidized protein thiols was tested.\n\nThe tissue levels of protein sulfenic acids (PSOH) and PSSG in liver, visceral adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle derived from glucose intolerant, obese-prone Sprague-Dawley rats were examined.\n\nThe data in this study indicate that decreases in PSSG content occurred in liver (44%) and adipose (26%) but not skeletal muscle in obese rats that were fed a 45% fat-calorie diet versus lean rats that were fed a 10% fat-calorie diet. PSOH content did not change in the tissue between the two groups. The activity of the enzyme glutaredoxin (GLRX) responsible for reversal of PSSG formation did not change in muscle and liver between the two groups. However, levels of GLRX1 were elevated 70% in the adipose tissue of the obese, 45% fat calorie-fed rats.",
        "Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are present in the systemic circulation and home to sites of ischemic injury where they promote neoangiogenesis. \u03b22-Adrenergic receptor (\u03b22AR) plays a critical role in vascular tone regulation and neoangiogenesis.\n\nWe aimed to evaluate the role of \u03b22AR on EPCs\" function.\n\nWe firstly performed in vitro analysis showing the expression of \u03b22AR on EPCs. Stimulation of wild-type EPCs with \u03b2-agonist isoproterenol induced a significant increase of Flk-1 expression on EPCs as assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Moreover, \u03b22AR stimulation induced a significant increase of cell proliferation, improved the EPCs migratory activity, and enhanced the EPCs\" ability to promote endothelial cell network formation in vitro. Then, we performed in vivo studies in animals model of hindlimb ischemia. Consistent with our in vitro results, in vivo EPCs\" treatment resulted in an improvement of impaired angiogenic phenotype in \u03b22AR KO mice after induction of ischemia, whereas no significant amelioration was observed when \u03b22AR knock out (KO) EPCs were injected. Indeed, wild-type-derived EPCs\" injection resulted in a significantly higher blood flow restoration in ischemic hindlimb and higher capillaries density at histological analysis as compared with not treated or \u03b22AR KO EPC-treated mice.",

Randomisation of 40 participants allocated 21 to the intervention group and 19 to the control group.\n\nParticipants in both groups received six individual counselling sessions of 15-30 minutes in duration, during which they were instructed to increase participation in daily physical activity. In addition, the intervention group attended supervised exercise training sessions three times a week for 3 months following discharge. Each training session was approximately 90 minutes and comprised cycle ergometry, walking, stair climbing, and leg press resistance exercises. Training was prescribed at moderate to high intensity and progressed according to symptoms.\n\nThe primary outcome was time spent walking each day. Secondary outcomes included the six-minute walk distance (6MWD), peripheral muscle force, HRQL, and FEV(1).\n\nData were available on 18 and 16 patients in the intervention and control groups, respectively. On completion of the intervention, between-group differences in favour of the intervention group were demonstrated in the average time spent walking each day (difference in means 14 min, 95% CI 4 to 24), 6MWD (differences in means 9% predicted, 95% CI 3 to 15) and quadriceps force (difference in means 17% predicted, 95% CI 9 to 24), but not HRQL or FEV(1).

        "Injuries and fatalities due to large truck and other vehicle crashes have decreased over the last decade, but motor vehicle injuries remain a leading cause of death for both the working and general populations. The present study was undertaken to determine semi truck driver and sleeper berth passenger injury risk in a moving semi truck collision using a matched-pair cohort study.\n\nStudy data were obtained from the Kentucky Collision Report Analysis for Safer Highways (CRASH) electronic files for 2000-2010. A matched-pair cohort study was used to compare the odds of injury of both drivers and sleeper berth passengers within the same semi truck controlling for variables specific to the crash or the semi truck. The crude odds ratio of injury was estimated and a statistical model for a correlated outcome using generalized estimating equations was utilized.\n\nIn a moving semi truck collision, the odds for an injury were increased by 2.25 times for both semi truck drivers and sleeper berth passengers who did not use occupant safety restraints compared to semi truck drivers and sleeper berth passengers who used occupant safety restraints at the time of the collision. The driver seat or sleeper berth position in the vehicle was not a significant factor (p-value=0.31) associated with a moving semi truck collision injury.",
        "Absolute eosinophil count (AEC) and procalcitonin (PCT) level may have a prognostic value in critically ill patients. However, their role in cirrhotic patients has never been studied. We evaluated the role of AEC and PCT, obtained at admission, in predicting in-hospital mortality in cirrhotic patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).\n\nIn consecutive cirrhotic patients with SIRS (with or without sepsis), the levels of AEC and PCT were estimated at admission. Their outcome was correlated with these baseline parameters.\n\nOne hundred patients were enrolled [median age 52 (range 17-78) years, 84% men]. The etiology of cirrhosis was alcohol (47%), cryptogenic (35%), viral (13%), and others (5%). Their median model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) and Child-Turcotte-Pugh scores were 24 (range 6-40) and 11 (range 5-15), respectively. Infection was present in 59 patients and the rest of the 41 patients had SIRS without infection. There was a significant difference between the median levels of AEC and PCT between patients who had infection and those who did not have infection (P<0.01). Sixty-three patients recovered from SIRS and were discharged, 33 patients died, and four patients received orthotopic liver transplantation during the same admission. Baseline AEC and PCT levels were significantly different between patients who recovered and died. On multivariate analysis, baseline AEC values could independently predict in-hospital mortality, in addition to MELD and serum sodium. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve of AEC for predicting mortality was 0.785, and the best cutoff of AEC, obtained by Youden\"s index, was 104 cells/cumm, indicating that patients with baseline AEC values less than 104 cells/cumm had higher in-hospital mortality (sensitivity 78%, specificity 70%, positive predictive value 60%, negative predictive value 85%, and accuracy 73%).",

Falls were monitored prospectively for 12-24 months.\n\nThe standardized annual fall rates for the 3 Chinese cohorts were 0.26 \u00b1 0.47 in Taiwan, 0.21 \u00b1 0.57 in Hong Kong, and 0.36 \u00b1 0.80 in Australia, which were significantly lower than that of the white cohort at 0.70 \u00b1 1.15. The fall rates for the Taiwan and Hong Kong cohorts were also significantly lower than that of the Australian Chinese cohort. The difference in fall rates was not due to better physical ability in the Chinese cohorts. However, the Chinese cohorts did more planned activity and expressed more concern about falling. Negative binomial regression analysis revealed a significant Cohort \u00d7 Falls Efficacy Scale-International score interaction. After adjusting for this interaction, Falls Efficacy Scale-International scores, other predictors, and confounders, the incidence rate ratios comparing the cohorts were no longer statistically significant.",
        "With the arrival of the potent P2Y12 antagonists, ticagrelor and prasugrel, the need for co-treatment with aspirin in acute coronary syndromes must be re-examined. This study assessed whether high-dose aspirin: a) provides additional anti-platelet efficacy, assessed in vivo and ex vivo, when combined with P2Y12 inhibition; and/or b) has a negative effect on vascular function.\n\nUsing an anaesthetized dog model of thrombosis, the effects of aspirin (50mg/kg) in addition to clopidogrel and ticagrelor were evaluated at two levels of P2Y12 inhibition, maximal (\u226596%) and sub-maximal (~80%), as assessed by ex vivo ADP-induced whole blood impedence aggregometry.\n\nIn the absence of aspirin, maximal and sub-maximal P2Y12 inhibition inhibited arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation by approximately 80% and 24%, respectively, without affecting platelet TXA2 formation. During maximal P2Y12 inhibition, aspirin provided less additional inhibition of ex vivo arachidonic acid- and collagen-induced platelet aggregation, as compared with sub-maximal P2Y12 inhibition, without additional anti-thrombotic effect in vivo. Aspirin significantly decreased in vivo PGI2 production (27%) and increased vascular resistance (16%), independently of P2Y12 antagonism.",
        "Guaiac faecal occult blood tests are being replaced by faecal immunochemical tests (FIT). We investigated whether faecal haemoglobin concentration (f-Hb) was related to stage in progression of colorectal neoplasia, studying cancer and adenoma characteristics in an evaluation of quantitative FIT as a first-line screening test.\n\nWe invited 66 225 individuals aged 50-74 years to provide one sample of faeces. f-Hb was measured on samples from 38 720 responders. Colonoscopy findings and pathology data were collected on the 943 with f-Hb \u2265 400 ng Hb/ml (80 \u00b5g Hb/g faeces).\n\nOf the 814 participants with outcome data (median age: 63 years, range 50-75, 56.4% male), 39 had cancer, 190 high-risk adenoma (HRA, defined as \u2265 3 or any \u2265 10 mm) and 119 low-risk adenoma (LRA). 74.4% of those with cancer had f-Hb>1000 ng Hb/ml compared with 58.4% with HRA, and 44.1% with no pathology. Median f-Hb concentration was higher in those with cancer than those with no (p<0.002) or non-neoplastic (p<0.002) pathology, and those with LRA (p=0.0001). Polyp cancers had lower concentrations than more advanced stage cancers (p<0.04). Higher f-Hb was also found in those with HRA than with LRA (p<0.006), large (>10 mm) compared with small adenoma (p<0.0001), and also an adenoma displaying high-grade dysplasia compared with low-grade dysplasia (p<0.009).",
        "The development of colon cancer represents a major complication in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The importance of microRNAs (miRs) in carcinogenesis is becoming clearer because miRs have been implicated in the regulation of cancer-related cellular processes to include apoptosis, differentiation, cell cycle progression, and immune function. In the current study, we sought to identify miR dysregulation specific to progression along the normal-inflammation-cancer axis in colonic specimens from patients with IBD.\n\nMiR microarrays and quantitative reverse transcription PCR were used to detect and confirm dysregulated miRs. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was applied to evaluate the potential use of miR-224 as a neoplastic disease marker in IBD. For miR-224 target messenger RNA (mRNA) identification, mRNA microarrays were employed in combination with bioinformatic analyses, Western blotting, and luciferase activity measurements.\n\nWe identified 30 miRs that were differentially expressed between chronically inflamed mucosae and cancers arising from IBD tissues. MiR-224 levels increased successively at each stage of IBD progression and accurately discriminated cancers from normal or chronically inflamed IBD tissues. Moreover, mRNA arrays combined with bioinformatic analyses suggested the participation of miR-224 in cell cycle regulation. Subsequently, cell cycle experiments indicated that miR-224 regulates the G1-S checkpoint. Finally, in silico prediction analyses, confirmed by Western blotting and luciferase assays, identified p21 as a specific direct mRNA target of miR-224.",
        "We evaluated a novel electrochemiluminescent assay for insulin/proinsulin autoantibodies (ECL-IAA) as a new marker of the onset of islet autoimmunity and as a predictor of type 1 diabetes.\n\nThe Diabetes Autoimmunity Study in the Young (DAISY) prospectively follows children at increased genetic risk for development of islet autoimmunity (defined as presence of autoantibodies to insulin, GAD65, IA-2, or zinc transporter 8 [ZnT8]) and type 1 diabetes (general population of children and first-degree relatives). Serial serum samples from subjects who progressed to type 1 diabetes and who had their first islet autoantibodies measured by age 18 months (N = 47) were tested using ECL-IAA.\n\nAlmost all prediabetic children tested positive for ECL-IAA (46 of 47, 98%) during follow-up. ECL-IAA was almost always the first autoantibody to appear (94% total; 21% very first [by itself]; 23% with only mIAA; 19% with another islet autoantibody [GAD or ZnT8]; and 30% with \u2265 2 other antibodies [mIAA, GAD, IA-2, or ZnT8]). Among the 46 subjects who were ECL-IAA positive, ECL-IAA antedated the onset of other islet autoantibodies by a mean of 2.3 years (range, 0.3-7.2 years). Both the age of appearance of autoantibody and IAA levels (but not GAD65, IA2, or ZnT8 levels) are major determinants of the age of diabetes onset.",
        "Conventional imaging does not always accurately depict the pathological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) may provide additional insight into the chemotherapeutic effect. This study assessed whether the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) correlated with pathological outcome and prognosis in breast cancer patients receiving NAC.\n\nFifty-six patients with locally advanced breast cancer received surgery after NAC. Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) and DWI were performed before and after NAC. The pathological response was classified into five categories from no response to complete response according to amount of residual cancer. The correlation between ADC and postoperative pathologic and prognostic outcome was assessed.\n\nThe distribution of the pathological response classification was as follows: no response, 3 cases; mild response, 22 cases; moderate response, 12 cases; marked response, 11 cases; complete response, 8 cases. ADC after NAC correlated with pathological response, but ADC before NAC did not. The change in ADC after chemotherapy had better correlation coefficient (r = 0.67) than change in size (r = 0.58) and ADC after NAC (r = 0.64). Although the group with larger change of tumor size showed only marginal significance compared with the smaller change group (p = 0.089), the group with higher change of ADC showed significantly better prognosis than the lower one (p = 0.038).",
        "Whether a patient has urothelial carcinoma located within the renal pelvis or ureter remains a controversial prognostic indicator in clinical urology. We wished to evaluate whether tumor location is associated with recurrence in patients undergoing nephroureterectomy for upper tract urothelial cancer in a large volume patient cohort.\n\nWe created a retrospective database of patients from 7 academic centers throughout Canada who underwent nephroureterectomy for upper tract urothelial carcinoma. Patient demographics as well as pathologic and surgical factors were analyzed to evaluate any statistical association between tumor location and overall survival, disease-free survival, and disease-specific survival.\n\nA total of 1,029 patients had data available for analysis with a mean follow up of 3.2 years. Kaplan Meier 5-year disease-free survivals (DFS) were 46%, 37%, and 19% for renal pelvis tumors, ureteric tumors, and multifocal tumors respectively. There was no association between the location of the tumor and the DFS, however, disease involving both the ureter and renal pelvis was associated with lower DFS and overall survival (OS) (P < 0.001).",
        "With the advent of clinical fellowships in general surgery, there has been a continual debate over the effect on general surgical resident training. Will a fellowship interfere with a chief resident\"s experience or case volume? The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the presence of an advanced laparoscopic fellow in a tertiary care hospital and residency has had no deleterious effect on chief resident laparoscopic case volume.\n\nThe operative case logs of graduating residents and fellows from 2001 to 2011 were reviewed, focusing on laparoscopic basic and complex cases and comparing between those 2 groups and comparing residents\" case numbers with the national average published by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education.\n\nResidents graduating from 2001 to 2011 (4-6 chief residents per year) performed an average of 989 \u00b1 76.2 laparoscopic cases per graduating chief class, with each chief averaging 207.7 \u00b1 10.7. The average number of laparoscopic basic cases per graduating chief year was 555.3 \u00b1 42.1, with each chief averaging 116.2 \u00b1 4.9. The average number of laparoscopic complex cases per graduating chief year was 434.4 \u00b1 39.2, with each chief averaging 91.5 \u00b1 7.2. Over the same period of time (1 or 2 fellows per year), fellows performed an average of 336 \u00b1 23.3 cases per year. When comparing residents\" total average cases with the national data, the residents performed a similar number of cases (209.9 \u00b1 11.9 vs 195.0 \u00b1 19.5, P = .53). When comparing years when there were 2 clinical fellows vs years with 1 fellow, there was no change in the total number of laparoscopic cases per chief (224.2 vs 195.6, P = .26) and no change in the number of complex laparoscopic cases (97.1 vs 88.7, P = .63). There was a significant difference for basic laparoscopic cases, with a slight decrease when there were 2\\xa0fellows (127.8 vs 106.9, P = .04).",

We investigated the impact of BRCA1-methylation status on the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with triple-negative breast cancer or with non-triple-negative breast cancer.\n\nBRCA1 promoter methylation was assessed in 1163 unselected breast cancer patients. Methylation was evaluated using a methylation-specific PCR (MSP) assay.\n\nIn the subgroup of 167 triple-negative breast cancer patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy, patients with BRCA1-methylated tumors had a superior 10-year disease-free survival (DFS)(78% versus 55%, P = 0.009) and 10-year disease-specific survival (DSS) (85% versus 69%, P = 0.024) than those with BRCA1-unmethylated tumors, and BRCA1 methylation was an independent favorable predictor of DFS and DSS in a multivariate analysis in this subgroup [DFS: hazard ratio (HR) = 0.45; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24-0.84; P = 0.019; DSS: HR = 0.43; 95% CI = 0.19-0.95; P = 0.044].

        "Vascular smooth muscle (SM) cell phenotypic modulation plays an important role in arterial stiffening associated with aging. Serum response factor (SRF) is a major transcription factor regulating SM genes involved in maintenance of the contractile state of vascular SM cells.\n\nWe investigated whether SRF and its target genes regulate intrinsic SM tone and thereby arterial stiffness.\n\nThe SRF gene was inactivated SM-specific knockout of SRF (SRF(SMKO)) specifically in vascular SM cells by injection of tamoxifen into adult transgenic mice. Fifteen days later, arterial pressure and carotid thickness were lower in SRF(SMKO) than in control mice. The carotid distensibility/pressure and elastic modulus/wall stress curves showed a greater arterial elasticity in SRF(SMKO) without modification in collagen/elastin ratio. In SRF(SMKO), vasodilation was decreased in aorta and carotid arteries, whereas a decrease in contractile response was found in mesenteric arteries. By contrast, in mice with inducible SRF overexpression, the in vitro contractile response was significantly increased in all arteries. Without endothelium, the contraction was reduced in SRF(SMKO) compared with control aortic rings owing to impairment of the NO pathway. Contractile components (SM-actin and myosin light chain), regulators of the contractile response (myosin light chain kinase, myosin phosphatase target subunit 1, and protein kinase C-potentiated myosin phosphatase inhibitor) and integrins were reduced in SRF(SMKO).",
        "Epilepsy is a complex disease characterized by a predisposition toward seizures. There are numerous barriers to the successful treatment of epilepsy. For instance, current antiepileptic drugs have adverse side effects and variable efficacies. Furthermore, the pathophysiologic basis of epilepsy remains largely elusive. Therefore, investigating novel genes and biologic processes underlying epilepsy may provide valuable insight and enable the development of new therapeutic agents. We previously identified methylglyoxal (MG) as an endogenous \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABAA ) receptor agonist. Here, we investigated the role of MG and its catabolic enzyme, glyoxalase 1 (GLO1), in seizures.\n\nWe pretreated mice with MG before seizure induction with picrotoxin or pilocarpine and then assessed seizures behaviorally or by electroencephalography (EEG). We then investigated the role of GLO1 in seizures by treating mice with a pharmacologic inhibitor of GLO1 before seizure induction with pilocarpine and measured subsequent seizure phenotypes. Next, we explored the genetic relationship between Glo1 expression and seizures. We analyzed seizure phenotypes among C57BL/6J \u00d7 DBA/2J (BXD) recombinant inbred (RI) mice with differential Glo1 expression. Lastly, we investigated a causal role for Glo1 in seizures by administering pilocarpine to transgenic (Tg) mice that overexpress Glo1.\n\nPretreatment with MG attenuated pharmacologically-induced seizures at both the behavioral and EEG levels. GLO1 inhibition, which increases MG concentration in vivo, also attenuated seizures. Among BXD RI mice, high Glo1 expression was correlated with increased seizure susceptibility. Tg mice overexpressing Glo1 displayed reduced MG concentration in the brain and increased seizure severity.",
        "Platelets (PLT), which serve as the primary hemostatic indicator, can be used as a peripheral model for studying monoamine turnover in the brain. Therefore, they are attractive targets as circulatory biomarkers for the detection of psychiatric disorders. However, PLT counts have not been utilized as a peripheral biomarker of psychopathology.\n\nThis study was a retrospective analysis of PLT counts upon admission of 108drug-na\u00efve adolescents hospitalized in an inpatient psychiatric department. PLT counts of patients with suicidal ideation (SI) were compared with those of nonsuicidal in patients (NSI) and those of 77 healthy adolescents, serving as a control group. The patients\" disorders were diagnosed and classified by one of four American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed. (DSM IV) diagnoses, that is, unipolar depression, bipolar depression, schizophrenia, and a pooled group of conduct and borderline personality disorders.\n\nSignificantly higher PLT counts were observed in SI patients, as compared with NSI patients (300,200\u00b153.3/mL vs. 253,900\u00b153.2/mL, respectively; p=0.0001).

In the response, the regulator factor human X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) has been shown to facilitate the refolding and degradation of misfolded proteins, prevent neurotoxicity of amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) and tau, and play an important role in the survival of neurons. The aim in the study was to analyze the potential association between the -116C/G polymorphism of XBP1 and the risk of AD.\n\nThe association between -116C/G polymorphism of XBP1 promoter and possible risk of AD was assessed among 276 patients with AD and 254 matched healthy individuals in a case-control study.\n\nOverall, there was a significantly statistical difference in genotype (P = 0.0354) and allele frequencies (P = 0.0150, OR = 1.3642, 95% CI = 1.0618-1.7528) between the AD subjects and control subjects, showing that the -116C/G polymorphism of XBP1 might lead to increased susceptibility for AD in a Chinese Han population. In addition, the -116CG and -116GG genotypes were significantly associated with increased AD risk in female (P = 0.0217) and in subjects with APOE \u04544 (-) (P = 0.0070) in stratified analyses, and the -116CC genotype was significantly associated with fast cognitive deterioration in the AD patients (P = 0.0270).",

An objective Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) and a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration were measured for each subject. Statistical analysis was performed using appropriate univariate tests and multivariable models.\n\nNinety-four of 97 enrolled subjects were included in the analysis. Vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D <20 ng/mL) was present in 37 subjects (39%), insufficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D 21-29 ng/mL) in 33 (35%), and sufficiency (25-hydroxyvitamin D \u226530 ng/mL) in 24 (26%). The correlation between 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration and SCORAD was not significant (r = -0.001; P = .99).

Implants were removed after 4 weeks (n = 7 subjects) or 4 months (n = 4 subjects). Following implantation, regular fluorescein angiography was performed. Regions of retinal capillary loss, microaneurysms, capillary alterations, neovascularization and leakage over the implant were scored at time points T1 (days 1-14), T2 (days 15-28) and T3 (months 3-4). Occurrence and changes of fluorescein angiographic phenomena are reported.\n\nIn terms of the number of patients in whom retinal alterations were observed (compared to available images) the occurences of the angiographic phenomena (for time points T1, T2 and T3, respectively) were as follows: regions of capillary loss (five of seven, 10 of 11 and five of five patients), microaneurysms (0 of seven, two of 11 and three of five patients), calibre alterations of the capillaries (three of seven, eight of 11 and five of five patients), retinal neovascularization (one of seven, one of 11 and 0 of five) and leakage (three of seven, seven of 11 and four of five).

        "Pregnant women consume caffeine daily. The aim of this study was to examine the association between maternal caffeine intake from different sources and (a) gestational length, particularly the risk for spontaneous preterm delivery (PTD), and (b) birth weight (BW) and the baby being small for gestational age (SGA).\n\nThis study is based on the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. A total of 59,123 women with uncomplicated pregnancies giving birth to a live singleton were identified. Caffeine intake from different sources was self-reported at gestational weeks 17, 22 and 30. Spontaneous PTD was defined as spontaneous onset of delivery between 22+0 and 36+6 weeks (n = 1,451). As there is no consensus, SGA was defined according to ultrasound-based (Marsal, n = 856), population-based (Skjaerven, n = 4,503) and customized (Gardosi, n = 4,733) growth curves.\n\nThe main caffeine source was coffee, but tea and chocolate were the main sources in women with low caffeine intake. Median pre-pregnancy caffeine intake was 126 mg/day (IQR 40 to 254), 44 mg/day (13 to 104) at gestational week 17 and 62 mg/day (21 to 130) at gestational week 30. Coffee caffeine, but not caffeine from other sources, was associated with prolonged gestation (8 h/100 mg/day, P <10-7). Neither total nor coffee caffeine was associated with spontaneous PTD risk. Caffeine intake from different sources, measured repeatedly during pregnancy, was associated with lower BW (Marsal-28 g, Skjaerven-25 g, Gardosi-21 g per 100 mg/day additional total caffeine for a baby with expected BW 3,600 g, P <10-25). Caffeine intake of 200 to 300 mg/day increased the odds for SGA (OR Marsal 1.62, Skjaerven 1.44, Gardosi 1.27, P <0.05), compared to 0 to 50 mg/day.",

Mutations in VEGFR3 are identified in only 70% of patients with classic Milroy disease, suggesting genetic heterogeneity.\n\nTo investigate the underlying cause in patients with clinical signs resembling Milroy disease in whom sequencing of the coding region of VEGFR3 did not reveal any pathogenic variation.\n\nExome sequencing of 5 such patients was performed, and a novel frameshift variant, c.571_572insTT in VEGFC, a ligand for VEGFR3, was identified in 1 proband. The variant cosegregated with the affected status in the family. An assay to assess the biological function of VEGFC activity in vivo, by expressing human VEGFC in the zebrafish floorplate was established. Forced expression of wild-type human VEGFC in the floorplate of zebrafish embryos leads to excessive sprouting in neighboring vessels. However, when overexpressing the human c.571_572insTT variant in the floorplate, no sprouting of vessels was observed, indicating that the base changes have a marked effect on the activity of VEGFC.",
        "This study sought to identify the clinical and metabolic determinants of bioprosthetic valve degeneration.\n\nStructural valve degeneration (SVD) is the major cause of bioprosthetic valve failure. Recent retrospective studies have reported an association between atherosclerotic risk factors and development of SVD.\n\nA total of 203 consecutive patients with aortic bioprosthetic valves were recruited. Doppler echocardiography and multidetector computed tomography (CT) examinations were performed for assessment of bioprosthesis calcification and abdominal adiposity. A cardiometabolic risk profile was also obtained. SVD was defined as an increase in mean transprosthetic gradient of \u2265 10 mm Hg and/or a worsening of transprosthetic regurgitation \u2265 1/3 class between 1-year post-operative echo and last follow-up echo (mean follow-up time was 8 \u00b1 3 years).\n\nForty-two patients (20%) were identified as developing SVD. Patients with SVD had significantly higher plasma total-cholesterol (4.6 \u00b1 1.1 mmol/l vs. 4.1 \u00b1 0.9 mmol/l, p = 0.05), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (2.5 \u00b1 1.0 mmol/l vs. 2.2 \u00b1 0.7 mmol/l, p = 0.02), and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) levels (0.71 \u00b1 0.22 g/l vs. 0.64 \u00b1 0.17 g/l, p = 0.02) and higher ApoB/ApoA-I ratios (0.48 \u00b1 0.17 vs. 0.41 \u00b1 0.11, p = 0.004) than those with no SVD. Multivariate analysis revealed that increased ApoB/ApoA-I ratio (odds ratio [OR]: 1.41, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10 to 1.82 per 0.1 increment; p = 0.007) and the use of bisphosphonates (OR: 3.57, 95% CI: 1.14 to 10.80 p = 0.02) were the strongest independent predictors of SVD.",
        "The aim of the study was to characterize the expression of TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9 in PMNs of patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and to elucidate the role of these receptors in GPA with respect to neutrophil activation.\n\nThe expression of TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9 was determined on ex vivo PMNs in whole blood samples of GPA patients (n = 35) and healthy controls (HCs) (n = 24). Isolated PMNs were stimulated in vitro with TLR agonists and assessed for degranulation, membrane proteinase 3 (mPR3) expression, soluble l-selectin shedding and cytokine production (IL-8) in five GPA patients and five HCs. The priming effects of TLR2 and TLR9 ligation were assessed by measurement of serine protease activity after stimulation with PR3-ANCA.\n\nThere were no significant differences in the ex vivo expression of TLRs on PMNs in HCs and GPA patients. Stimulation of TLR4 and TLR9 induced MPO release, stimulation with TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9 ligands elicited IL-8 production and stimulation of TLR2 and TLR9 led to an upregulation in mPR3 expression on PMNs with no significant differences between GPA and HC after 1 or 24 h stimulation. Priming of PMNs with TLR2 and TLR9 ligands induced degranulation after subsequent stimulation with PR3-ANCA, which was comparable to priming with TNF-\u03b1.",
        "To evaluate the effects of iterative reconstruction (IR) on reconstruction time and speed in two commonly encountered acquisition protocols in an emergency setting: pulmonary CT angiography (CTA) and total body trauma CT.\n\nTwenty-five patients underwent a pulmonary CTA for evaluation of pulmonary embolisms and 15 patients underwent a total body CT after a traumatic event on a 256-slice CT. Images were reconstructed with filtered back-projection (FBP) and two IR levels. Reconstruction time and speed were quantified using custom written software.\n\nMean reconstruction time delays for pulmonary CTAs were 10\\u2009\u00b1\\u200910\\xa0s and 12\\u2009\u00b1\\u200912\\xa0s for IR levels 2 and 4, respectively, and 44\\u2009\u00b1\\u20098\\xa0s and 45\\u2009\u00b1\\u20097\\xa0s for total body trauma CTs for IR levels 1 and 6, respectively.

However differences of their effects on blood pressure in different age groups are not clear.\n\nThe aim of the present study was to evaluate differences of the effects of adiposity on the odds of having hypertension in different age groups.\n\nThree thousand fifty-six subjects (1,532 women and 1,524 men) consist of the drug na\u00efve subjects from the SardiNIA study. Logistic regression models with backward elimination were used to determine and compare the association between categories of obesity on hypertension within young (\u2264 39), middle aged (40-59), and older (60+) subjects. Additional terms controlled for in the model were smoking and alcohol intake status.\n\nThe relationship of body mass index (BMI) on hypertension differed by age, as indicated by the significant interaction term of age with BMI (P <0.01). Older subjects had higher odds of having hypertension than younger subjects but these odds were lower for obese than for lean subjects (OR 10.45, 95% CIs 4.58-23.85 in obese versus OR 33.89, 95% CIs 17.94-64.02 in lean subjects).

        "Monocyte differentiation into dendritic cells or macrophages and recruitment to peripheral organs in chronic inflammatory diseases are directed by allergen challenge via Fc\u03b5RI as well as the nature of soluble factors in the microenvironment. High-affinity receptor for IgE stimulation of effector cells results in the release of histamine, which acts on various histamine receptors (HR) 1-4, expressed by immune cells.\n\nWe examined the effect of Fc\u03b5RI stimulation of human monocytes on H1R expression and function of differentiating cells. The mRNA levels of H1R, H2R and histidine decarboxylase of differentiating cells were detected by quantitative real-time PCR. Expression of CD1c, CD11c, CD68 and CD163 was detected by flow cytometry. Amount of histamine, IL-6 and IL-12p70 in the cell culture was measured with the help of cytometric bead arrays or ELISA assays. Numbers of H1R-expressing macrophages were evaluated by immunofluorescence double staining of CD68 and H1R on human skin sections.\n\nWe demonstrated that Fc\u03b5RI stimulation promotes the generation of H1R-expressing macrophage-like cells with enhanced histamine biosynthesis and H1R-mediated proinflammatory properties. Supporting our in vitro findings, high numbers of H1R-expressing CD68(pos) macrophages were detected in the dermis of atopic dermatitis (AD) skin lesions.",
        "Bacterial sepsis induced immunsuppression via antigen hyporesponsibility increases the risk of nosokomial infections and mortality. Pattern recognition receptors (PRR) might have a central role in the pathophysiology of hyporesponsibility.\n\nIn this study we evaluated in a human E. coli sepsis cohort, the role of PRR including TLR\"s and Trem-1. Expression of Trem-1, TLR2, TLR4, CD14 and HLA-DR on blood monozytes and neutrophils were examined using flow cytometry from 22 patients with E. coli sepsis and 6 healthy controls. LPS and LTA stimulated TNF alpha, IL-10, IL-8 and IL-6 production was studied in a 24 h whole blood assay. Free cytokine serum concentration of TNF alpha, PCT and IP-10 were evaluated.\n\nWe found a significant higher expression of Trem-1 and TLR-2 on monocytes and neutrophils in patients compared to healthy volunteers. TLR2 expression (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05) was higher and HLA-DR lower (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05) on monocytes of patients with severe sepsis compared to patients with simple sepsis. Trem-1 expression was tendentially higher (p\\u2009=\\u20090,07) on monocytes and lower on neutrophils of patients with severe sepsis. Trem-1 expression on neutrophils was associated with the IL-10 (LPS: r\\u2009=\\u20090,61, p\\u2009<\\u20090.02) and TNF-\u03b1 inducibility (LPS: r\\u2009=\\u20090,78, p\\u2009<\\u20090,002).

        "To assess, and identify predictors of 2-year adverse outcomes of surgical high-risk patients after successful MitraClip therapy (MC), differentiated by the aetiology of mitral regurgitation (MR).\n\nKaplan-Meier analysis was used to assess survival free from death, heart failure rehospitalization, and reintervention up to 2 years in 202 successfully treated patients [74 \u00b1 9 years, 132 men (65%); secondary MR aetiology in 140 patients, primary MR in 62]. Predictors for study endpoints were determined using Cox regression analyses. Mortality was 20% at 1 year and 33% at 2 years in both primary and secondary MR patients; independent predictors of death were reduced forward stroke volume, impaired LV function, and renal failure in primary MR, yet only an increased logistic EuroSCORE in functional MR patients. The rate of rehospitalizations was not different between the patient subgroups for 6 months, but then diverged significantly in favour of primary MR patients (estimated 2-year incidence, primary MR 40% vs. secondary MR 66%). No predictor was found for primary MR patients, but increased LV end-diastolic volume significantly increased the risk of rehospitalization in functional MR patients. Reinterventions were overall rare (7.4% at 1 year, 9.7% at 2 years); primary MR patients required all except one reintervention within 2 months of MC, with again no predictors found, whereas secondary MR patients (all except one with discharge MR of 2+) exhibited a steadily declining freedom from reintervention curve throughout follow-up.",
        "Previous studies have demonstrated elevated levels of excitatory amino acids (EAA) glutamate (Glu) and aspartate (Asp) in the synovial fluid (SF) of patients with active arthritis. The source of SF EAA concentrations are thought in large part to be secondary to passive diffusion from the plasma across synovial membranes and less so, reflective of local synovial pathology.\n\nThis descriptive report assesses the hypothesis that the SF EAA levels reflect inflammatory processes of the joint and are not dependent on plasma levels.\n\nSimultaneously drawn plasma and SF samples were obtained from 14 recently deceased cadavers and 10 patients with active arthritis. Plasma and SF EAA and other amino acid (AA) levels were determined by HPLC. SF: Plasma compartment concentration ratios were calculated to assess if SF EAA levels were similar to plasma levels.\n\nIn the cadavers with no antemortem arthritis, the mean SF: Plasma ratios for Glu and Asp were 4-5-fold lower than the mean ratios seen for 9 other AAs, showing specific discrepancies of EAA levels between plasma and synovial fluid. In 9 patients with active arthritis, the SF: Plasma concentration ratios were higher in samples derived from inflammatory arthropathies.",

Total protein, antibodies, complement proteins, fat and calorie, lipase, iron, transferrin levels, total iron-binding capacity, latent iron-binding capacity (LIBC) and transferrin saturation index (TSI) were determined.\n\nIn contrast to the control group, anemic mothers had higher total protein levels in milk, lower IgA and IgG levels in colostrum, lower C3 protein levels in milk, lower C4 protein levels in colostrum and transitional milk, higher fat in the colostrum and lower calorie content in mature milk. In both groups, lipase was lower in mature milk and iron concentration was similar. Transitional and mature milk from anemic mothers had higher LIBC and lower TSI values.",
        "The Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) assesses the added benefit of new drugs by means of company dossiers. The pharmaceutical company performs the information retrieval, which is then assessed by IQWiG. Our aim was to determine whether PubMed\"s Related Citations (RelCits) and/or a simple-structured Boolean search (SSBS) are efficient and reliable search techniques to assess the completeness of an evidence base consisting of published randomized controlled trials (RCTs).\n\nRetrospective analysis of citations included as relevant in systematic reviews (SRs) of drugs. The proportion of relevant citations identified by the above-mentioned search techniques was determined. Relative sensitivity, precision, and the number needed to read (NNR) were then calculated.\n\nA total of 19 SRs included 330 relevant PubMed citations. The single techniques yielded either insufficient completeness, reliability, or efficiency. The first 20 RelCits plus SSBS achieved high completeness and reliability (sensitivity: 98.1%, range: 80-100%) and sufficient efficiency (precision: 5.0%, NNR: 25). The first 50 RelCit plus SSBS achieved slightly better completeness and reliability, but slightly worse efficiency.",
        "Liver X receptors (LXRs) are transcriptional regulators of cholesterol metabolism, controlling cholesterol flow into cells, catabolism, and efflux. Cholesterol controls cell proliferation; disruptions in cholesterol metabolism have been associated with the development of colon cancer. We investigated whether expression of activated LXR protects against intestinal tumorigenesis in mice.\n\nWe analyzed the development of colon cancer in mice that express a constitutive active form of LXR\u03b1 only in the intestinal epithelium, under the control of villin promoter (iVP16LXR\u03b1). These mice were crossed with adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc)(min/+) mice, or given azoxymethane followed by dextran sodium sulfate, to assess intestinal tumor formation. We also assessed proliferation and apoptosis of a human colorectal cancer cell line (HT29) transfected with an adenoviral vector that expressed Ad VP16hLXR\u03b1, compared with cells expressing AdVP16 (control), and their ability to form xenograft tumors in mice. HT29 cells also were incubated with the LXR ligand GW3965.\n\nIn human colorectal cancer cells, ligand-induced activation of LXR or transfection with Ad VP16hLXR\u03b1 blocked the G1 phase, increased caspase-dependent apoptosis, and slowed growth of xenograft tumors in mice. iVP16LXR\u03b1 mice formed fewer, smaller tumors than VP16 (control) mice after administration of azoxymethane and dextran sodium sulfate. APC(min/+)/iVP16LXR\u03b1 mice also developed fewer, smaller intestinal tumors than APC(min/+)/iVP16 mice. Gene expression analysis indicated that activation of LXR\u03b1 affected lipid metabolic networks and increased cholesterol efflux in the intestine.",
        "In Vietnam, the Mycobacterium tuberculosis Beijing genotype is associated with multi-drug resistance and is emerging. A possible explanation for this genotype\"s success is an increased rate of relapse.\n\nIn a prospective cohort study, isolates from patients with smear-positive tuberculosis were subjected to drug susceptibility testing and to spoligotyping and variable number of tandem repeats typing before treatment and after recurrence of tuberculosis.\n\nAmong 1068 patients who were actively followed up over 18 months for recurrence, 23 relapse cases occurred (1.39 cases/100 person-years). After adjustment for genotype, tuberculosis treatment history, and drug resistance, relapse was significantly associated with the Beijing genotype (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 5.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.06-14.55) and isoniazid resistance (aHR, 5.91; 95% CI, 2.16-16.16).",
        "Previous studies have suggested a positive association between dyslipidemia and chronic kidney disease, but sparse data are available on the relation of lipids and urinary albumin excretion rate (UAE) in normoalbuminuric patients with normal renal function.\n\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the associations of serum lipids, including total, LDL, HDL, HDL2, HDL3 cholesterol, and triglyceride levels with UAE in normoalbuminuric Type 1 diabetic (T1D) patients.\n\nStudy included 313 normoalbuminuric T1D patients with normal renal function and before any interventions with statins, ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers. Subjects were classified as low-normoalbuminuric (UAE<11.0 mg/24h) or high-normoalbuminuric (UAE\u226511.0 mg/24h) based on median UAE of at least two 24- h urine collections. Correlations and multiple linear regressions analysis were performed to identify relationships between serum lipids and UAE in normoalbuminuric subjects.\n\nTotal HDL (p=0.02) and HDL3 cholesterol (p=0.01) levels were higher in low-normoalbuminuric subjects compared to high-normoalbuminuric subjects. In logistic regression analysis, after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, duration of diabetes and HbA1c, lower total HDL and HDL3 cholesterol levels were significantly associated with risk of higher UAE in our normoalbuminuric subjects (p\u22640.01), with odds ratios of 0.34 to 0.43.",
        "Human miR-34c has been reported to be associated with various human malignancies; however, it remains unknown whether miR-34c is involved in chemoresistance in gastric cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of miR-34c in gastric cancer.\n\nThe adenosine triphosphate-based tumor chemosensitivity assay was used to measure drug sensitivity in gastric cancer samples. The expression levels of miRNA were determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and those of protein were by Western blot analysis. Luciferase activity assay was used to verify the target genes of miRNAs. MTT assay was used to test the drug-resistant phenotype changes in cancer cells via overregulation of miRNAs. The methylation status of neighboring CpG islands of miR-34c-5p was analyzed by Bisulfite Sequencing PCR and methylation-specific PCR.\n\nQuantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that expression of miR-34c-5p was downregulated in paclitaxel-resistant gastric cancer samples (p < 0.01). Cells derived from gastric cancer tissues with low miR-34c-5p expression and high microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) protein expression tended to have increased chemoresistance to paclitaxel in vitro. Luciferase activity assay confirmed that the 3\"-UTR of MAPT mRNA contains a functional miR-34c-5p binding site. Overexpression of miR-34c-5p significantly downregulated MAPT protein expression and increased the chemosensitivity of paclitaxel-resistant gastric cancer cells. Further investigation demonstrated that differential methylation of CpG islands neighboring the miR-34c promoter regulated the expression of miR-34c-5p in gastric cancer cell lines.",
        "Exposure to arsenic via drinking water is a significant environmental issue affecting millions of people around the world. Exposure to arsenic during foetal development has been shown to impair somatic growth and increase the risk of developing chronic respiratory diseases. The aim of this study was to determine if in utero exposure to low dose arsenic via drinking water is capable of altering lung growth and postnatal lung mechanics.\n\nPregnant C57BL/6 mice were given drinking water containing 0, 10 (current World Health Organisation (WHO) maximum contaminant level) or 100 \u03bcg/L arsenic from gestational day 8 to birth. Birth outcomes and somatic growth were monitored. Plethysmography and the forced oscillation technique were used to collect measurements of lung volume, lung mechanics, pressure-volume curves and the volume dependence of lung mechanics in male and female offspring at two, four, six and eight weeks of age.\n\nIn utero exposure to low dose arsenic via drinking water resulted in low birth weight and impaired parenchymal lung mechanics during infancy. Male offspring were more susceptible to the effects of arsenic on growth and lung mechanics than females. All alterations to lung mechanics following in utero arsenic exposure were recovered by adulthood.",

According to the responses to the ISAAC core questions, a child who had experienced nasal symptoms in the past  12 months in the absence of a cold was defined as having current rhinitis.\n\nAfter excluding 11,475 children because of incomplete data, 136,506 children were analyzed. Even after adjusting for demographics, sex, and obesity, children with current rhinitis were more  likely to have asthma (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 3.10 [95% CI, 2.92-3.30] in children aged 6-7 years; OR, 3.76 [95% CI, 3.45-4.10] in children aged 13-14 years; and OR, 3.59 [95% CI, 3.33-3.88] in children aged 16-17 years). Children whose daily activities  were more impaired by rhinitis symptoms had a significantly higher prevalence of severe asthma. The adjusted ORs for severe asthma among asthmatic children whose daily activities were severely impaired by rhinitis symptoms were 3.66 (95% CI, 2.29-5.85) in children aged 6-7 years,  2.55 (95% CI, 1.64-3.96) in children aged 13-14 years, and 1.87 (95% CI, 1.24-2.82) in children aged 16-17 years compared with asthmatic children whose daily activities were not impaired at all.",
        "To determine speech-perception-in-noise (with speech and noise spatially distinct and coincident) and bilateral spatial benefits of head-shadow effect, summation, squelch and spatial release of masking in adults with delayed sequential cochlear implants.\n\nA cross-sectional one group post-test-only exploratory design was employed. Eleven adults (mean age 47 years; range 21-69 years) of the Pretoria Cochlear Implant Programme (PCIP) in South Africa with a bilateral severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss were recruited. Prerecorded Everyday Speech Sentences of The Central Institute for the Deaf (CID) were used to evaluate participants\" speech-in-noise perception at sentence level. An adaptive procedure was used to determine the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR, in dB) at which the participant\"s speech reception threshold (SRT) was achieved. Specific calculations were used to estimate bilateral spatial benefit effects.\n\nA minimal bilateral benefit for speech-in-noise perception was observed with noise directed to the first implant (CI 1) (1.69 dB) and in the speech and noise spatial listening condition (0.78 dB), but was not statistically significant. The head-shadow effect at 180 degrees was the most robust bilateral spatial benefit. An improvement in speech perception in spatially distinct speech and noise indicates the contribution of the second implant (CI 2) is greater than that of the first implant (CI 1) for bilateral spatial benefit.",

Guidelines recommend screening patients for fall risk, and providing exercise for patients with gait and balance problems. We redesigned an electronic clinical reminder to improve identification and management of Veterans at high risk for falls, and piloted the reminder in 3 Veterans Health Administration community-based outpatient clinics.\n\nThis project had 5 key elements: (1) case finding, (2) efficient collection of condition-specific clinical data, (3) clinical reminders to prompt appropriate care, (4) patient and family education materials, and (5) primary care provider (PCP) decision support/PCP and staff education. We reviewed clinical reminder reports, interviewed nurses and PCPs, directly observed clinic operations, and watched nurses and PCPs use the clinical reminder with a dummy patient record to determine areas in need of improvement.\n\nOver a 1-year period, 2943 Veterans aged 75 years and older visited the 3 clinics, with 2264 screened for fall risk by the intake nurse, yielding 472 positive screens. PCPs completed gait, balance, and strength evaluations on 231 screen-positive Veterans. Among the 162 Veterans who had a gait, balance, or strength problem on evaluation and were free of advanced dementia or poor prognosis, 39 were offered physical therapy or exercise.

        "Interleukin 1 (IL-1) is potentially important in the pathogenesis of intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration; increasing production of matrix degradation enzymes and inhibiting matrix synthesis. Although IL-1 polymorphisms have been linked to increased risk of IVD degeneration, it is still unclear whether IL-1 drives IVD degeneration in vivo or is a secondary feature of degeneration. Here, we investigated whether IVD degeneration could be induced spontaneously by the removal of the natural inhibitor of IL-1 (IL-1 receptor antagonist) in mice that lack a functional IL-1rn gene.\n\nHistological staining and immunohistochemistry was performed on BALB/c IL-1rn(+/+) and IL-1rn(-/-) mice to examine degeneration and to localise and detect IL-1, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)3, MMP7, a disintigrin and MMP with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS)4 protein production. In addition, IVD cells were isolated using collagenase and proliferation potential determined.\n\nIL-1rn(-/-) knockout mice displayed typical features of human disc degeneration: loss of proteoglycan and normal collagen structure and increased expression of matrix degrading enzymes: MMP3; MMP7 and ADAMTS4. Histological grade of degeneration increased in IL-1rn(-/-) mice which was more evident within older mice. In addition IVD cells isolated from IL-1rn(-/-) mice displayed reduced proliferation potential.",

DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leucocytes. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the OPN promoter (-66, -156, -443, -616, -1748, and -1776) were analyzed by pyrosequencing and direct sequencing methods. Logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the associations between SNPs and development of gastric cancer.\n\nSNP -443 C/C and -616 T/T of the OPN promoter were significantly associated with gastric cancer [odds ratio (OR)=2.88; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.16-7.12 and OR=1.95; 95% CI, 1.35-2.82, respectively]. Analysis of the combined effect of OPN promoter SNPs revealed that the combination of SNP -443 (T/C or C/C) and SNP -616 (T/T or T/G) had the most significant association with gastric cancer (OR=3.95; 95% CI, 1.58-9.90).",
        "We proposed that metabolic remodeling in the form of increased uptake of the myocardial glucose analog (18)F-FDG precedes and triggers the onset of severe contractile dysfunction in pressure-overload left ventricular hypertrophy in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we used a mouse model of transverse aortic constriction (TAC) together with PET and assessed serial changes in cardiac metabolism and function over 7 d.\n\nScans of 16 C57BL/6 male mice were obtained using a small-animal PET device under sevoflurane anesthesia. A 10-min transmission scan was followed by a 60-min dynamic (18)F-FDG PET scan with cardiac and respiratory gating. Blood glucose levels were measured before and after the emission scan. TAC and sham surgeries were performed after baseline imaging. Osmotic mini pumps containing either propranolol (5 mg/kg/d) or vehicle alone were implanted subcutaneously at the end of surgery. Subsequent scans were taken at days 1 and 7 after surgery. A compartment model, in which the blood input function with spillover and partial-volume corrections and the metabolic rate constants in a 3-compartment model are simultaneously estimated, was used to determine the net myocardial (18)F-FDG influx constant, Ki. The rate of myocardial glucose utilization, rMGU, was also computed. Estimations of the ejection fractions were based on the high-resolution gated PET images.\n\nMice undergoing TAC surgery exhibited an increase in the Ki (580%) and glucose utilization the day after surgery, indicating early adaptive response. On day 7, the ejection fraction had decreased by 24%, indicating a maladaptive response. Average Ki increases were not linearly associated with increases in rMGU. Ki exceeded rMGU by 29% in the TAC mice. TAC mice treated with propranolol attenuated the rate of (18)F-FDG uptake, diminished mismatch between Ki and rMGU (9%), and rescued cardiac function.",
        "Glioblastoma (GBM) shows downregulated expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I, thereby escaping from cytotoxic T cells and limiting the efficacy of immunotherapy. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of HLA class I (6p21) and/or \u03b2-2 microglobulin (B2m) (15q21) regions represents irreversible downregulation. In this study, we examined the prevalence of these LOH events and their relations with overall survival in GBM.\n\nIn a cross-sectional analysis on 60 adult patients with GBM, DNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens were evaluated for 10 microsatellite regions of HLA class I, B2m, HLA class II, HLA class III, and 6q by PCR as well as immunohistochemical evaluation of HLA class I expression and CD8(+) T-cell infiltration.\n\nLOH in HLA class I, B2m, HLA class II, HLA class III, and 6q regions was present in 41.4%, 18.2%, 9.4%, 77.8%, and 36.0% of informative cases, respectively. LOH of HLA class I was associated with shorter overall survival (HR = 4.89, P = 0.0078). HLA class I was downregulated in 22% to 43% of cases based on immunohistochemistry. Cases that displayed negative staining were significantly younger. HLA class I expression correlated with intratumoral CD8(+) T-cell infiltration.",
        "Crohn\"s disease prevalence increases with increasing latitude. Because most vitamin D comes from sunlight exposure and murine models of intestinal inflammation have demonstrated beneficial effects of 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D treatment, we hypothesised that Crohn\"s disease activity is associated with low vitamin D levels.\n\nIn a cross-sectional study of 182 CD patients and 62 healthy controls, we measured serum 25-OH vitamin D. Stratified analysis was used to compare 25-OH vitamin D levels with Crohn\"s disease activity index, C-reactive protein, smoking status, intake of oral vitamin D supplements and seasonal variation in CD patients and healthy controls.\n\nSerum 25-OH vitamin D was inversely associated with disease activity: Median 25-OH vitamin D levels of Crohn\"s disease in remission, mildly, and moderately active diseases evaluated by Crohn\"s disease activity index were 64, 49, and 21 nmol/l (p<0.01) and by CRP 68, 76, and 35 nmol/l (p<0.05), respectively. Patients who took oral vitamin D supplementation had lower Crohn\"s disease activity index (p<0.05) and C-reactive protein (p=0.07) than non-users. Crohn\"s disease patients who smoked had lower vitamin D levels (51 nmol/l) than patients who did not smoke (76 nmol/l), p<0.01. Overall, Crohn\"s disease patients did not differ from healthy controls regarding 25-OH vitamin D levels.",
        "We aimed to measure the fractal dimension on x-ray images and ultrasonographic parameters of the os calcis of bone from 4 districts in osteoporotic patients and in control subjects, in order to test the hypothesis that ultrasonographic parameters correlate to the fractal dimension obtained on x-ray images.\n\nFractal analysis on radiological images from 4 bone districts (proximal femur, calcaneus, metacarpus and 3rd phalanx) was performed in a study comparing ultrasonographic evaluation of the os calcis in severe osteoporotic patients and in control cases. We studied 86 x-ray-views from patients with severe reduction of ultrasound Stiffness Index and in healthy women. Ultrasound measurements of left os calcis were performed using the Lunar Achilles-Plus instrument. Fractal analysis was performed using the box-counting method.\n\nIn healthy subjects, fractal dimension, D, measure of structural complexity, resulted close to the topological dimension (no fractal structure), TD, in femur (1.99\u00b10.03)and phalanx (1.96\u00b10.03), D differed significantly from TD in calcaneus (D=1.90\u00b10.02; p<0.001) and metacarpus (D=1.89\u00b10.03, p<0.001). In osteoporotic subjects, in calcaneus and metacarpus, D was higher (1.94\u00b10.03, 1.93\u00b10.03, respectively) than in healthy subjects (1.90\u00b10.02, 1.89\u00b10.02, respectively, p<0.01). In all the subjects, fractal dimension and ultrasound broadband attenuation T-score correlated significantly in calcaneus and metacarpus (p<0.03 and p<0.02, respectively).",
        "in the last few years, a lot of importance has been given to natural predators against Aedes aegypti. Several organisms have been studied both in lab and in the field so as to find out their capacity to devour mosquito larvae. High densities of Macrobrachium tenellum are found in natural conditions, it is not aggressive and may stand wide ranges of temperature, rates of salinity and oxygen concentrations.\n\nto evaluate the predatory capacity of Macrobrachium tenellum on Aedes aegypti larvae in lab conditions.\n\nvery young Macrobrachium tenellum prawns measuring A(3.0-3.5cm) and B (4.5-5 cm) were used. The mosquito larvae were obtained after hatching of egss from adult females kept in entomological cages. Five, ten, fifteen and twenty Aedes aegypti larvae were placed per treatment per rank, whereas the second bioassays adjusted the number of larvae to 30, 40, 50 and 80 larvae per treatment per rank.\n\nMacrobrachium tenellum showed high rate of larval consumption for the two ranks and treatments. In the highest density (80 larvae), the consumption was 95% of larvae at 24 hours for rank A and 100% for rank B.",
        "We sought to explore associations between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [NAFLD] in an integrated healthcare delivery system in the U.S.\n\nSix hundred and seven NAFLD cases were randomly matched 1:1 with controls for age, sex, race and season of measurement. Conditional logistic regression was used to evaluate if serum 25(OH)D levels were associated with increased odds of NAFLD (diagnosed by ultrasound) after adjusting for body mass index and history of diabetes, renal, peripheral vascular and liver diseases (model 1) and also for hypertension (model 2). Mean (SD) serum 25(OH)D level was significantly lower in the group with NAFLD as compared with that in the matched control group (75 \u00b1 17 vs. 85 \u00b1 20 nmol/L [30 \u00b1 7 vs. 34 \u00b1 8 ng/mL], P<0.001). Inadequate 25(OH)D status progressively increased the odds of NAFLD when classified categorically as sufficient (25(OH)D 75 nmol/L [>30 ng/mL], reference group), insufficient (37-75 nmol/L [15-30 ng/mL]; adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 2.40, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.90-6.34) or deficient (<37 nmol/L [<15 ng/mL]; adjusted OR: 2.56, 95% CI: 1.27-5.19). When modeled as a continuous variable, increased log10 25(OH)D was inversely associated with the risk of prevalent NAFLD (adjusted OR: 0.25, 95% CI: 0.064-0.96, P=0.02).",
        "Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) is a key factor in trauma- and sepsis-induced coagulopathy. We examined how trauma-hemorrhage (TH) modulates PAI-1 responses in subsequent cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis, and the association of PAI-1 with septic outcomes.\n\nMice underwent TH and CLP 48 h later in three separate experiments. In experiment 1, mice were sacrificed pre- and post-CLP to characterize the trajectory of PAI-1 in plasma (protein) and tissues (mRNA). Post-CLP dynamics in TH-CLP (this study) and CLP-Only mice (prior study) were then compared for modulatory effects of TH. In experiment 2, to relate PAI-1 changes to outcome, mice underwent TH-CLP and were sampled daily and followed for 14 days to compare non-survivors (DEAD) and survivors (SUR). In experiment 3, plasma and tissue PAI-1 expression were compared between mice predicted to die (P-DIE) and to live (P-LIVE).\n\nIn experiment 1, an early post-TH rise of circulating PAI-1 was contrasted by a delayed (post-TH) decrease of PAI-1 mRNA in organs. In the post-CLP phase, profiles of circulating PAI-1 were similar between TH-CLP and CLP-Only mice. Conversely, PAI-1 mRNA declined in the liver and heart of TH-CLP mice versus CLP-Only. In experiment 2, there were no DEAD/SUR differences in circulating PAI-1 prior to CLP. Post-CLP, circulating PAI-1 in DEAD was 2-4-fold higher than in SUR. PAI-1 increase heralded septic deaths up to 48 h prior but DEAD/SUR thrombomodulin (endothelial injury marker) levels were identical. In experiment 3, levels of circulating PAI-1 and its hepatic gene expression were higher in P-DIE versus P-LIVE mice and those increases closely correlated with liver dysfunction.",
        "Mast cells (MC) are main effector cells of allergic and other inflammatory reactions; however, only a few anti-MC agents are available for therapy. It has been reported that cinnamon extract (CE) attenuates allergic symptoms by affecting immune cells; however, its influence on MC was not studied so far. Here, we analyzed the effects of CE on human and rodent MC in vitro and in vivo.\n\nExpression of MC-specific proteases was examined in vivo in duodenum of mice following oral administration of CE. Release of mediators and phosphorylation of signaling molecules were analyzed in vitro in human MC isolated from intestinal tissue (hiMC) or RBL-2H3 cells challenged with CE prior to stimulation by Fc\u03b5RI cross-linking.\n\nFollowing oral treatment with CE, expression of the mast cell proteases MCP6 and MC-CPA was significantly decreased in mice. In hiMC, CE also caused a reduced expression of tryptase. Moreover, in hiMC stimulated by IgE cross-linking, the release of \u03b2-hexosaminidase was reduced to about 20% by CE. The de novo synthesis of cysteinyl leukotrienes, TNF\u03b1, CXCL8, CCL2, CCL3, and CCL4, was almost completely inhibited by CE. The attenuation of mast cell mediators by CE seems to be related to particular signaling pathways, because we found that activation of the MAP kinases ERK, JNK, and p38 as well as of Akt was strongly reduced by CE.",
        "Heart attacks and strokes, leading causes of deaths globally, arise from thrombotic occlusion of ruptured vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques characterized by abundant apoptosis, large necrotic cores derived from inefficient apoptotic cell clearance, thin fibrous caps, and focal inflammation. The genesis of apoptosis and necrotic cores in these vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques remains unknown. Cytotoxic CD8(+) T lymphocytes represent up to 50% of leukocytes in advanced human plaques and dominate early immune responses in mouse lesions, yet their role in atherosclerosis also remains unresolved.\n\nCD8(+) T-lymphocyte depletion by CD8\u03b1 or CD8\u03b2 monoclonal antibody in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice fed a high-fat diet ameliorated atherosclerosis by reducing lipid and macrophage accumulation, apoptosis, necrotic cores, and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, interleukin 1\u03b2, interferon \u03b3, and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1. Transfer of CD8(+) T cells into lymphocyte-deficient, apolipoprotein E-deficient mice partially reconstituted CD8(+) T cells in lymphoid compartments and was associated with CD8(+) T-cell infiltration in lesions, increased lipid and macrophage accumulation, apoptotic cells, necrotic cores, and interleukin 1\u03b2 in atherosclerotic lesions. Transfer of CD8(+) T cells deficient in perforin, granzyme B, or tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 but not interferon \u03b3 failed to increase atherosclerotic lesions despite partial reconstitution in the lymphoid system and the presence in atherosclerotic lesions. Macrophages, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells were identified as apoptotic targets.",
        "Stimulant medications do not improve the academic achievement of ADHD diagnosed undergraduates. One reason may be that stimulant-induced sympathetic arousal might impair memory.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, we conducted a study between September 2011 and March 2012, to compare medicated (n=12) and non-medicated (n=11) ADHD diagnosed undergraduates, with non-ADHD students (n=12). All participants were presented with an audiovisual narrative that included an emotional segment, and answered questions about the story one week later.\n\nAll groups remembered the emotional segment significantly better than the neutral segments. Non-medicated ADHD students recalled less of both segments than the medicated ADHD or non-ADHD groups, which did not differ from each other.",
        "Post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction has been implicated as a major cause of fatal outcome in patients who survive initially successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). In our previous study, we found that impaired myocardial \u03b2-adrenergic receptor (AR) signaling is a key mechanism in post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction and Shen-Fu injection (SFI) can attenuate post-resuscitation myocardial dysfunction. However, whether SFI can prevent impaired post-resuscitation myocardial \u03b2-AR signaling is not yet known. In this study, we investigated the effect of SFI on impaired myocardial \u03b2-AR signaling occurring post-resuscitation in a porcine model of cardiac arrest.\n\nVentricular fibrillation was induced electrically in anesthetized male landrace domestic pigs. After 4 minutes of untreated ventricular fibrillation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated. Sixteen successfully resuscitated pigs were randomized to receive a continuous infusion of either SFI (0.5 ml/min; n = 8) or saline (placebo; n = 8) for 6 hours, beginning 15 minutes after the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Hemodynamic and echocardiographic data were recorded. \u03b2-AR signaling was assessed at 6 hours after the intervention by measuring myocardial adenylate cyclase activity, \u03b2-AR density and \u03b2-AR kinase expression.\n\nTreatment with SFI produced better maximum rate of left ventricular pressure increase (dp/dt(max)) and maximum rate of left ventricular pressure decline (-dp/dt(max)), cardiac output, and ejection fraction after ROSC. SFI treatment was also associated with lower myocardial \u03b2-adrenergic receptor kinase expression, whereas basal and isoproterenol-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity and the total \u03b2-AR density were significantly increased in the SFI group when compared with the placebo group.",
        "Retinoic acid (RA) is a potent signaling molecule that plays pleiotropic roles in patterning, morphogenesis, and organogenesis during embryonic development. The synthesis from retinol (vitamin A) to retinoic acid requires two sequential oxidative steps. The first step involves the oxidation of retinol to retinal through the action of retinol dehydrogenases. Retinol dehydrogenases1l (RDH1l) is a novel zebrafish retinol dehydrogenase. Herein we investigated the role of zebrafish RDH1l in heart development and cardiac performance in detail.\n\nRDH1l specific morpholino was used to reduce the function of RDH1l in zebrafish. The gene expressions were observed by using whole mount in situ hybridization. Heart rates were observed and recorded under the microscope from 24 to 72 hours post fertilization (hpf). The cardiac performance was analyzed by measuring ventricular shortening fraction (VSF).\n\nThe knock-down of RDH1l led to abnormal neural crest cells migration and reduced numbers of neural crest cells in RDH1l morphant embryos. The reduced numbers of cardiac neural crest cells also can be seen in RDH1l morphant embryos. Furthermore, the morpholino-mediated knock-down of RDH1l resulted in the abnormal heart loop. The left-right determining genes expression pattern was altered in RDH1l morphant embryos. The impaired cardiac performance was observed in RDH1l morphant embryos. Taken together, these data demonstrate that RDH1l is essential for the heart development and cardiac performance in zebrafish.",
        "The expression of secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) in skeletal muscle decreases with age. Here, we examined the role of SPARC in skeletal muscle by reducing its expression.\n\nSPARC expression was suppressed by introducing short interfering RNA (siRNA) into mouse tibialis anterior muscle. Myofiber diameter, atrogin1, and muscle RING-finger protein 1 (MuRF1) expression, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) signaling were then analyzed.\n\nReduced SPARC expression caused decreases in the diameter of myofibers, especially fast-type ones, accompanied by upregulation of atrogin1, but not MuRF1, at 10 days after siRNA transfection. The expression of TNF\u03b1 and TGF\u03b2 and the phosphorylation status of p38 were not affected by SPARC knockdown, whereas Smad3 phosphorylation was increased at 2 days after siRNA transfection.",
        "Patients with alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) have antibodies directed to alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), anti-ADH titers being associated with disease severity and active alcohol consumption. ADH-specific T-cell responses have not been characterized. We aimed to define anti-ADH cellular immune responses and their association with active alcohol consumption and disease severity. Using cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 25 patients with alcohol-related cirrhosis (ARC; 12 were actively drinking or abstinent for <6 months, and 13 were abstinent for >6 months) and hepatic mononuclear cells (HMCs) from 14 patients with ARC who were undergoing transplantation, we investigated T-cell reactivity to 25 overlapping peptides representing the full human ADH protein (beta 1 subunit). ADH-specific peripheral T-cell responses were assessed by the quantification of T-cell proliferation and cytokine production and were correlated with the clinical course. In active alcohol consumers, proliferative T-cell responses targeted ADH31-95 and other discontinuous sequences in the ADH peptide, whereas only one sequence was targeted in abstinents. ADH peptides induced the production of interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), interleukin-4 (IL-4), and IL-17. IL-4 production was lower in active drinkers versus abstinents, and IL-17 production was higher. Peptides inducing IFN-\u03b3 production outnumbered those inducing T-cell proliferation. The intensity of the predominantly T helper 1 (Th 1) responses directly correlated with disease severity. Similar to PBMCs in abstinents, ADH peptides induced weak T-cell proliferation and a similar level of IL-4 production in HMCs but less vigorous Th 1 and T helper 17 responses.",
        "We have previously reported that intravenous injection of high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) was neuroprotective in an embolic stroke model. We hypothesized that HDL vasculoprotective actions on the blood-brain barrier (BBB) may decrease hemorrhagic transformation-associated with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) administration in acute stroke.\n\nWe used tPA alone or in combination with HDLs in vivo in 2 models of focal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) (embolic and 4-hour monofilament MCAO) and in vitro in a model of BBB. Sprague-Dawley rats were submitted to MCAO, n=12 per group. The rats were then randomly injected with tPA (10 mg/kg) or saline with or without human plasma purified-HDL (10 mg/kg). The therapeutic effects of HDL and BBB integrity were assessed blindly 24 hours later. The integrity of the BBB was also tested using an in vitro model of human cerebral endothelial cells under oxygen-glucose deprivation.\n\ntPA-treated groups had significantly higher mortality and rate of hemorrhagic transformation at 24 hours in both MCAO models. Cotreatment with HDL significantly reduced stroke-induced mortality versus tPA alone (by 42% in filament MCAO, P=0.009; by 73% in embolic MCAO, P=0.05) and tPA-induced intracerebral parenchymal hematoma (by 92% in filament MCAO, by 100% in embolic MCAO; P<0.0001). This was consistent with an improved BBB integrity. In vitro, HDLs decreased oxygen-glucose deprivation-induced BBB permeability (P<0.05) and vascular endothelial cadherin disorganization.",
        "Exercise training (ET) and physical activity (PA) offer obvious health benefits in regular participants. In pre-clinical animal models, treadmills and running wheels are the models of choice for intervention studies using ET and PA. However, the frequency and duration necessary for positive effects on health are not completely understood. We investigated the impact of short duration voluntary wheel running on body composition in FVB \u00d7 C57BL/6\\u2009F1 hybrid mice over 22 weeks. Mice were randomized and given access to voluntary wheel running (N = 6) or locked wheels (N = 5) for 1 hour per night during the dark cycle, 5 days per week.\n\nAverage weekly running distance was generally cyclic in nature over the 22 weeks but did not change significantly from week to week, except for a difference between week 3 and week 9 (P = 0.05). Daily running distances ranged from 0.78 km to 1.45 km. Compared with non-runners, runners demonstrated significantly lower relative fat mass (9.98 \u00b1 0.56% vs. 14.91 \u00b1 1.47%, P = 0.0067) and significantly higher relative lean mass (79.18 \u00b1 0.65% vs. 75.41 \u00b1 1.28%, P = 0.019). No differences were observed with respect to glucose metabolism.",
        "The effects of LLLT were studied during muscle regeneration through gene expression.\n\nIt was evaluated 10 and 50J/cm(2) doses during 7, 14 and 21days post cryoinjury, through histopathological analysis and mRNA MyoD, Myogenin, Vegf and Cox-2 expression.\n\nIrradiated groups presented less inflammatory process than control group after 14 and 21days. Cox-2 levels were downregulated in all irradiated groups after 7, 14 and 21days. On day 7, both treated groups had a downregulation of Vegf levels, and an upregulation after 14 and 21days, mainly with 50J/cm(2). The MyoD levels were upregulated with high dose in all periods and with low dose after 21days. Myogenin expression was downregulated in both treated groups after 7days, and was upregulated with 10J/cm(2) after 21days.",
        "Despite intensive investigation the mechanism by which HIV-1 reaches the host cell nucleus is unknown. TNPO3, a karyopherin mediating nuclear entry of SR-proteins, was shown to be required for HIV-1 infectivity. Some investigators have reported that TNPO3 promotes HIV-1 nuclear import, as would be expected for a karyopherin. Yet, an equal number of investigators have failed to obtain evidence that supports this model. Here, a series of experiments were performed to better elucidate the mechanism by which TNPO3 promotes HIV-1 infectivity.\n\nTo examine the role of TNPO3 in HIV-1 replication, the 2-LTR circles that are commonly used as a marker for HIV-1 nuclear entry were cloned after infection of TNPO3 knockdown cells. Potential explanation for the discrepancy in the literature concerning the effect of TNPO3 was provided by sequencing hundreds of these clones: a significant fraction resulted from autointegration into sites near the LTRs and therefore were not bona fide 2-LTR circles. In response to this finding, new techniques were developed to monitor HIV-1 cDNA, including qPCR reactions that distinguish 2-LTR circles from autointegrants, as well as massive parallel sequencing of HIV-1 cDNA. With these assays, TNPO3 knockdown was found to reduce the levels of 2-LTR circles. This finding was puzzling, though, since previous work has shown that the HIV-1 determinant for TNPO3-dependence is capsid (CA), an HIV-1 protein that forms a mega-dalton protein lattice in the cytoplasm. TNPO3 imports cellular splicing factors via their SR-domain. Attention was therefore directed towards CPSF6, an SR-protein that binds HIV-1 CA and inhibits HIV-1 nuclear import when the C-terminal SR-domain is deleted. The effect of 27 HIV-1 capsid mutants on sensitivity to TNPO3 knockdown was then found to correlate strongly with sensitivity to inhibition by a C-terminal deletion mutant of CPSF6 (R2\\u2009=\\u20090.883, p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001). TNPO3 knockdown was then shown to cause CPSF6 to accumulate in the cytoplasm. Mislocalization of CPSF6 to the cytoplasm, whether by TNPO3 knockdown, deletion of the CPSF6 nuclear localization signal, or by fusion of CPSF6 to a nuclear export signal, resulted in inhibition of HIV-1 replication. Additionally, targeting CPSF6 to the nucleus by fusion to a heterologous nuclear localization signal rescued HIV-1 from the inhibitory effects of TNPO3 knockdown. Finally, mislocalization of CPSF6 to the cytoplasm was associated with abnormal stabilization of the HIV-1 CA core.",
        "To demonstrate the feasibility of doing a reliable rhythm analysis in the chest compression pauses (e.g. pauses for two ventilations) during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).\n\nWe extracted 110 shockable and 466 nonshockable segments from 235 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest episodes. Pauses in chest compressions were already annotated in the episodes. We classified pauses as ventilation or non-ventilation pause using the transthoracic impedance. A high-temporal resolution shock advice algorithm (SAA) that gives a shock/no-shock decision in 3s was launched once for every pause longer than 3s. The sensitivity and specificity of the SAA for the analyses during the pauses were computed.\n\nWe identified 4476 pauses, 3263 were ventilation pauses and 2183 had two ventilations. The median of the mean duration per segment of all pauses and of pauses with two ventilations were 6.1s (4.9-7.5s) and 5.1s (4.2-6.4s), respectively. A total of 91.8% of the pauses and 95.3% of the pauses with two ventilations were long enough to launch the SAA. The overall sensitivity and specificity were 95.8% (90% low one-sided CI, 94.3%) and 96.8% (CI, 96.2%), respectively. There were no significant differences between the sensitivities (P=0.84) and the specificities (P=0.18) for the ventilation and the non-ventilation pauses.",
        "We sought to characterize persons who requested to opt out of an exception from informed consent (EFIC) cardiac arrest trial and their reasons for opting out.\n\nAt one site of a multi-site, out-of-hospital, cardiac arrest EFIC trial (September 2007 - June 2009), persons who did not want to participate in the study could request an opt-out \"NO STUDY\" bracelet to prevent trial enrollment. We surveyed all persons who requested a bracelet by phone interview, web or mail. Opt-out bracelets were advertised in all public communication about the study, including community consultation and public disclosure efforts. Survey questions included demographics, Likert scale items about attitudes toward the trial and research in general, plus open-ended questions. We used descriptive statistics for standardized questions and qualitative analysis to identify common themes from open-ended questions.\n\nSixty bracelets were requested by 50 individuals. Surveys were completed by 46 persons (92% response rate). Seventy percent of respondents agreed emergency research is important, but 87% objected to any research without consent. In the qualitative analysis, 5 overlapping themes emerged: questioning the ethics of EFIC research; concerns about how the study would impact end-of-life preferences; subjective emotions including sarcasm, anger, and allusions to past unethical research; negative reference to unrelated public health controversies; and objections to the study protocol based on misinformation.",
        "There is a poor understanding of the interplay between cognitive and physiological functions in leading to falls. We hypothesized that poorer physiological function would modify the effect of poorer cognitive function on increased risk of falling in older people.\n\nA range of cognitive (executive function/attention, memory, processing speed, and visuospatial ability) and physiological functions (vision, proprioception, sway, leg strength, reaction time) were measured using standardized tests in 386 randomly selected adults aged 60-86. Incident falls were recorded over 12 months. Log-multinomial regression was used to model the relationships and test for interactions between cognition and physiological function in explaining the risk of single or multiple falls.\n\nOverall, 94 people (24.4%) had a single fall, and 78 (20.2%) had multiple falls. No significant associations were observed between cognitive function and the risk of single falls. The risk of multiple falls was increased with poorer function in Stroop dot time (RR = 1.03, 95% CI [1.01, 1.05], p = .002) and Stroop word time (RR = 1.02 [1.01, 1.03], p = .001) and reduced with better function in Category Fluency (RR = 0.94 [0.91, 0.98], p = .001) and visuospatial function (RR = 0.95 [0.92, 0.98], p < .001). These associations were amplified by the presence of greater body sway, less ambulatory physical activity, slower reaction time and gait speed, weaker muscle strength, and poorer visual contrast (p for interactions <.05).",

However, there is a large variability in the direction and extent of dopaminergic drug effects across individuals.\n\nWe investigated whether individual differences in dopaminergic drug effects on human fronto-striatal functioning are associated with individual differences in white matter tracts.\n\nThe effects of the dopamine receptor agonist bromocriptine were assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging in 22 healthy volunteers in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, within-subject design. Human psychopharmacology and functional neuroimaging were combined with functional connectivity analyses and structural connectivity analyses to establish a link between dopaminergic drug effects on fronto-striatal function and fronto-striatal anatomy.\n\nWe demonstrate that bromocriptine alters functional signals associated with attention switching in the basal ganglia. Crucially, individual differences in the drug\"s effect on these signals could be predicted from individual differences in fronto-striato-thalamic white matter tracts, as indexed by diffusion tensor imaging. Anatomical fronto-striatal connectivity also predicted drug effects on switch-related functional connectivity between the basal ganglia and the prefrontal cortex.",
        "We studied whether the severity of GH deficiency (GHD) defined as i) GH-peak on stimulation tests (insulin tolerance test (ITT), arginine, and glucagon), ii) number of additional pituitary deficits, or iii) baseline IGF1 SDS could impact the response to GH treatment. We further explored whether iv) IGF1 SDS after 24 months of GH replacement or v) \u0394IGF1 SDS from baseline to 24 months was related to the phenotypic response to GH treatment. DESIGN, PATIENTS, AND MEASUREMENTS: The patient cohort (n=1752; 50% women) was obtained from KIMS (Pfizer International Metabolic Database). The patients were divided into three groups of approximately equal size (tertiles) according to the stimulated GH-peak values and baseline IGF1 SDS and were studied at baseline, 12, and 24 months of GH therapy.\n\nLower baseline IGF1 SDS predicted better response in weight, BMI, total cholesterol, and triglycerides, while IGF1 SDS after 24 months was associated with reduction in waist/hip ratio, total cholesterol, and improved quality of life (QoL). Age-correlated negatively with the response in body weight, BMI, waist, IGF1 SDS, and total and LDL-cholesterol. Response in weight and BMI was greater in men than in women, whereas women showed greater improvement in QoL than men. Patients with more severe GHD as assessed by lower GH-peaks and more pituitary hormone deficiencies had a greater increase in IGF1 SDS. The increase in IGF1 SDS was associated with a reduction in waist/hip ratio and an increase in weight, BMI, and triglycerides. There was no correlation with other lipids, blood pressure, or glucose.",
        "It is unclear whether late THA dislocations are related to mechanical impingement or to a biological mechanism that decreases the stability provided by the capsule (eg, inflammation secondary to osteolysis). It is also unknown if alumina-on-alumina bearing couples decrease the risk of late dislocation as a result of the absence of wear and osteolysis.\n\nWe asked (1) whether the cumulative number of dislocations differed with alumina-on-alumina (AL/AL) or alumina-on-polyethylene bearings (AL/PE); (2) whether patient factors (age, sex, and diseases) affect risk of late dislocation; (3) whether mechanical factors (component malposition, penetration resulting from creep and wear) or (4) biologic hip factors at revision (thickness of the capsule, volume of joint fluid removed at surgery, histology) differed with the two bearing couples.\n\nOne hundred twenty-six patients (252 hips) with bilateral THA (one AL/AL and the contralateral AL/PE) received the same cemented implants except for the cup PE cup or an AL cup. The cumulative risk of dislocation (first-time and recurrent dislocation) was calculated at a minimum of 27 years. We measured cup position, creep and wear, and capsular thickness in the hips that had revision.\n\nAL/PE and AL/AL hips differed by the cumulative number of dislocation (31 with AL/PE versus four with AL/AL) and by the number of late dislocations (none with AL/AL, 28 with AL/PE). Cause of osteonecrosis, age, and sex affected the number of dislocations. The frequency of component malposition did not differ between the two bearing couples. The risk of late dislocation appeared less in AL/AL hips with increased capsular thickness (mean, 4.5 mm; range, 3-7 mm) compared with the thinnest (mean, 1.2 mm; range, 0.2-2 mm) capsule of AL/PE hips.",
        "Infection about a megaprosthesis is a dreaded complication. Treatment options vary from d\u00e9bridement alone to staged revisions, arthrodesis, and amputation. Indications for how to treat this complication are unclear.\n\nWe therefore determined (1) the incidence of perimegaprosthetic infections, (2) the methods of treatment, (3) the number of patients who failed their original treatment plan, and (4) the characteristics of the infection.\n\nWe retrospectively identified 291 patients who had megaprostheses implanted between 2001 and 2011 and identified all those surgically treated for a perimegaprosthetic infection during that time. We defined a treatment failure as any unplanned reoperation or death due to uncontrolled infection. All patients with failure had a minimum followup of 1 year (mean, 3.3 years; range, 1-8 years).\n\nOf the 291 patients, 31 (11%) had subsequent infections. Surgical management varied among irrigation and d\u00e9bridement (n=15), single-stage revisions (n=11), two-stage revisions (n=4), and amputations (n=1). Sixteen patients failed their original treatment plan: 13 required additional surgery and three died. Infections were mostly chronic and single organism with five being methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.",
        "Management of large and deep heel ulcers (LDHUs) is a challenge in patients with diabetic foot lesions. We assessed outcomes of a treatment protocol to save feet with LDHUs from amputation.\n\nWe managed LDHUs (larger than 3 cm(2)) in diabetic feet using a multidisciplinary approach consisting of medical and surgical management, including revascularization and amputation, if necessary. For deep heel infection and/or gangrene, we frequently debrided and drained the deep spaces of the heel, as needed. In patients with non-ischemic feet, we made a flap from the heel pad with a broad pedicle. When satisfactory granulation tissue covered the base of the heel and the inner surface of the flap, we sutured the heel flap to its base.\n\nWe managed 37 feet with LDHUs among 384 patients. Twenty-nine patients (78.4%) had neuropathy, 6 (16.2%) had ischemic diabetic feet, and 2 (5.4%) had both neuropathy and ischemia. Twelve (32.4%) had septic diabetic feet. We performed two femoropopliteal bypasses, 2 infrapopliteal bypasses, and 1 distal bypass (crural) for ischemic heel ulcers. Thirty-three of the 37 feet with heel lesions (89.2%) were salvaged using this multidisciplinary approach. These 33 LDHUs healed after 4 to 7 months (median, 6 months). Transtibial amputation was performed for 4 feet (10.8%; 2 ischemic and 2 neuropathic cases).",
        "The adverse renal effects of lithium have long been known, but glomerular insufficiency had been considered an unlikely event until recently, when new studies have raised concern regarding very long-term treatment. In this cross-sectional study, we examined glomerular function in a cohort of patients treated with lithium for up to 33 years and a control group of lithium-na\u00efve patients treated with other mood-stabilizers.\n\nPatients with a diagnosis of recurrent or persistent affective disorders, examined between 1 October 2007 and 31 December 2009, were screened. Demographic and clinical data were extracted from clinical charts regarding two study groups: one for patients treated with lithium for at least 12 months and the other for patients never exposed to lithium. Multivariate regression analysis was applied: the dependent variable was the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) calculated from the last available serum creatinine value using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study Group equation; the following independent variables, potentially associated with renal dysfunction, were included: gender, current age, duration of lithium treatment, cigarette smoking, hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia.\n\neGFRs lower than 60 ml/min were significantly more frequent in the group treated with lithium (38/139 = 27.3%) compared to lithium-na\u00efve patients (4/70 = 5.7%) (P = 0.0002; Fisher\"s test). Regression analysis showed a significant effect on eGFR of age, gender and duration of lithium treatment but no effect of cigarette smoking, hypertension, diabetes or dyslipidemia. eGFR was estimated to decrease by 0.64 ml/min (95% confidence interval = 0.38 to 0.90; P = 0.00) for each year of lithium treatment.",
        "To assess and compare the predictive value of physical function measurements (PFMs) for all-cause mortality in older men and to evaluate the Timed Up and Go test (TUG) as a predictor in subjects with underlying comorbidity.\n\nObservational study of a population-based sample of 352 ambulatory older men aged 71-86 at study baseline. The Rapid disability rating scale-2, 36-Item short form health survey, Grip strength, Five times sit-to-stand test, Standing balance, and TUG were determined at baseline. Associations with all-cause mortality were assessed using Cox proportional hazard analyses. Age, Body mass index (BMI), smoking status, education, physical activity and cognitive status were included as confounders. Follow-up exceeded 15 years. Comorbidity status was categorized into cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and diabetes mellitus.\n\nAll examined PFMs were associated with all-cause mortality. TUG was the best predictor (adjusted HR per SD increase = 1\u00b758, 95% CI = 1\u00b740-1\u00b779, P < 0\u00b7001) for global mortality and continued to be predictive in subjects with cardiovascular disease (adjusted HR per SD increase = 1\u00b780, 95% CI = 1\u00b740-2\u00b733, P < 0\u00b7001).",
        "To analyze the effects of IL-10 on the HLA-G expression and the apoptosis of trophoblasts infected with Toxoplasma gondii.\n\nT. gondii-infected or uninfected human trophoblasts and immortalized human placental BeWo cells were cultured with or without human IL-10. Uninfected and infected cells without IL-10 cells served as controls. HLA-G expression was measured by real-time PCR and flow cytometry, respectively. Cells apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry. Apoptosis associated moleculars were measured by real-time PCR and Western bolt.\n\nHLA-G expression was increased in the infected trophoblasts and BeWo cells compared to uninfected cells. Treatment of infected cells with IL-10 decreased HLA-G expression compared to infected cells while no change in treatment of uninfected cells compared with uninfected cells. Levels of apoptosis and apoptosis associated caspase-3 and caspase-8 decreased and c-FLIP levels increased in treated infected cells with IL-10 compared to infected cells and no difference in IL-10 treated uninfected cells compared to uninfected cells.",
        "Astroglial cells are frequently involved in malignant transformation. Besides apoptosis, necroptosis, a different form of regulated cell death, seems to be related with glioblastoma genesis, proliferation, angiogenesis and invasion. In the present work we elucidated mechanisms of necroptosis in cultured astrocytes, and compared them with apoptosis, caused by staurosporine.\n\nCultured rat cortical astrocytes were used for a cell death studies. Cell death was induced by different concentrations of staurosporine, and modified by inhibitors of apoptosis (z-vad-fmk) and necroptosis (nec-1). Different forms of a cell death were detected using flow cytometry.\n\nWe showed that staurosporine, depending on concentration, induces both, apoptosis as well as necroptosis. Treatment with 10(-7) M staurosporine increased apoptosis of astrocytes after the regeneration in a staurosporine free medium. When caspases were inhibited, apoptosis was attenuated, while necroptosis was slightly increased. Treatment with 10(-6) M staurosporine induced necroptosis that occurred after the regeneration of astrocytes in a staurosporine free medium, as well as without regeneration period. Necroptosis was significantly attenuated by nec-1 which inhibits RIP1 kinase. On the other hand, the inhibition of caspases had no effect on necroptosis. Furthermore, staurosporine activated RIP1 kinase increased the production of reactive oxygen species, while an antioxidant BHA significantly attenuated necroptosis.",
        "The anti-infammatory and cardioprotective effect of acetylcholine (ACh) has been reported; nevertheless, whether and how ACh exhibits an antioxidant property against ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced oxidative stress remains obscure.\n\nIn the present study, H9c2 rat cardiomyocytes were exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) to mimic I/R injury. We estimated intracellular different sources of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by measuring mitochondrial ROS (mtROS), mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number, xanthine oxidase (XO) and NADPH oxidase (NOX) activity and expression of rac 1. Cell injury was determined by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and cleaved caspase-3 expression. The siRNA transfection was performed to knockdown of M2 acetylcholine receptor (M2 AChR) expression.\n\n12-h hypoxia followed by 2-h reoxygenation resulted in an abrupt burst of ROS in H9c2 cells. Administration of ACh reduced the levels of ROS in a concentration-dependent manner. Compared to the H/R group, ACh decreased mtROS, recovered mtDNA copy number, diminished XO and NOX activity, rac 1 expression as well as cell injury. Co- treatment with atropine rather than hexamethonium abolished the antioxidant and cardioprotective effect of ACh. Moreover, knockdown of M2 AChR by siRNA showed the similar trends as atropine co-treatment group.",
        "Flexion and extension radiographs are often used in the setting of trauma to clear a cervical spine injury. The utility of such tests, however, remains to be determined. We hypothesized that in patients who underwent a negative computed tomography (CT) cervical spine scan, flexion and extension radiographs did not yield useful additional information.\n\nWe conducted a retrospective chart review of all patients admitted to a Level I trauma center who had a negative CT scan of the cervical spine and a subsequent cervical flexion-extension study for evaluation of potential cervical spine injury. All flexion-extension films were independently reviewed to determine adequacy as defined by C7/T1 visualization and 30\u00b0 of change in the angle from flexion to extension. The independent reviews were compared to formal radiology readings and the influence of the flexion-extension studies on clinical decision making was also reviewed.\n\nOne thousand patients met inclusion criteria for the study. Review of the flexion-extension radiographs revealed that 80% of the films either did not adequately demonstrate the C7/T1 junction or had less than 30\u00b0 range of motion. There was one missed injury that was also missed on magnetic resonance imaging. Results of the flexion-extension views had minimal effects on clinical decision making.",
        "Epigenetic modifications may have a role in asthma susceptibility.\n\nTo investigate whether epigenetic modification at birth of a CpG site necessary for the regulation of IL-2 transcription (IL-2 Site1) is associated with the development of asthma during childhood.\n\nMethylation of IL-2 Site1 was assessed in cord blood from 303 children (225 with atopic mothers); as controls, we measured methylation of a site not important in the transcription of IL-2 (IL-2 Site7) and methylation of the LINE-1 repetitive element. Children were followed to the age of 8 years. Information on severe asthma exacerbations and hospital admissions was collected from child\"s primary care medical record. To account for potential confounding by bronchiolitis, we used exacerbations/hospitalizations after age 1 year as primary outcomes.\n\nThere were 49 severe exacerbations amongst 33 children, and 22 hospital admissions amongst 11 children. The risk of asthma exacerbation increased 1.07-fold (95% CI 1.01-1.14, P = 0.03) and the risk of hospital admission increased 1.12-fold (95% CI 1.04-1.20, P = 0.002) for each one per cent increase in IL-2 Site1 methylation. Children who were admitted to hospital at any time-point had significantly higher IL-2 Site1 methylation than children not admitted to hospital (P = 0.007). There was a significant interaction between age at exacerbation (P = 0.03) or hospital admission (P = 0.02) and methylation, with the effect of methylation increasing with increasing age. Methylation of the control IL-2 Site7 or LINE-1 was not a significant predictor of asthma exacerbations/hospital admission, and we found no association between IL-2 Site1 methylation and hospital admissions for other reasons (0.99 [0.92-1.06]). Cord blood mononuclear cell phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphoproliferative responses decreased significantly with increasing IL-2 Site1 methylation (P < 0.001).",
        "Blockade of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) improves surrogate cardiovascular outcomes, such as left ventricular mass. Animal models of renal disease support a pathological role of mineralocorticoids, in the context of a high sodium intake. We aimed to assess the regulation of mineralocorticoid biosynthesis in patients with CKD.\n\nSeventy patients with CKD stages 3/4 and 30 patients with essential hypertension (EH) were recruited. Patients underwent detailed clinical phenotyping, drug history and biochemical assessment. Patients completed a 24-h urine collection for measurement of urinary tetrahydroaldosterone (THALDO) and tetrahydrocorticosterone (THDOC) excretion rates (measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) and urinary electrolytes. The factors which correlated significantly with THALDO and THDOC excretion were entered into linear regression models.\n\nPatients with EH and CKD were well matched with no significant differences in gender, age or weight. The mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in CKD patients was 38.6/min/1.73 m(2). The mean urinary excretion rates of THALDO, THDOC and 24-h urinary sodium (24-h USod) were not significantly different between CKD and EH patients. The level of renal function did not correlate with THALDO or THDOC excretion. In patients with CKD, 24-h USodium (r = 0.614, P < 0.001) and 24-h UPotassium (r = 0.538, P < 0.001) were positively correlated with THALDO excretion. On multivariate linear regression analysis, 24-h USod was the strongest independent predictor (P = 0.004) of THALDO and THDOC excretion in CKD. In patients with EH, no relationship was seen between mineralocorticoid excretion and 24-h urinary sodium excretion.",
        "Although the importance of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-3 has been demonstrated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the role of VEGFR-3 in functioning natural killer (NK) cells remains largely unexplored. NK cells can destroy cancer cells by releasing the cytokine interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, but NK cells in AML patients (AML NK cells) have low cytolytic activity. In the present study, we investigated whether lymphatic markers including VEGFR-3 are expressed on low-functioning AML NK cells and VEGFR-3 antagonist can restore expression of IFN-\u03b3 in NK cells.\n\nSamples from 67 de novo AML patients and 34 healthy donors were analyzed for lymphatic markers expression using RT-PCR, flow cytometry, and immunostaining. For the cytotoxicity assays, K562 cells and AML NK cells were used as target and effector cells, respectively. To block VEGFR-3, MAZ51 was added to NK cells, which were then subjected to FACS analysis.\n\nCompared with NK cells from healthy donors (healthy NK cells), AML NK cells exhibited higher levels of VEGFR-3 and lower expression of IFN-\u03b3. VEGFR-3-expressing AML NK cells were less potent than healthy NK cells in terms of killing K562 cells. The level of IFN-\u03b3 in AML NK cells was increased by VEGFR-3 antagonist treatment, indicating the functional relevance of VEGFR-3 in IFN-\u03b3-secreting NK cells.",
        "The inflammatory response after cardiac surgery is characterized by a profound release of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Recent data suggest that the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines is of greater importance than the absolute levels. Retransfusion of unwashed cardiotomy suction blood contributes to the inflammatory response, but the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in cardiotomy suction blood and whether cell salvage before retransfusion influences the systemic balance have not been investigated previously.\n\nTwenty-five coronary artery bypass grafting patients were randomized to either cell salvage of cardiotomy suction blood or no cell salvage before retransfusion. Plasma levels of three anti-inflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonist, IL-4 and IL-10] and two proinflammatory cytokines (tumour necrosis factor-alpha and IL-6), and the IL-6-to-IL-10 ratio was measured in cardiotomy suction blood before and after cell salvage, and in the systemic circulation before, during and after surgery.\n\nPlasma levels of all cytokines except IL-4 and IL-10 were significantly higher in cardiotomy suction blood than in the systemic circulation. The IL-6-to-IL-10 ratio was 6-fold higher in cardiotomy suction blood than in the systemic circulation [median 10.2 (range 1.1-75) vs 1.7 (0.2-24), P < 0.001]. Cell salvage reduced plasma levels of cytokines in cardiotomy suction blood and improved the systemic IL-6-to-IL-10 ratio 24 h after surgery [median 5.2 (3.6-17) vs 12.4 (4.9-31)] compared with no cell salvage (P = 0.032).",
        "Surgical site infection (SSI) can be a problematic complication of Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS). Previous reports have cited nasal Staphylococcus aureus (S.\\u2009aureus) carriage as a risk factor for SSI, but none thus far in dermatologic surgery.\n\nThe aim was to determine the difference in infection rates between nasal carriers of S.\\u2009aureus and non-carriers, and whether decolonisation with intranasal mupirocin ointment and chlorhexidine wash would reduce the infection rate in nasal carriers.\n\nIn all, 738 patients presenting for MMS at the Oxford Day Surgery and Dermatology underwent a nasal swab to determine their S.\\u2009aureus carriage status. S.\\u2009aureus carriers were randomised for decolonisation with intranasal mupirocin ointment and chlorhexidine body wash. Non-carriers were untreated. All patients were followed up for SSI.\n\nThe rate of SSI was 11 per cent in untreated S.\\u2009aureus carriers, 4 per cent in treated carriers, and 3 per cent in non-carriers. The difference in infection rate between carriers and non-carriers was significant (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001). The difference between treated and untreated carriers was also significant (P\\u2009=\\u20090.05).",
        "Autoimmune gastritis (AIG), an organ-specific autoimmune disease, is accompanied by achlorhydria, pernicious anemia, gastric carcinoid tumors, and gastric cancer. Patients with AIG initially respond to corticosteroids but have a great potential to relapse after treatment is withdrawn. This study examines the roles of cytokines in order to identify potential therapeutic options for AIG patients.\n\nUsing a mouse model of AIG, we monitored disease progression and administered antibodies in vivo to block cytokines.\n\nWe developed a mouse model of AIG with early onset and rapid progression in which neonatal thymectomy (NTx) was performed on programmed cell death 1-deficient (PD-1(-/-) ) mice on the BALB/c background. Using NTx-PD-1(-/-) mice, we found that in AIG lesions, interferon-\u03b3, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 together with interleukin-21 (IL-21) were highly expressed in the inflamed gastric mucosa. In addition, as with the injection of dexamethasone, in vivo administration of either anti-TNF-\u03b1 or anti-IL-21 suppressed the development of AIG in NTx-PD-1(-/-) mice.",
        "The aim of this study was to gain insight in the inflammatory response in acute heart failure (AHF) by assessing (1) plasma cytokine profiles and (2) prognostic value of circulating cytokines in AHF patients.\n\nPlasma levels of 26 cytokines were quantified by multiplex protein arrays in 36 patients with congestive AHF, characterized by echocardiographic, radiologic, and clinical examinations on admission, during hospitalization and at discharge. Recurrent AHF leading to death or readmission constituted the combined end point, and all patients were followed for 120 days after discharge. Levels of 15 of the measured cytokines were higher in AHF than in healthy subjects (n=22) on admission. Low levels of MCP-1, IL-1\u03b2 and a low IL-1\u03b2/IL-1ra ratio predicted fatal and non-fatal AHF within 120 days. Patients with low circulating levels of IL-1\u03b2 had lower left ventricular ejection fraction and higher levels of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, while patients with low levels of MCP-1 had higher E/E\" and inferior caval vein diameter, than patients with high levels.",
        "This in vitro study aimed to compare the antibacterial effect of a new irrigant, QMiX, with that of conventional irrigation solutions in the presence or absence of dentin powder.\n\nDentin powder was prepared from bovine incisors and sterilized. The following irrigants were tested against Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212): 6% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), 1% NaOCl, QMiX, 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX), and 17% EDTA. Sterilized saline solution was used as negative control. Survival of bacteria exposed to the irrigants in the presence or absence of dentin was monitored under planktonic conditions. Colony-forming units were counted, and log-transformed numbers were analyzed by using Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests. P values less than .05 were considered significant.\n\nIn the absence of dentin, after 10 seconds of contact with the bacterial suspension, 6% NaOCl showed the lowest bacterial count; the difference to the negative control was significant. After 30 seconds, 6% NaOCl displayed 0 colony-forming units per milliliter, whereas 1% NaOCl and QMiX showed reduced number of colonies in comparison with the negative control. After 1 minute, both concentrations of NaOCl presented no bacterial growth and QMiX reduced the number of colonies, but EDTA and CHX had bacterial counts similar to the negative control. Dentin had a significant inhibitory effect on 6% NaOCl (10 seconds), 1% NaOCl (10 seconds and 1 minute), and QMiX (10 seconds and 1 minute). After 6 hours, both concentrations of NaOCl, QMiX, and CHX killed all bacteria, regardless of the presence of dentin.",
        "There is growing evidence that training on virtual reality simulators leads to improved performance in the animate and human operating room. However, they are expensive, have a limited availability, and involve complex systems. Portable simulators are significantly cheaper, more user-friendly, and are flexible systems that are more suited to a surgical trainee\"s busy schedule. The use of portable surgical simulators to train skills and reduce errors has never been evaluated in prospective, randomized clinical settings. The objective of this study was to determine if training on the portable Integrated Laparoscopic Simulator leads to improved performance of core laparoscopic skills.\n\nCore laparoscopic skills were identified by five experienced laparoscopic surgeons and modeled into two exercises and three basic tasks. Twenty surgically naive medical students had baseline laparoscopic skills assessed on a fixed simulator. Participants were randomized to either 14 h training on a portable laparoscopic simulator over a 3 week period, or control with no training. At 3 weeks two expert laparoscopic surgeons blinded to the allocation of participants assessed their pre- and post-intervention performances recorded on a CD-ROM. The outcome measures included time to complete and global rating scores of clipping and dissection tasks.\n\nNo differences were observed in baseline skills level between the two groups. The intervention group had better quality of scissors dissection (p = 0.0038) and improved clipping skills (p = 0.0051), and they took less time to accomplish the tasks (p = 0.0099) in comparison to control.",
        "It is well accepted that mold exposure is a major contributor to the development of asthma, and beta-glucans are often used as a surrogate for mold exposure in the environment. Beta-glucans are an important component of mold spores and are recognized by the immune system by their receptor, Dectin-1. Cladosporium cladosporioides spores have a high beta-glucan content, but the beta-glucans are not available on the surface of live spores.\n\nWe sought to determine whether altering the exposure of beta-glucans in C cladosporioides through heat killing could alter the immune response through binding to Dectin-1.\n\nIn a murine model of mold-induced asthma, mice were repeatedly exposed to either live or heat-killed C cladosporioides and the phenotype was determined by the measurement of airway hyperresponsiveness, airway inflammation, and cytokine production. Pro-inflammatory cytokines from dendritic cells were measured by using quantitative PCR and ELISA.\n\nLive C cladosporioides induced robust airway hyperresponsiveness, eosinophilia, and a predominately TH2 response, while heat-killed C cladosporioides induced a strong TH17 response and neutrophilic inflammation, but very mild airway hyperresponsiveness. Heat killing of C cladosporioides spores effectively exposed beta-glucans on the surface of the spores and increased binding to Dectin-1. In the absence of Dectin-1, heat-killed spores induced a predominantly TH2 response analogous to live spores. Furthermore, the production of TH17-skewing IL-6, IL-23, and TNF-\u03b1 by dendritic cells in response to heat-killed C cladosporioides was dependent on Dectin-1.",
        "Previous studies have suggested that antim\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) levels are positively associated with in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcome through their relationship with oocyte yield and not by reflecting oocyte or embryo quality.\n\nThe aim was to investigate whether AMH levels are associated with pregnancy and live-birth rates and whether the results may also reflect qualitative aspects of oocytes and embryos.\n\nThe study was a prospective cohort study between April 2008 and June 2011.\n\nThe study was done at a university-affiliated private infertility center.\n\nThe study cohort consisted of 892 consecutive women undergoing 1230 IVF-intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycles.\n\nAMH levels, analyzed using the DSL ELISA kit, were statistically adjusted for repeated treatments and age and analyzed for associations with treatment outcome.\n\nPregnancy rates, live-birth rates, and stimulation outcome parameters were measured.\n\nAMH was log-normally distributed with a mean (SD) of 2.3 (2.5) ng/mL. Live-birth rates per started cycle (mean [95% confidence interval]) increased log-linearly from 10.7% [7.2-14.1] for AMH < 0.84 ng/mL (25th percentile) to 30.8% [25.7-36.0] for AMH > 2.94 ng/mL (75th percentile), Ptrend < .0001, being superior in women with polycystic ovaries. These findings were significant also after adjustments were made for age and oocyte yield. AMH was also associated with ovarian response variables and embryo scores.",
        "Voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) in rat neurohypophysial terminals exhibit molecular tolerance to alcohol, including desensitization to the drug and increased current density, after 3\\xa0weeks of alcohol drinking. Moreover, after this time, terminals from drinking rats exhibit diminished alcohol inhibition of vasopressin (AVP) release.\n\nWe took advantage of organotypic cultures (explants) of the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial system (HNS) to extend our analysis of molecular tolerance to 2 classes of the VGCC. The isolated HNS explant allows much finer temporal resolution of molecular tolerance than do voluntary drinking paradigms. After exposure of the HNS explant to alcohol, terminals are isolated by mechanical treatment and plated in a dish. Patch clamp recording techniques are used to obtain VGCC currents, and immunohistochemistry is used to determine VGCC distribution. A release assay is used to provide functional readout of AVP release.\n\nWe show that even a brief, 1-hour exposure to a clinically relevant concentration of alcohol is sufficient to evoke similar changes to those observed after several weeks of exposure. Acute ethanol (EtOH) exposure inhibits high K(+) -induced AVP release from na\u00efve terminals. However, terminals pre-exposed to 20\\xa0mM EtOH for 1\\xa0hour become tolerant to EtOH, and subsequent exposure has significantly less effect on high K(+) -induced AVP release. Electrophysiological recordings indicate that among different types of VGCCs present in the neuronal terminal, the L-type is the most affected by alcohol. The current density of L-type current is significantly increased (approximately 50%), while its responsiveness to alcohol is significantly diminished (approximately 50%), after brief alcohol exposure. Fluorescent imaging results were consistent with the electrophysiology and suggest that the increased current density of VGCCs after brief exposure is attributable to combined synthesis of 1.2 and 1.3 subtypes of the L-type VGCC and redistribution of channel protein into terminal plasma membrane.",
        "The aim of this study was to characterize the permeability kinetics of salbutamol sulfate, a commonly used \u03b22-agonist in the treatment of asthma exacerbation, across Calu-3 respiratory epithelial cell monolayers in the presence of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), as they have been implicated to be able to modulate organic cation transporters (OCTs).\n\nCalu-3 cell monolayers were grown in a liquid covered culture (LCC) configuration on 0.33 cm(2) Transwell polyester cell culture supports. Monolayers, cultured between 11 and 14 days were evaluated for epithelial resistance, tight junction integrity, and expression of OCT using Western blot analysis. The transport of salbutamol across the monolayer was studied as a function of concentration. Directional transport was investigated by assessing apical-basal (a-b) and basal-apical (b-a) directions. The influence of a non-specific OCT inhibitor (tetraethylammonium, TEA) and three NSAIDs (aspirin, ibuprofen, and indomethacin) on the uptake of salbutamol was studied.\n\nThe flux of salbutamol sulfate increased with increasing concentration before reaching a plateau, suggesting the involvement of a transport-mediated uptake mechanism. Western blot analysis detected the presence of OCT1-3 and N1 and N2 sub-types, suggesting the presence of functioning transporters. The apparent permeability (P(app)) of 0.1 mM salbutamol across the epithelial monolayer displayed directional transport in the a-b direction which was inhibited by \u02dc70% in the presence of TEA, suggesting OCT-mediated uptake. Likewise, the uptake of 0.1 mM salbutamol was decreased in the presence of all the three NSAIDs, supporting a mechanism whereby NSAIDs inhibit absorption of salbutamol across the bronchial epithelium via effects on the OCT transporters.",
        "In myeloid cells the inflammasome plays a crucial role in innate immune defenses against pathogen- and danger-associated patterns such as crystalline silica. Respirable mineral particles impinge upon the lung epithelium causing irreversible damage, sustained inflammation and silicosis. In this study we investigated lung epithelial cells as a target for silica-induced inflammasome activation.\n\nA human bronchial epithelial cell line (BEAS-2B) and primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) were exposed to toxic but nonlethal doses of crystalline silica over time to perform functional characterization of NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-1\u03b2, bFGF and HMGB1. Quantitative RT-PCR, caspase-1 enzyme activity assay, Western blot techniques, cytokine-specific ELISA and fibroblast (MRC-5 cells) proliferation assays were performed.\n\nWe were able to show transcriptional and translational upregulation of the components of the NLRP3 intracellular platform, as well as activation of caspase-1. NLRP3 activation led to maturation of pro-IL-1\u03b2 to secreted IL-1\u03b2, and a significant increase in the unconventional release of the alarmins bFGF and HMGB1. Moreover, release of bFGF and HMGB1 was shown to be dependent on particle uptake. Small interfering RNA experiments using siNLRP3 revealed the pivotal role of the inflammasome in diminished release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, danger molecules and growth factors, and fibroblast proliferation.",
        "The aim of this study was to examine the prospective relationship between a history of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) assessed in mid-adolescence and the onset of major depressive disorder (MDD) through early adulthood in a large school-based sample. A secondary aim was to examine whether this relationship was robust after accounting for comorbid psychopathology and psychosocial impairment.\n\nOne thousand five hundred seven participants from the Oregon Adolescent Depression Project completed rating scales in adolescence and structured diagnostic interviews up to four times from adolescence to age 30.\n\nAdolescents with a lifetime history of ADHD were at significantly higher risk of MDD through early adulthood relative to those with no history of ADHD. ADHD remained a significant predictor of MDD after controlling for gender, lifetime history of other psychiatric disorders in adolescence, social and academic impairment in adolescence, stress and coping in adolescence, and new onset of other psychiatric disorders through early adulthood (hazard ratio, 1.81; 95% confidence interval, 1.04, 3.06). Additional significant, robust predictors of MDD included female gender, a lifetime history of an anxiety disorder, and poor coping skills in mid-adolescence, as well as the onset of anxiety, oppositional defiant disorder, and substance-use disorder after mid-adolescence.",
        "Integrating interactive three-dimensional post-processing software into undergraduate radiology teaching might be a promising approach to synergistically improve both visual-spatial ability and radiological skills, thereby reducing students\" deficiencies in image interpretation. The purpose of this study was to test our hypothesis that a hands-on radiology course for medical students using interactive three-dimensional image post-processing software improves radiological knowledge, diagnostic skills and visual-spatial ability.\n\nA hands-on radiology course was developed using interactive three-dimensional image post-processing software. The course consisted of seven seminars held on a weekly basis. The 25 participating fourth- and fifth-year medical students learnt to systematically analyse cross-sectional imaging data and correlated the two-dimensional images with three-dimensional reconstructions. They were instructed by experienced radiologists and collegiate tutors. The improvement in radiological knowledge, diagnostic skills and visual-spatial ability was assessed immediately before and after the course by multiple-choice tests comprising 64 questions each. Wilcoxon signed rank test for paired samples was applied.\n\nThe total number of correctly answered questions improved from 36.9\u00b14.8 to 49.5\u00b15.4 (p<0.001) which corresponded to a mean improvement of 12.6 (95% confidence interval 9.9-15.3) or 19.8%. Radiological knowledge improved by 36.0% (p<0.001), diagnostic skills for cross-sectional imaging by 38.7% (p<0.001), diagnostic skills for other imaging modalities - which were not included in the course - by 14.0% (p=0.001), and visual-spatial ability by 11.3% (p<0.001).",
        "Today industrialized countries face a burgeoning aged population. Thus, there is increasing attention on the functioning and disabilities of aged adults as potential determinants of autonomy and independent living. However, there are few representative findings on the prevalence and determinants of disability in aged persons in the German population.The objective of our study is to examine the frequency, distribution and determinants of functioning and disability in aged persons and to assess the contribution of diseases to the prevalence of disability.\n\nData originate from the MONICA/KORA study, a population-based epidemiological cohort. Survivors of the original cohorts who were 65 and older were examined by telephone interview in 2009. Disability was assessed with the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI). Minimal disability was defined as HAQ-DI > 0. Logistic regression was used to adjust for potential confounders and additive regression to estimate the contribution of diseases to disability prevalence.\n\nWe analyzed a total of 4117 persons (51.2% female) with a mean age of 73.6 years (SD = 6.1). Minimal disability was present in 44.7% of all participants. Adjusted for age and diseases, disability was positively associated with female sex, BMI, low income, marital status, physical inactivity and poor nutritional status, but not with smoking and education. Problems with joint functions and eye diseases contributed most to disability prevalence in all age groups.",
        "To evaluate the validity of, characterize the usage of, and propose potential research applications for International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) tobacco codes in clinical populations.\n\nUsing data on cancer cases and cancer-free controls from Vanderbilt\"s biorepository, BioVU, we evaluated the utility of ICD-9 tobacco use codes to identify ever-smokers in general and high smoking prevalence (lung cancer) clinic populations. We assessed potential biases in documentation, and performed temporal analysis relating transitions between smoking codes to smoking cessation attempts. We also examined the suitability of these codes for use in genetic association analyses.\n\nICD-9 tobacco use codes can identify smokers in a general clinic population (specificity of 1, sensitivity of 0.32), and there is little evidence of documentation bias. Frequency of code transitions between \"current\" and \"former\" tobacco use was significantly correlated with initial success at smoking cessation (p<0.0001). Finally, code-based smoking status assignment is a comparable covariate to text-based smoking status for genetic association studies.",
        "The aim of the present study was to highlight the sonographic and clinical characteristics of large (\u226530\\xa0mm in diameter) scar endometriomas near Pfannenstiel incisions, assuming that large size is a marker of delayed diagnosis.\n\nWe compared clinical, ultrasound (US) and color Doppler findings in 13 patients (mean age 31.3 years) with 13 large scar endometriomas (L-SEs) (mean lesion diameter 41.8\\xa0mm; range 30-60\\xa0mm) and 17 women (mean age 30.7 years) with 19 small scar endometriomas (S-SEs) (mean lesion size 18.3\\xa0mm; range 7-26\\xa0mm).\n\nCompared with the S-SE group, the L-SE group had a significantly longer mean interval between the last cesarean section and hospital admission (5.5 vs. 3.3 years; p\\xa0<\\xa00.01) and longer mean duration of symptoms before admission (43 vs. 17.4 months; p\\xa0<\\xa00.01). The L-SE group also had a significantly higher percentage of patients who had undergone at least one inconclusive diagnostic examination (Computed Tomography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, fine needle biopsy, or laparoscopy) (39% vs. 0%; p\\xa0<\\xa00.05). As for US findings, L-SEs more frequently displayed cystic regions and fistulous tracts (p\\xa0<\\xa00.05), loss of round/oval shape (p\\xa0<\\xa00.05), and increased vascularity (p\\xa0<\\xa00.05).",
        "Effective adjuvant chemotherapy (Adj.C) for completely resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was recently established. However, there may be some unresolved adverse effects, as have been observed in early stage populations or long-term survivors after other types of Adj.C. The substantial risk in such patients was examined by a mathematical method.\n\nVariables X and Y were defined by two outcomes of Adj.C: X = the ability to eliminate micro-metastasis and Y = the development of effects that threaten life. Then, the following formula was generated: Survival benefit = (death rate) X - (death rate) X Y - (survival rate) Y. We then solved for X and Y and verified our findings using reported data from clinical trials.\n\nBy solving two simultaneous equations for the formula applied to the data for stage (1) IA and (2) IIIA in the LACE study (J Clin Oncol 26:5043-5051, 2008), X and Y were 2.6 and 1.9, respectively. When these values were applied in the formula for stage IB patients in the same study, the theoretical (-2.3 %) and reported values (2.5 %) were close. When these were applied for stage IB-IIIA patients in the IALT study (N Engl J Med 350:351-360, 2004), the theoretical (5.0 %) and reported values (4.1 %) were also similar.",
        "The intestinal mucus layer protects the epithelium from noxious agents, viruses, and pathogenic bacteria present in the gastrointestinal tract. It is composed of mucins, predominantly mucin (Muc) 2, secreted by goblet cells of the intestine. Experimental alcoholic liver disease requires translocation of bacterial products across the intestinal barrier into the systemic circulation, which induces an inflammatory response in the liver and contributes to steatohepatitis. We investigated the roles of the intestinal mucus layer, and in particular Muc2, in development of experimental alcohol-associated liver disease in mice. We studied experimental alcohol-induced liver disease, induced by the Tsukamoto-French method (which involves continuous intragastric feeding of an isocaloric diet or alcohol) in wild-type and Muc2(-/-) mice. Muc2(-/-) mice showed less alcohol-induced liver injury and steatosis than developed in wild-type mice. Most notably, Muc2(-/-) mice had significantly lower plasma levels of lipopolysaccharide than wild-type mice after alcohol feeding. In contrast to wild-type mice, Muc2(-/-) mice were protected from alcohol-associated microbiome changes that are dependent on intestinal mucins. The antimicrobial proteins regenerating islet-derived 3 beta and gamma were expressed at significantly higher levels in the jejunum of Muc2(-/-) mice fed the isocaloric diet or alcohol compared with wild-type mice. Consequently, Muc2(-/-) mice showed increased killing of commensal bacteria and prevented intestinal bacterial overgrowth.",
        "To investigate whether poststroke dementia (PSD) diagnosed after ischaemic stroke predicts recurrent ischaemic stroke in long-term follow-up.\n\nWe included 486 consecutive patients with ischaemic stroke (388 with first-ever stroke) admitted to Helsinki University Central Hospital who were followed-up for 12 years. Dementia was diagnosed in 115 patients using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd edition (DSM-III) criteria. The effects of risk factors and \\xa0PSD on survival free of recurrent stroke were estimated using Kaplan-Meier log-rank analyses, and the HRs for stroke recurrence were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models.\n\nIn the entire cohort, patients with PSD had a shorter mean time to recurrent stroke (7.13 years, 95% CI 6.20 to 8.06) than patients without dementia (9.41 years, 8.89 to 9.92; log rank p<0.001). This finding was replicated in patients with first-ever stroke (6.89 years, 5.85 to 7.93 vs 9.68 years, 9.12 to 10.24; p<0.001). In Cox univariate analysis, PSD was associated with increased risk for recurrent stroke both in the entire cohort (HR 2.02; 95% CI 1.47 to 2.77) and in those with first-ever stroke (2.40; 1.68 to 3.42). After adjustment for the significant covariates of age, atrial fibrillation, peripheral arterial disease and hypertension, PSD was associated with increased risk for recurrent stroke both in the entire cohort (1.84; 1.34 to 2.54) and in those with first-ever stroke (2.16; 1.51 to 3.10).",
        "White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are associated with vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) but fail to correlate with neuropsychological measures. As proton MR spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) can identify ischaemic tissue, we hypothesised that MRS detectable brain metabolites would be superior to WMHs in predicting performance on neuropsychological tests.\n\n60 patients with suspected VCI underwent clinical, neuropsychological, MRI and CSF studies. They were diagnosed as having subcortical ischaemic vascular disease (SIVD), multiple infarcts, mixed dementia and leukoaraiosis. We measured brain metabolites in a white matter region above the lateral ventricles with (1)H-MRS and WMH volume in this region and throughout the brain.\n\nWe found a significant correlation between both total creatine (Cr) and N-acetylaspartyl compounds (NAA) and standardised neuropsychological test scores. Cr levels in white matter correlated significantly with executive function (p=0.001), attention (p=0.03) and overall T score (p=0.007). When lesion volume was added as a covariate, NAA also showed a significant correlation with executive function (p=0.003) and overall T score (p=0.015). Furthermore, while metabolite levels also correlated with total white matter lesion volume, adjusting the Cr levels for lesion volume did not diminish the strength of the association between Cr levels and neuropsychological scores. The lowest metabolite levels and neuropsychological scores were found in the SIVD group. Finally, lesion volume alone did not correlate significantly with any neuropsychological test score.",
        "The small G-protein ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (RAC1) plays various roles in mammalian cells, such as in the regulation of cytoskeletal organisation, cell adhesion, migration and morphological changes. The present study examines the effects of RAC1 ablation on pancreatic beta cell function.\n\nIsolated islets from pancreatic beta cell-specific Rac1-knockout (betaRac1(-/-)) mice and RAC1 knockdown INS-1 insulinoma cells treated with small interfering RNA were used to investigate insulin secretion and cytoskeletal organisation in pancreatic beta cells.\n\nBetaRac1(-/-) mice showed decreased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, while there were no apparent differences in islet morphology. Isolated islets from the mice had blunted insulin secretion in response to high glucose levels. In RAC1 knockdown INS-1 cells, insulin secretion was also decreased in response to high glucose levels, consistent with the phenotype of betaRac1(-/-) mice. Even under high glucose levels, RAC1 knockdown INS-1 cells remained intact with F-actin, which inhibits the recruitment of the insulin granules, resulting in an inhibition of insulin secretion.",
        "To investigate the effect of support and growth medium (GM) on Pleurotus ostreatus biofilm production, specific metabolic activity (SMA) and ultrastructure.\n\nBiofilms were developed on membranes covering a broad range of surface properties and, due to the applicative implications of mixed biofilms, on standard bacterial GM in stationary and shaken culture. Hydrophilic (glass fibre, Duran glass and hydroxyapatite) and mild hydrophobic (polyurethane, stainless steel, polycarbonate, nylon) supports were more adequate for biofilm attachment than the hydrophobic Teflon. Among the GM, sucrose-asparagine (SA) was more conducive to biofilm production than Luria-Bertani and M9. GM was more influential than support type on biofilm ultrastructure, and a high compactness was evident in biofilms developed on SA. Biofilms on Duran glass were more efficient than planktonic cultures in olive-mill wastewater treatment.",
        "Low-grade gliomas (LGGs) are rare brain neoplasms, with survival spanning up to a few decades. Thus, accurate evaluations on how biomarkers impact survival among patients with LGG require long-term studies on samples prospectively collected over a long period.\n\nThe 210 adult LGGs collected in our databank were screened for IDH1 and IDH2 mutations (IDHmut), MGMT gene promoter methylation (MGMTmet), 1p/19q loss of heterozygosity (1p19qloh), and nuclear TP53 immunopositivity (TP53pos). Multivariate survival analyses with multiple imputation of missing data were performed using either histopathology or molecular markers. Both models were compared using Akaike\"s information criterion (AIC). The molecular model was reduced by stepwise model selection to filter out the most critical predictors. A third model was generated to assess for various marker combinations.\n\nMolecular parameters were better survival predictors than histology (\u0394AIC = 12.5, P< .001). Forty-five percent of studied patients died. MGMTmet was positively associated with IDHmut (P< .001). In the molecular model with marker combinations, IDHmut/MGMTmet combined status had a favorable impact on overall survival, compared with IDHwt (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.33, P< .01), and even more so the triple combination, IDHmut/MGMTmet/1p19qloh (HR = 0.18, P< .001). Furthermore, IDHmut/MGMTmet/TP53pos triple combination was a significant risk factor for malignant transformation (HR = 2.75, P< .05).",
        "Lymph lymph node metastasis from melanoma \u22640.50 mm (ultrathin) is an infrequent event. However, because many newly diagnosed melanomas are ultrathin, a significant proportion of patients who present with lymph node disease have an ultrathin melanoma. The authors hypothesized that ultrathin melanomas that present with lymph node metastasis represent biologically aggressive lesions with a worse prognosis.\n\nThe Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry data were queried to identify patients with cutaneous melanoma who presented with lymph node metastasis diagnosed between 1998 and 2008. Hazard ratios (HRs) from Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to compare disease-specific survival (DSS) between various tumor depths.\n\nIn total, 6134 patients with lymph node-positive melanoma were identified and stratified according to tumor depth, including 588 (10%) with a tumor depth \u22640.50 mm, 519 (8%) with a tumor depth from 0.51 to 1.00 mm, 1669 (27%) with a tumor depth from 1.01 to 2.00 mm, 1871 (31%) with a tumor depth from 2.01 to 4.00 mm, and 1487 (24%) with a tumor depth >4.00 mm; and the respective 5-year DSS rates were 63%, 76%, 75%, 60%, and 43%. Multivariable analysis confirmed a similar trend in HRs for DSS: The HR was 1.00 for a tumor depth \u22640.50 mm (reference category) and 0.64 (P < .001), 0.65 (P < .001), 0.95 (P = .57), and 1.42 (P < .001) for tumor depths of 0.51 to 1.00 mm, 1.01 to 2.00 mm, 2.01 to 4.00 mm, and >4.00 mm, respectively.

On each test occasion, they initially self-assessed their motor condition (from \"very off\" to \"very dyskinetic\") and then performed a set of fine motor tests (tapping and spiral drawings).\n\nThe motor tests scores were found to be the best during self-rated On. Self-rated dyskinesias caused more impaired spiral drawing performance (mean\\xa0=\\xa09.8% worse, P\\xa0<\\xa00.001) but at the same time tapping speed was faster (mean\\xa0=\\xa05.0% increase, P\\xa0<\\xa00.001), compared to scores in self-rated Off.",
        "The aim of this study was to define TAC1 and TACR1 methylation profiles for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) tumors at diagnosis and follow-up and to evaluate their prognostic significance and value as a biomarker of recurrence.\n\nTAC1 and TACR1 expression was measured in a panel of cell lines by quantitative RT-PCR. The TAC1 and TACR1 promoter methylation status was determined by quantitative methylation-specific PCR.\n\nMethylation was associated with TAC1 and TACR1 transcription inhibition. TAC1 methylation in 49/100 (49 %) of HNSCC tumor specimens significantly correlated with p16 methylation (P = 0.010), E-cadherin methylation (P = 0.041), galanin methylation (P = 0.037), and disease-free survival (P = 0.002). Stage III and IV patients manifesting TAC1 hypermethylation had significantly shorter survivals than did patients without TAC1 methylation (P = 0.022). TACR1 methylation in 34/100 (34 %) cases was significantly correlated with galanin methylation (P = 0.014) and GALR1 methylation (P = 0.004). TAC1 promoter hypermethylation was statistically correlated with reduced disease-free survival (log-rank test, P = 0.002). In multivariate logistic-regression analysis, methylation of TAC1 and of the gene pair TAC1 and TACR1 was associated with an odds ratio for recurrence of 3.35 (95 % CI, 1.37-8.19; P = 0.008) and 5.09 (95 % CI, 1.44-18.02; P = 0.011), respectively.",

This study aims to identify personality traits and maladaptive coping strategies that could predict affective symptoms in early post-ACS patients.\n\nSeventy patients undergoing revascularization procedures were examined within a week after their admission by means of the Hospital Anxiety-Depression Scale. Personality was analyzed through the Type D Personality Scale and the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situation. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to determine independent predictors of anxiety and depressed mood.\n\nA high rate of depressive and anxious symptoms was found and 76% of patients resulted Type D personality.

Unmarried status, low education, unstable angina, Type D personality, emotion, and avoidance oriented coping independently predicted anxiety.",
        "According to current guidelines, skin testing for hymenoptera venom allergy should be performed in a stepwise manner, maintaining 15- to 20-min intervals between the injections of venom. Given the long-winded procedure of sequential skin testing, we retrospectively explored the safety of simultaneous intradermal testing.\n\nFour hundred and seventy-eight consecutive patients with a convincing history of an anaphylactic reaction after a hymenoptera sting were tested. All venom concentrations (0.02\\xa0ml of 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 1.0\\xa0\u03bcg/ml of honey bee and wasp venom) were administered simultaneously to the skin.\n\nFour hundred and seventy-two (98.7%) patients tolerated the simultaneous intradermal test without any side-effects.

        "Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, with knee osteoarthritis being the leading cause of lower extremity disability among older adults in the US. There are no treatments available to prevent the structural pathology of osteoarthritis. Because of vitamin K\"s role in regulating skeletal mineralization, it has potential to be a preventative option for osteoarthritis. We therefore examined the relation of vitamin K to new-onset radiographic knee osteoarthritis and early osteoarthritis changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n\nSubjects from the Multicenter Osteoarthritis (MOST) Study had knee radiographs and MRI scans obtained at baseline and 30 months later, and plasma phylloquinone (vitamin K) measured at baseline. We examined the relationship of subclinical vitamin K deficiency to incident radiographic knee osteoarthritis and MRI-based cartilage lesions and osteophytes, respectively, using log binomial regression with generalized estimating equations, adjusting for potential confounders.\n\nAmong 1180 participants (62% women, mean age 62\u00b18 years, mean body mass index 30.1\u00b15.1 kg/m(2)), subclinical vitamin K deficiency was associated with incident radiographic knee osteoarthritis (risk ratio [RR] 1.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-2.25) and cartilage lesions (RR 2.39; 95% CI, 1.05-5.40) compared with no deficiency, but not with osteophytes (RR 2.35; 95% CI, 0.54-10.13). Subclinically vitamin K-deficient subjects were more likely to develop osteoarthritis in one or both knees than neither knee (RR 1.33; 95% CI, 1.01-1.75 and RR 2.12; 95% CI, 1.06-4.24, respectively).",
        "CD73 converts extracellular AMP to adenosine which is well known to inhibit lipolysis. It is unknown, however, whether adenosine formed directly by CD73 is functionally relevant in this process.\n\nWe therefore explored the effect of CD73-derived adenosine on body fat of aged mice.\n\nIn lean mice, extracellular adenosine formation by adipocytes is dependent on CD73. High fat diet down-regulates the expression of CD73 in wildtype mice similar to ob/ob mice. Transgenic mice chronically lacking CD73 (CD73(-/-)) gain significantly less body weight and show decreased superficial white fat content as well as increased serum free fatty acids and triglycerides. In addition, intramyocellular lipid levels are significantly increased. This phenotype is accompanied by an increase in blood glucose and serum insulin levels although insulin secretion and the level of insulin degrading enzyme are unaltered. Additionally, insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation is reduced in skeletal muscle of CD73(-/-) mice.",
        "The impact of obesity on hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) outcome remains controversial and has been considered a relative contraindication for the procedure. We investigated the influence of Body Mass Index (BMI) on the clinical course of adults undergoing an ambulatory HSCT after a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen.\n\nAdults with hematologic diseases undergoing an autologous or allogeneic HSCT after reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) and supported exclusively with enteral nutrition (EN) were studied. BMI and body fat were sequentially determined. Patients were divided into three BMI subgroups: underweight; normal, and overweight/obese.\n\nSeventy-seven patients with a median follow-up of 21months were evaluated. Fourteen (18.2%) were underweight, 21 (27.3%) had a normal weight, and 42 (54.5%) were overweight/obese. A significant weight loss was observed among all three weight groups after HSCT (P=0.014). No correlation was found between time to engraftment and BMI (P=0.91), serum albumin (P=0.387), and fasting glucose (P=0.64), nor between BMI and acute (P=0.456) or chronic (P=0.209) graft versus host disease (GVHD).

        "The association between past stroke subtypes and recurrent stroke subtypes in non-cardiogenic stroke remains unknown.\n\nPatients with ischaemic stroke who had a past history of large-artery disease (LAD) or small-artery disease (SAD) subtypes were assessed. LAD was subdivided into intracranial atherosclerosis (ICAS) and extracranial atherosclerosis (ECAS). LAD stroke mechanisms were categorized as artery-to-artery embolism, in situ thrombotic occlusion and local branch occlusion, while SAD was subdivided into lacunar infarction (LI) and branch atheromatous disease (BAD) on the basis of magnetic resonance imaging findings. The relationship between past and current strokes was analyzed.\n\nAmong the 202 patients enrolled, the LAD group (n\\u2005=\\u2005111) had 64 and 47 patients with ICAS and ECAS, and the SAD group (n\\u2005=\\u200591) had 63 and 28 patients with LI and BAD, respectively, at the time of past stroke. Patients with LAD developed LAD-associated strokes most often (n\\u2005=\\u200599, 89.2%), and patients with SAD developed SAD most often (n\\u2005=\\u200569, 75.8%; P\\u2005<\\u20050.001). Patients with ICAS were more likely to develop ICAS later (n\\u2005=\\u200546, 79.3%), whereas those with ECAS developed ECAS more often (n\\u2005=\\u200531, 75.6%; P\\u2005<\\u20050.001). Patients with ICAS presenting with artery-to-artery embolism more often developed artery-to-artery embolism later (n\\u2005=\\u200526, 72.2%), whereas those with local branch occlusion developed recurrent local branch occlusion most often (n\\u2005=\\u200510, 66.7%, P\\u2005=\\u20050.005). In the SAD group, patients with BAD developed LAD more frequently than the LI group (n\\u2005=\\u200511, 39.3% vs. n\\u2005=\\u20059, 14.3%, P\\u2005=\\u20050.022).",
        "Direct in vivo MRI of dental hard tissues by applying ultrashort echo time (UTE) MRI techniques has recently been reported. The objective of the presented study is to clinically evaluate the applicability of UTE MRI for the identification of caries lesions.\n\n40 randomly selected patients (mean age 41 \u00b1 15 years) were enrolled in this study. 39 patients underwent a conventional clinical assessment, dental bitewing X-ray and a dental MRI investigation comprising a conventional turbo-spin echo (TSE) and a dedicated UTE scan. One patient had to be excluded owing to claustrophobia. In four patients, the clinical treatment of the lesions was documented by intraoral pictures, and the resulting volume of the cavity after excavation was documented by dental imprints and compared with the MRI findings.\n\nIn total, 161 lesions were identified. 157 (97%) were visible in the UTE images, 27 (17%) in the conventional TSE images and 137 (85%) in the X-ray images. In total, 14 teeth could not be analysed by MR owing to artefacts caused by dental fillings. All lesions appear significantly larger in the UTE images as compared with the X-ray and TSE images. In situ measurements confirm the accuracy of the lesion dimensions as observed in the UTE images.",
        "Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality among older people. We have studied whether its prevalence can be reduced by a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA).\n\n1000 randomly-selected persons aged \u226575 years were divided into intervention (n = 500) and control groups (n = 500). We focused on those subjects in whom an orthostatic blood pressure test had been performed at least once during the study period (2004-2007) (n = 365 and 332 for intervention and control groups, respectively). A CGA, including evaluation of the adequacy of the medication, was performed annually in the intervention group but not in the control group. We conducted Markov models to study change in the OH profiles and the effect of CGA on it. Competing risk of mortality was modeled as an absorbing state to avoid attrition bias.\n\nOver 3 years, the prevalence of OH decreased (35.0% \u2192 28.0%) in the intervention group, whereas its prevalence increased in the control group (32.8% \u2192 40.8%). By Markov models it was shown that CGA had a statistically significant effect on recovering from OH. In addition, CGA was shown to protect from developing OH.",
        "Deep oceans have been suggested as a possible site where the origin of life occurred. Along with this theoretical lineage, experiments using components from deep ocean water to recreate life is underway. Here, we propose that if terrestrial organisms indeed evolved from deep oceans, supply of deep ocean mineral water (DOM) to humans, as a land creature, may replenish loss of molecular complexity associated with evolutionary sea-to-land migration.\n\nWe conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover human study to evaluate the effect of DOM, taken from a depth of 662 meters off the coast of Hualien, Taiwan, on time of recovery from a fatiguing exercise conducted at 30\u00b0C.\n\nThe fatiguing exercise protocol caused a protracted reduction in aerobic power (reduced VO2max) for 48 h. However, DOM supplementation resulted in complete recovery of aerobic power within 4 h (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Muscle power was also elevated above placebo levels within 24 h of recovery (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05). Increased circulating creatine kinase (CK) and myoglobin, indicatives of exercise-induced muscle damage, were completely eliminated by DOM (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05) in parallel with attenuated oxidative damage (P\\u2009<\\u20090.05).",
        "This study aimed to determine if preoperative time course changes in serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels can predict clinical outcome of surgical intervention for active infective endocarditis.\n\nSurgically treated patients (n = 109) with active infective endocarditis were reviewed retrospectively. We divided the patients into 2 subgroups according to preoperative transition of increasing or decreasing serum CRP levels, and performed a comparative study. The increasing CRP group included 29 patients and the decreasing CRP group included 80 patients.\n\nThere were more patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and New York Heart Association functional class IV in the increasing CRP group. Hospital mortality was significantly higher in the increasing CRP group (34.5%) than that in the decreasing CRP group (5.0%) (p <0.05). In multivariate analysis, 3 significant risk factors of surgical outcome were identified: a tendency for increasing preoperative CRP levels (odds ratio [OR]: 18.15, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03-320.78), nosocomial infective endocarditis (OR: 18.73, 95% CI: 1.57-223.60), and dialysis (OR: 1025.46, 95% CI: 2.89-363587.12).",
        "In Africa, data on Chlamydia trachomatis infection are scarce because reliable diagnosis is costly and not widely available. Our objective was to evaluate the incidence and correlates of C. trachomatis infection among high-risk Kenyan women.\n\nWe conducted prospective cohort analyses using data from a cohort of women who reported transactional sex. C. trachomatis testing was performed using the Gen-Probe Aptima GC/CT Detection System. We used Andersen-Gill proportional hazards modeling to evaluate correlates of C. trachomatis.\n\nBetween August 2006 and December 2010, 865 women contributed 2011 person-years of observation. Sixty-four women experienced 101 episodes of C. trachomatis infection (incidence rate, 5.0/100 person-years). There was a large difference in incidence by age group: those younger than 25 years had an incidence of 27.6 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI], 16.3-46.5), those 25 to 34 years old had an incidence of 8.4 per 100 person-years (95% CI, 6.4-11.0), and those 35 years and older had an incidence of 2.6 per 100 person-years (95% CI, 1.8-3.6). In multivariate analyses, younger age (<25 and 25-34 years vs. \u226535 years; hazard ratio [HR], 8.5 [95% CI, 4.1-17.7] and 2.9 [95% CI, 1.7-5.0], respectively), depot medroxyprogesterone acetate use (HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-3.0), and recent Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection (HR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.5-7.4) were significantly associated with increased risk of acquiring C. trachomatis infection.",
        "Plasma alphafetoprotein (AFP) concentrations are high at birth and decline progressively to reach adult levels between eight and 24 months of age. AFP is an important tumour marker for hepatoblastoma but may also increase following hepatic resection. The liver and intestine have similar embryonic origins from endoderm, so we postulated that plasma AFP may also rise after extensive bowel resection.\n\nAFP was measured postoperatively in plasma in four infants who had undergone resections of large amounts of intestine. AFP was measured twice in two babies and multiple times in the other two.\n\nIn three of the four infants, the AFP concentrations were markedly above the expected levels for age, and in all four babies, AFP concentrations rose when they may have been expected to fall.",
        "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding regulatory RNAs that control gene expression usually producing translational repression and gene silencing. High-throughput sequencing technologies have revealed heterogeneity at length and sequence level for the majority of mature miRNAs (IsomiRs). Most isomiRs can be explained by variability in either Dicer1 or Drosha cleavage during miRNA biogenesis at 5\" or 3\" of the miRNA (trimming variants). Although isomiRs have been described in different tissues and organisms, their functional validation as modulators of gene expression remains elusive. Here we have characterized the expression and function of a highly abundant miR-101 5\"-trimming variant (5\"-isomiR-101).\n\nThe analysis of small RNA sequencing data in several human tissues and cell lines indicates that 5\"-isomiR-101 is ubiquitously detected and a highly abundant, especially in the brain. 5\"-isomiR-101 was found in Ago-2 immunocomplexes and complementary approaches showed that 5\"-isomiR-101 interacted with different members of the silencing (RISC) complex. In addition, 5\"-isomiR-101 decreased the expression of five validated miR-101 targets, suggesting that it is a functional variant. Both the binding to RISC members and the degree of silencing were less efficient for 5\"-isomiR-101 compared with miR-101. For some targets, both miR-101 and 5\"-isomiR-101 significantly decreased protein expression with no changes in the respective mRNA levels. Although a high number of overlapping predicted targets suggest similar targeted biological pathways, a correlation analysis of the expression profiles of miR-101 variants and predicted mRNA targets in human brains at different ages, suggest specific functions for miR-101- and 5\"-isomiR-101.",
        "Plant parasitism represents an extraordinary interaction among flowering plants: parasitic plants use a specialized organ, the haustorium, to invade the host vascular system to deprive host plants of water and nutrients. Various compounds present in exudates of host plants trigger haustorium development. The two most effective haustorium inducing factors (HIFs) known for the parasitic plant Triphysaria versicolor (T. versicolor) are peonidin, an antioxidant flavonoid, and 2,6-dimethoxybenzoquinone (DMBQ), an oxidative stress agent. To date, two genes involved in haustorium initiation in T. versicolor have been identified: TvQR1, a quinone oxidoreductase that generates the active HIF from DMBQ, and TvPirin, a transcription co-factor that regulates several other DMBQ- responsive and -non-responsive genes. While the expression of these genes in response to DMBQ is well characterized, their expression in response to peonidin is not. In addition, the pattern of polymorphisms in these genes is unknown, even though nucleotide changes in TvQR1 and TvPirin may have contributed to the ability of T. versicolor to develop haustoria. To gain insights into these aspects, we investigated their transcriptional responses to HIFs and non-HIF and their natural nucleotide diversity.\n\nHere we show that TvQR1 and TvPirin are transcriptionally upregulated by both DMBQ and peonidin in T. versicolor roots. Yet, while TvQR1 also responded to juglone, a non-HIF quinone with toxicity comparable to that of DMBQ, TvPirin did not. We further demonstrate that TvPirin encodes a protein shorter than the one previously reported. In the T. versicolor natural population of Northern California, TvQR1 exhibited remarkably higher molecular diversity and more recombination events than TvPirin, with the highest non-synonymous substitution rate in the substrate recognition and catalytic domain of the TvQR1 protein.",
        "In endometrial carcinoma, myometrial invasion is a well known predictor of recurrence, and important in the decision making for adjuvant treatment. According to the FIGO staging system, myometrial invasion is expressed as invasion of <50%> of the myometrium (50%MI). It has been suggested to use the absolute depth of invasion (DOI), or the tumor free distance to the serosa (TFD). The aim of this study was to compare DOI, 50%MI, and TFD.\n\nAll patients diagnosed with endometrioid endometrial carcinoma at the RUNMC, and the CWH from 1999 to 2009 were included. Histologic slides were reviewed for histologic type and grade, DOI, 50%MI, and TFD. After review, 335 patients were identified. DOI, 50%MI, and TFD were evaluated for their prediction of clinicopathologic characteristics.\n\nThe prediction of recurrence was best performed by DOI when compared to TFD, with an area under the ROC curve of 0.726, and 0.638 respectively. The optimal cut-off value for DOI was 4mm. DOI independently correlated with recurrence of disease, and death of disease. TFD was associated with advanced age and large tumor diameter. DOI was the best predictor of progression-free and disease-specific survival next to 50%MI and TFD (HR 3.15, 95%CI 1.16-8.56) and (HR 10.35, 95%CI 1.23-86.93).",
        "Despite early diagnosis of prostate cancer, seminal vesicle invasion is still a common clinical scenario nowadays. The objective of this study is to evaluate clinical and pathological prognostic factors in that subgroup of patients.\n\nAfter approval of our Ethical Committee, we selected all pT3b prostate cancer patients operated between 1987 and 2010. Neoadjuvant treatment patients were excluded. The biochemical free survival periods BFS and the period free of complementary treatment were calculated with the Kaplan Meier method. Cox regression model was used to select those variables associated with biochemical failure and the need for complementary treatment. We considered complementary treatment when radiotherapy or hormone therapy in an adjuvant or salvage scheme was required.\n\n101 patients were selected from 1470 procedures. Among these, 28 patients died (27,7%), 18 due to tumor, and 74 showed biochemical relapse (73,3%). The median follow up was of 4 years and 4 months. The five years BFS was 30.2% (IC 95%: 20.2-40.1), whereas the 5 year period free of complementary treatment was 16.9% (IC 95%: 8.1-25.8%). In the multivariate analysis, margin status (R) was independently and significantly associated with biochemical relapse and the need for complementary treatment. Likewise, the preoperative PSA was associated to biochemical relapse and N1 tumours were clearly associated to complementary treatment.",
        "Previous studies have indicated that the antimicrobial efficacy of endodontic irrigants may be diminished in the presence of patient tissues and fluids. With Streptococcus gordonii as a model microorganism, we used a genetic approach to investigate the hypothesis that bacterial surface proteins with collagen-binding abilities may function to protect biofilm cells from antiseptics commonly used in root canal treatment.\n\nS. gordonii strain DL1 or isogenic mutant strains with deletions of genes encoding collagen-binding surface proteins were grown in microtiter plates to form 8-hour biofilms. Planktonic cells were aspirated, and the remaining biofilm cells were buffer-washed and then incubated with either pH-adjusted buffer or potentially protective solutions of type I collagen, serum, or saliva. Biofilms were rewashed, pulsed with sodium hypochlorite, chlorhexidine digluconate, or BioPure MTAD, and then rewashed. Fresh medium was added, and survivor cell growth was monitored for 24 hours.\n\nBuffer-treated biofilm cells of all 3 strains were similarly killed by sodium hypochlorite, chlorhexidine digluconate, and MTAD. Collagen, serum, and saliva significantly protected strain DL1 from all 3 antiseptics compared with buffer-treated cells (P \u2264 .0004). However, preincubation with collagen, serum, or saliva left both mutant strain biofilms significantly more susceptible to all 3 antiseptics than were respectively treated strain DL1 biofilms (P \u2264 .005).",
        "CD44 is a transmembrane glycoprotein with various biological functions. Histologic studies have shown that CD44 is strongly expressed in odontoblasts at the appositional stage of tooth development. We investigated whether CD44 is involved in the mineralization of dental pulp cells.\n\nTen human third molars with incomplete root formation were collected and processed for immunohistochemistry of CD44. Dental pulp cells isolated from another 5 human third molars were assayed for their viability, alkaline phosphatase activity, and alizarin red staining in vitro after silencing stably their expression of CD44 by using the short hairpin RNA technique. The CD44 knockdown cells were cultured on a collagen sponge and transplanted subcutaneously into the dorsal surfaces of immunocompromised mice. After 6 weeks, the subcutaneous tissues were processed for alizarin red staining and immunohistochemistry of human specific antigen. The dental pulp cells transduced with control short hairpin RNA were used as the control in all assays.\n\nCD44 is expressed in odontogenic cells with active mineral deposition during tooth development. Odontoblasts in the root ends of immature teeth express a stronger CD44 signal compared with those in the crown portion. When CD44 expression was stably suppressed in dental pulp cells, their mineralization activities were substantially decreased in both in vitro and in vivo assays.",
        "Dental pulp functions include pulp cell activity involvement in dentin formation. In this study we investigated the age-related changes in dental pulp cells that may influence pulp cell activity for restoring pulp function.\n\nHuman dental pulp cells (HDPCs) were serially subcultured until spontaneously arrested. Altered expression of chronic inflammatory molecules and age-related molecules were determined by Western blotting. Odontogenic functions impaired by senescence were assayed by Western blotting, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, alkaline phosphatase activity, and alizarin red S staining. To understand the mechanism of aging process by stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS), the cells were treated with H(2)O(2). Replicative senescence and SIPS were also compared.\n\nReplicative senescence of HDPCs was characterized by senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase activity and reactive oxygen species formation. These cells exhibited altered expression of chronic inflammatory molecules such as intracellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma, and heme oxygenase-1 and age-related molecules such as p53, p21, phosphorylated-extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and c-myb. SIPS cell results were similar to replicative senescence. Furthermore, HDPCs decreased odontogenic markers such as dentin sialophosphoprotein and dentin matrix-1 and osteogenic markers such as bone morphogenetic protein-2 and -7, runt-related transcription factor-2, osteopontin, alkaline phosphatase activity, and mineralized nodule formation by replicative senescence and SIPS.",
        "To assess the relation between retinal vascular caliber and renal function.\n\nEighty apparently healthy subjects screened for cardiovascular risk factors (mean age 47 years, 51% female, 36% hypertensive, without diabetes or renal dysfunction) were recruited. Retinal vascular calibers were measured from fundus photographs and expressed as central retinal artery and venular equivalent. Renal function was assessed by measurement of glomerular filtration rate (urinary clearance of 99mTc-DTPA) and urinary albumin/creatinine ratio.\n\nMean glomerular filtration rate was 117 ml/min/1.73m(2). Overall, central retinal artery and venular equivalent were positively correlated with glomerular filtration rate (r = +0.31, p = 0.005 and r = +0.30, p = 0.006, respectively). In addition, central retinal artery equivalent was negatively correlated with urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (r = -0.34, p = 0.002). No significant relationship was found between central retinal venular equivalent and urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (r = +0.12, p = 0.32). The observed relations between retinal vascular calibers and renal function parameters remained significant after adjusting for potential confounding factors.",
        "Dextromethorphan (DXM), a commonly used antitussive, is a dextrorotatory morphinan. Here, we report that DXM inhibits the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption by abrogating the activation of NF-\u03baB signalling in vitro. Oral administration of DXM ameliorates ovariectomy (OVX)-induced osteoporosis in vivo.\n\nDXM was reported to possess anti-inflammatory properties through inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory factors. However, the potential role and action mechanism of DXM on osteoclasts and osteoblasts remain unclear. In this study, in vitro and in vivo studies were performed to investigate the potential effects of DXM on osteoclastogenesis and OVX-induced bone loss.\n\nOsteoclastogenesis was examined by the TRAP staining, pit resorption, TNF-\u03b1 release, and CCR2 and CALCR gene expression. Osteoblast differentiation was analyzed by calcium deposition. Osteogenic and adipogenic genes were measured by real-time PCR. Signaling pathways were explored using Western blot. ICR mice were used in an OVX-induced osteoporosis model. Tibiae were measured by \u00b5CT and serum markers were examined with ELISA kits.\n\nDXM inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. DXM mainly inhibited osteoclastogenesis via abrogation of IKK-I\u03baB\u03b1-NF-\u03baB pathways. However, a higher dosage of DXM antagonized the differentiation of osteoblasts via the inhibition of osteogenic signals and increase of adipogenic signals. Oral administration of DXM (20 mg/kg/day) partially reduced trabecular bone loss in ovariectomized mice.",
        "Deciphering the molecular and cellular processes that govern macrophage foam cell formation is critical to understanding the basic mechanisms underlying atherosclerosis and other vascular pathologies.\n\nHere, we identify a pivotal role of plasminogen (Plg) in regulating foam cell formation. Deficiency of Plg inhibited macrophage cholesterol accumulation on exposure to hyperlipidemic conditions in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo. Gene expression analysis identified CD36 as a regulated target of Plg, and macrophages from Plg(-/-) mice had decreased CD36 expression and diminished foam cell formation. The Plg-dependent CD36 expression and foam cell formation depended on conversion of Plg to plasmin, binding to the macrophage surface, and the consequent intracellular signaling that leads to production of leukotriene B4. Leukotriene B4 rescued the suppression of CD36 expression and foam cell formation arising from Plg deficiency.",
        "Endovascular repair is associated with better 30-day outcomes than open surgical repair for patients with infrarenal aortic aneurysms. In patients with complex aortic aneurysms (CAAs) requiring suprarenal or supravisceral aortic cross-clamping during open repair, few data exist directly comparing the real-world outcomes of open repair versus endovascular repair with fenestrated-branched stent grafts (FEVAR).\n\nOutcomes for patients who underwent elective CAA repair using open repair and FEVAR between 2005 and 2010 were analyzed using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database. CAA was defined as aneurysm of the aorta involving the visceral and/or renal arteries.\n\nThis study compared 1091 patients who underwent open repair (group A: male, 71.5%; age, 71 \u00b1 9 years) with 264 patients treated with FEVAR (group B: male, 82.2%; age, 74 \u00b1 9 years). The 2 groups did not significantly differ with respect to American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification (ASA III/IV: A, 93%; B, 95%, P = 0.6), severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (A: 21%; B: 22%; P = 0.7), prior cardiac surgery (A: 24%; B: 20%; P = 0.19), or preoperative renal function (glomerular filtration rate: A: 69 \u00b1 2; B: 70 \u00b1 27; P = 0.535). Group A had significantly higher risk of any complication (A: 42%; B: 19%; P < 0.001), nonsurgical complications (A: 30%; B: 8%; P < 0.001), pulmonary complications (A: 21%; B: 2%; P < 0.001), renal complications (A: 10%; B: 1.5%; P = 0.001), and any cardiovascular complication (A: 8%; B: 2%; P < 0.001). The composite end point of surgical site infections/graft failure/bleeding transfusions were also higher in group A (A: 22%; B: 15%; P = 0.014). Thirty-day mortality was significantly lower for FEVAR (A: 5.4%; B: 0.8%; P = 0.001), as was total length of hospital stay (A: 11 \u00b1 10 days; B: 4 \u00b1 5 days; P < 0.001).",
        "This study sought to determine whether survival in this cohort of patients was adversely affected by increased residential altitude.\n\nThe success of the Fontan procedure depends in large part on low pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). Factors that increase PVR, including an increase in residential altitude, may adversely affect long-term outcome. Higher altitude has been shown to affect functional well-being in patients with a Fontan circulation.\n\nDatabases from a tertiary cardiac care center in the Intermountain West (elevation 5,000 feet) were analyzed for patients born with single-ventricle anatomy who would now be of adult age. Complete data were then collected on all identified patients who subsequently underwent the Fontan operation. Correlates of, and time to, adverse outcome, defined as death, cardiac transplantation, or clinical decompensation requiring a move to sea level, were determined.\n\nOf 149 patients with single-ventricle anatomy, 103 underwent the Fontan procedure, with 70 surviving to adulthood at moderate altitude. Adverse outcome occurred in 55, with death in 24 (23%), cardiac transplantation in 18 (17%), and clinical decompensation requiring move to sea level in 13 (13%). There was no relationship between type, age at, or era of Fontan procedure and long-term outcome. Correlates of long-term, transplant-free survival at moderate altitude included lower residential altitude (4,296 vs. 4,637 feet, p < 0.001), and lower pulmonary artery pressures before the Fontan procedure (13 vs. 15 mm Hg, p = 0.01), and after (14 vs. 18 mm Hg, p = 0.01).",
        "To determine if acoustic radiation force impulse elastography-derived bowel wall shear wave velocity (SWV) allows distinction of acutely inflamed from fibrotic intestine in a Crohn disease animal model.\n\nUniversity Committee on the Use and Care of Animals approval was obtained. An acute inflammation Crohn disease model was produced by treating eight Lewis rats with a single administration of trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) enema, with imaging performed 2 days later in the surviving six rats. Colonic fibrosis in an additional eight Lewis rats was achieved by administering repeated TNBS enemas during 4 weeks, with imaging performed in the surviving seven rats 7 days later to allow acute inflammation resolution. Nine transcutaneous bowel wall SWV measurements were obtained from the colon in all rats without and with applied strain. Mean SWVs without and with applied strain were compared between animal cohorts by using the Student t test, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were created to assess diagnostic performance.\n\nMean bowel wall SWVs were significantly higher for fibrotic versus acute inflammation cohort of rats at 0% (3.4 \u00b1 1.1 vs 2.3 \u00b1 0.5 m/sec; P = .047) and 30% (6.3 \u00b1 2.2 vs 3.6 \u00b1 0.9 m/sec; P = .02) applied strain. Both acute inflammation and fibrotic cohort of rats demonstrated linear increases in mean SWV with increasing applied strain, with significantly different mean slopes (P = .02) and y-intercepts (P = .02). The area under the ROC curve of the SWV ratio (mean SWV/applied strain) for differentiating histopathologically confirmed fibrotic from inflamed bowel was 0.971.",
        "Viral infections are the most frequent cause of asthma exacerbations and are linked to increased airway reactivity (AR) and inflammation. Mice infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) during ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic airway inflammation (OVA/RSV) had increased AR compared with OVA or RSV mice alone. Furthermore, interleukin 17A (IL-17A) was only increased in OVA/RSV mice.\n\nTo determine whether IL-17A increases AR and inflammation in the OVA/RSV model.\n\nWild-type (WT) BALB/c and IL-17A knockout (KO) mice underwent mock, RSV, OVA or OVA/RSV protocols. Lungs, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and/or mediastinal lymph nodes (MLNs) were harvested after infection. Cytokine expression was determined by ELISA in the lungs or BAL fluid. MLNs were restimulated with either OVA (323-229) peptide or RSV M2 (127-135) peptide and IL-17A protein expression was analysed. AR was determined by methacholine challenge.\n\nRSV increased IL-17A protein expression by OVA-specific T cells 6 days after infection. OVA/RSV mice had decreased interferon-\u03b2 protein expression compared with RSV mice. OVA/RSV mice had increased IL-23p19 mRNA expression in lung homogenates compared with mock, OVA or RSV mice. Unexpectedly, IL-17A KO OVA/RSV mice had increased AR compared with WT OVA/RSV mice. Furthermore, IL-17A KO OVA/RSV mice had increased eosinophils, lymphocytes and IL-13 protein expression in BAL fluid compared with WT OVA/RSV mice.",
        "Intestinotrophic therapies, such as glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) analogs, may enhance intestinal adaptation and reduce dependence on parenteral nutrition (PN) in patients with intestinal failure associated with short bowel syndrome (SBS-IF). However, because GLP-2 enhances cellular growth, there is concern that GLP-2 analogs may also encourage growth of malignant cells.\n\nTo histologically examine the effects of teduglutide, a recombinant human GLP-2 analog, on the mucosa of the small and large intestine for indications of dysplastic transformation.\n\nIn a multicenter, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study, 83 PN-dependent patients with SBS-IF were monitored for several weeks to ensure optimal and stable PN. Patients were then randomized to receive 24 weeks of placebo (n=16), teduglutide (0.5 mg/kg/d; n=35), or teduglutide (0.10 mg/kg/d; n=32).\n\nBiopsies were obtained from 77 patients to yield 390 individual histologic interpretations. After 6 months of treatment, no features of dysplasia were found in any biopsy from the large or small intestine of patients receiving placebo or either dose of teduglutide. New secondary diagnoses, such as eosinophilic colitis or Crohn\"s disease, were found at a low frequency overall: teduglutide (0.05 mg/kg/d; range, 3.1% to 6.3%); teduglutide (0.10 mg/kg/d, 3.3%); placebo (range, 6.7% to 13.3%).",
        "Skeletal muscle adipose tissue (AT) infiltration (myosteatosis) increases with aging and may contribute to the development of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). It remains unclear if myosteatosis is associated to glucose and insulin homeostasis independent of total and central adiposity.\n\nThe association between intermuscular AT (IMAT) in the abdominal skeletal muscles (total, paraspinal, and psoas) and fasting serum glucose, insulin, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in 393 nondiabetic Caucasian men aged 65+ was evaluated. Abdominal IMAT, visceral AT (VAT), and subcutaneous AT (SAT) (cm(3) ) were measured by quantitative computed tomography at the L4-L5 intervertebral space.\n\nIn age, study site, height, and muscle volume adjusted regression analyses, total abdominal and psoas (but not paraspinal) IMAT were positively associated with glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR (all P < 0.003). The associations between total abdominal and psoas IMAT and insulin and HOMA-IR remained significant after further adjusting for lifestyle factors, as well as duel-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measured total body fat, VAT, or SAT in separate models (all P < 0.009).",
        "A limited amount of data exist regarding the effect of intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) and graduated compression stockings (GCS) on the incidence of VTE in the ICU setting. The objective of this study was to examine the association of mechanical thromboprophylaxis with IPC or GCS with the risk of VTE and hospital mortality among critically ill medical-surgical patients.\n\nIn this prospective cohort study of patients admitted to the ICU of a tertiary-care medical center between July 2006 and January 2008, we used multiple propensity scores adjustment to examine the association of IPC and GCS with VTE. The primary outcome was incident VTE, including DVT and pulmonary embolism. The following data were collected: patient demographics, admission physiologic data, VTE risk factors, pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis, and mechanical thromboprophylaxis.\n\nAmong 798 patients enrolled in the study, incident VTE occurred in 57 (7.1%). The use of IPC was associated with a significantly lower VTE incidence compared with no mechanical thromboprophylaxis (propensity scores adjusted hazard ratio, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.22-0.95; P=.04). GCS were not associated with decreased VTE incidence. No significant interaction was found between the mechanical thromboprophylaxis group and the type of prophylactic heparin used (P=.99), recent trauma (P=.66), or recent surgery (P=.07) on VTE risk.",

        "Pharmacological blockade showed sympathetic origin of 0.03 to 0.15 Hz blood pressure (BP) oscillations and parasympathetic origin of 0.15 to 0.5 Hz RR-interval (RRI) oscillations, but has not been used to determine origin of cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) oscillations at these frequencies. This study evaluated by pharmacological blockade whether 0.1 Hz CBFV oscillations are related to sympathetic and 0.2 Hz CBFV oscillations to parasympathetic modulation.\n\nIn 11 volunteers (24.6 \u00b1 2.3 years), we monitored RRIs, BP, and proximal middle cerebral artery CBFV, at rest, during 180 s sympathetic BP activation by 0.1 Hz sinusoidal neck suction (NS), and during 180 s parasympathetic RRI activation by 0.2 Hz NS. We repeated recordings after 25 mg carvedilol, and after 0.04 mg/kg atropine. Autoregressive analysis quantified RRI-, BP-, and CBFV-spectral powers at 0.1 Hz and 0.2 Hz. We compared parameters at rest, during 0.1 Hz, or 0.2 Hz NS, with and without carvedilol or atropine (analysis of variance, post hoc testing; significance, P<0.05).\n\nCarvedilol significantly increased RRIs and lowered BP, CBFV, and 0.1 Hz RRI-, BP-, and CBFV-powers at baseline (P=0.041 for CBFV-powers), and during 0.1 Hz NS-induced sympathetic activation (P<0.05). At baseline and during 0.2 Hz NS-induced parasympathetic activation, atropine lowered RRIs and 0.2 Hz RRI-powers, but did not change BP, CBFV, and 0.2 Hz BP- and CBFV-powers.",
        "Patient-reported outcome measures have been found useful in many disciplines but have received limited evaluation after stroke. The current study investigated the relationship that patient-reported measures have with standard impairment and disability scales after stroke.\n\nPatients with motor deficits after stroke were scored on standard assessments including the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, modified Rankin Scale, and Fugl-Meyer motor scale, and on 2 patient-reported measures, the hand function domain of the Stroke Impact Scale, which documents difficulty of hand motor usage, and the amount of use portion of the Motor Activity Log, which records amount of arm motor usage.\n\nThe 43 participants had mild disability (median modified Rankin Scale=2), moderate motor deficits (Fugl-Meyer motor scale=46 \u00b1 22), and mild cognitive/language deficits. The 2 patient-reported outcome measures, Stroke Impact Scale and Motor Activity Log, were sensitive to the presence of arm motor deficits. Of 21 patients classified as having minimal or no impairment or disability by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale or modified Rankin Scale (score of 0-1), 15 (71%) reported difficulty with hand movements by the Stroke Impact Scale score or reduced arm use by the Motor Activity Log score.

        "A correlation has been found between periodontal disease (PD) and stroke. This study was conducted to investigate whether dental prophylaxis and periodontal treatment reduce the incidence rate (IR) of ischemic stroke.\n\nWe identified 510 762 PD cases and 208 674 non-PD subjects from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2010. The PD cases were divided into dental prophylaxis, intensive treatment, and no treatment groups. The stroke IRs were assessed among groups during follow-up. Cox regression analysis was used after adjustment for age, sex, and comorbidities to determine the relationship between periodontal treatment and incidence of ischemic stroke.\n\nThe stroke IR of the non-PD subjects was 0.32%/year. In the PD group, subjects who received dental prophylaxis had the lowest stroke IR (0.14%/year); subjects with intensive treatment or tooth extraction had a higher stroke IR (0.39%/year); and subjects without PD treatment had the highest stroke IR (0.48%/year; P<0.001). After adjustment for confounders, the dental prophylaxis and intensive treatment groups had a significant lower hazard ratios for stroke than the non-PD group (hazard ratio=0.78 and 0.95; 95% confidence interval=0.75-0.81 and 0.91-0.99, respectively), whereas the PD without treatment group had a significant higher hazard ratio for stroke (1.15; 95% confidence interval=1.07-1.24), especially among the youngest (20-44) age group (hazard ratio=2.17; 95% confidence interval=1.64-2.87) after stratifying for age.",
        "Alternatively polarized macrophages (M\u03d5) shape the microenvironment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and temper anticancer immune responses. We investigated if sorafenib alters the HCC microenvironment by restoring classical macrophage polarization and triggering tumor-directed natural killer (NK) cell responses. In vivo experiments were conducted with sorafenib (25 mg/kg)-treated C57BL/6 wildtype as well as hepatitis B virus (HBV) and lymphotoxin transgenic mice with and without HCC. Monocyte-derived M\u03d5 or tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) isolated from HCC tissue were treated with sorafenib (0.07-5.0 \u03bcg/mL) and cocultured with autologous NK cells. M\u03d5 and NK cell activation was analyzed by flow cytometry and killing assays, respectively. Cytokine and growth factor release was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Short-term administration of sorafenib triggered activation of hepatic NK cells in wildtype and tumor-bearing mice. In vitro, sorafenib sensitized M\u03d5 to lipopolysaccharide, reverted alternative M\u03d5 polarization and enhanced IL12 secretion (P = 0.0133). NK cells activated by sorafenib-treated M\u03d5 showed increased degranulation (15.3 \u00b1 0.2% versus 32.0 \u00b1 0.9%, P < 0.0001) and interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3) secretion (2.1 \u00b1 0.2% versus 8.0 \u00b1 0.2%, P < 0.0001) upon target cell contact. Sorafenib-triggered NK cell activation was verified by coculture experiments using TAM. Sorafenib-treated M\u03d5 increased cytolytic NK cell function against K562, Raji, and HepG2 target cells in a dose-dependent manner. Neutralization of interleukin (IL)12 or IL18 as well as inhibition of the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) pathway reversed NK cell activation in M\u03d5/NK cocultures.",
        "The new criteria for preclinical Alzheimer disease (AD) proposed 3 stages: abnormal levels of \u03b2-amyloid (stage 1), stage 1 plus evidence of brain injury (stage 2), and stage 2 plus subtle cognitive changes (stage 3). However, a large group of subjects with normal \u03b2-amyloid biomarkers have evidence of brain injury; we labeled them as the \"suspected non-Alzheimer pathophysiology\" (sNAP) group. The characteristics of the sNAP group are poorly understood.\n\nUsing the preclinical AD classification, 430 cognitively normal subjects from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging who underwent brain magnetic resonance (MR), (18)fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), and Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography (PET) were evaluated for FDG PET regional volumetrics, MR regional brain volumetrics, white matter hyperintensity volume, and number of infarcts. We examined cross-sectional associations across AD preclinical stages, those with all biomarkers normal, and the sNAP group.\n\nThe sNAP group had a lower proportion (14%) with apolipoprotein E \u03b54 genotype than the preclinical AD stages 2 + 3. The sNAP group did not show any group differences compared to stages 2 + 3 of the preclinical AD group on measures of FDG PET regional hypometabolism, MR regional brain volume loss, cerebrovascular imaging lesions, vascular risk factors, imaging changes associated with \u03b1-synucleinopathy, or physical findings of parkinsonism.",

Aim of this study was to investigate the osteogenic differentiation of human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (HPdLF) depending on the applied strength of mechanical strain compared to osteoblasts (HOB).\n\nHPdLF and HOB were loaded with different strengths (1%, 5% and 10%) of static mechanical strain (SMS) for 12h in vitro. Viability was verified by MTT and apoptosis by TUNEL assay. Gene expression of cyclin D1, collagen type-1 (COL-I), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteocalcin, osteoprotegerin (OPG) and receptor activator of the NF-\u03baB ligand (RANKL) were investigated using RT-PCR. OPG and RANKL synthesis was measured by ELISA and ALP activity by colorimetric assay.\n\n10% of SMS led to a decrease in cell viability of both cells lines, but no increased rate of apoptosis. RT-PCR showed the highest increase of cyclin D1 expression for HPdLF and HOB when applied to 5% of SMS, and HOB showed a doubling of COL-I gene expression. HPdLF and HOB showed a strength-dependent synthesis of OPG and ALP activity, whereas HOB demonstrated a decrease in OPG synthesis and ALP activity when applied to 10% of SMS.",
        "To evaluate the relevance of ongoing nociceptive joint inputs to the maintenance of widespread pain hypersensitivity in patients with hip osteoarthritis (OA) and to determine whether a reversal in the widespread pressure hypersensitivity together with an improvement in pain and function occurs after total hip replacement in these patients.\n\nForty patients with hip OA participated. Twenty patients underwent total hip replacement, and the other 20 patients were assigned to a waiting list. Pressure-pain thresholds (PPTs) over the second metacarpal bone and the gluteus medius, vastus medialis, vastus lateralis, and tibialis anterior muscles were assessed bilaterally with a pressure algometer before and 3 months after total hip replacement surgery. Assessments of pain intensity (by visual analog scale [VAS]), physical function (by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index), and health status (by the Short Form 12 health survey and the EuroQol 5-domain index) were also performed.\n\nPatients who underwent total hip arthroplasty exhibited a reduction in widespread pressure pain hyperalgesia (increases in PPTs) over local and distant pain-free areas, as compared with before surgery and as compared with the patients assigned to the waiting list. PPTs were related to hip pain intensity, and significant correlations were found between higher VAS scores and lower average PPTs over all points assessed (-0.409 < r < -0.306, P < 0.05). Patients who underwent total hip arthroplasty exhibited a greater decrease in pain intensity and greater increases in function and health status than did those who were on the waiting list. Changes in the intensity of hip pain were moderately associated with changes in pressure pain sensitivity in the hip arthroplasty group.",

        "The failure to wean from mechanical ventilation is related to worse outcomes after cardiac surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the serum level of B-type natriuretic peptide is a predictor of weaning failure from mechanical ventilation after cardiac surgery.\n\nWe conducted a prospective, observational cohort study of 101 patients who underwent on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting. B-type natriuretic peptide was measured postoperatively after intensive care unit admission and at the end of a 60-min spontaneous breathing test. The demographic data, hemodynamic and respiratory parameters, fluid balance, need for vasopressor or inotropic support, and length of the intensive care unit and hospital stays were recorded. Weaning failure was considered as either the inability to sustain spontaneous breathing after 60 min or the need for reintubation within 48 h.\n\nOf the 101 patients studied, 12 patients failed the weaning trial. There were no differences between the groups in the baseline or intraoperative characteristics, including left ventricular function, EuroSCORE and lengths of the cardiac procedure and cardiopulmonary bypass. The B-type natriuretic peptide levels were significantly higher at intensive care unit admission and at the end of the breathing test in the patients with weaning failure compared with the patients who were successfully weaned. In a multivariate model, a high B-type natriuretic peptide level at the end of a spontaneous breathing trial was the only independent predictor of weaning failure from mechanical ventilation.",

Clinical and laboratory data were collected monthly (except if the patient received a transplant, recovered renal function, was transferred to hemodialysis, or died).\n\nSurvival analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazards. Total follow-up was 34 months. The mean age was 59 years (54% female). The weight category percentages were as follows: underweight: 8%; normal: 51%; overweight: 29%; and obese 12%. The multivariate model showed a higher risk of death for a body mass index <18.5 kg/m\u00b2, a neutral risk between 25 and 29.9 kg/m\u00b2 and a protective effect for an index >30 kg/m\u00b2.

        "Relapsed or refractory pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains a major cause of death from cancer in children. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of SAR3419, an antibody-drug conjugate of the maytansinoid DM4 and a humanized anti-CD19 antibody, against B-cell precursor (BCP)-ALL and infant mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) xenografts.\n\nALL xenografts were established as systemic disease in immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice from direct patient explants. SAR3419 was administered as a single agent and in combination with an induction-type regimen of vincristine/dexamethasone/l-asparaginase (VXL). Leukemia progression and response to treatment were assessed in real-time, and responses were evaluated using strict criteria modeled after the clinical setting.\n\nSAR3419 significantly delayed the progression of 4 of 4 CD19(+) BCP-ALL and 3 of 3 MLL-ALL xenografts, induced objective responses in all but one xenograft but was ineffective against T-lineage ALL xenografts. Relative surface CD19 expression across the xenograft panel significantly correlated with leukemia progression delay and objective response measure scores. SAR3419 also exerted significant efficacy against chemoresistant BCP-ALL xenografts over a large (10-fold) dose range and significantly enhanced VXL-induced leukemia progression delay in two highly chemoresistant xenografts by up to 82 days. When administered as protracted therapy following remission induction with VXL, SAR3419 prevented disease recurrence into hematolymphoid and other major organs with the notable exception of central nervous system involvement.",

Clinical data were extracted from a prospectively collected database and chart review. Survival between Jo-1 and non-Jo-1 was compared by log rank and Cox proportional hazards methods.\n\n202 patients possessed anti-synAb: 122 Jo-1 and 80 non-Jo-1 (35 PL-12; 25 PL-7; 9 EJ; 6 KS; 5 OJ). The diagnoses at first visit for Jo-1 and non-Jo-1 patients were myositis in 83% and 40.0%, overlap or undifferentiated CTD in 17% and 47.5%, and systemic sclerosis in 0% and 12.5%, respectively (p<0.001). The median delay in diagnosis was 0.4 years in Jo-1 patients versus 1.0 year in non-Jo-1 patients (p<0.001). The most common causes of death in the overall cohort were pulmonary fibrosis in 49% and pulmonary hypertension in 11%. The 5- and 10-year unadjusted cumulative survival was 90% and 70% for Jo-1 patients, and 75% and 47% for non-Jo-1 patients (p<0.005). The hazard ratio (HR) of non-Jo-1 patients compared with Jo-1 patients was 1.9 (p=0.01) for cumulative and 1.9 (p=0.008) for event free survival from diagnosis.

        "Hormone replacement therapy increases the risk of developing ulcerative colitis in postmenopausal women. Chronic intestinal inflammation predisposes to colon cancer development, but effects of female hormones on colitis-associated cancer development have not been examined.\n\nTo investigate the role of female hormones in the dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-azoxymethane (AOM) mouse model for colitis-associated cancer.\n\nWe performed ovariectomies, or sham operations, on mice, and supplemented these animals with indicated hormones. Additionally, we used oestrogen receptor \u03b1 or \u03b2 (Er\u03b1 or Er\u03b2) mutant mice. To study colitis or colitis-associated cancer, we used DSS only, or DSS and AOM, respectively.\n\nOvariectomy protects female mice against colitis-associated tumour development. Hormone replacement in ovariectomised mice with either oestradiol (E2), medroxyprogesterone acetate or a combination of both suggests that oestrogens are the ovary-derived factor that promotes tumour development in the context of inflammatory damage. E2-treated animals showed increased clinical symptoms and Il-6 production upon DSS-induced colitis and enhanced epithelial proliferation. Treatment with E2 markedly increased the numbers of polyps in ovariectomised mice and also strongly promoted tumour progression with all E2-treated animals developing at least one invasive adenocarcinoma, whereas, placebo-treated animals developed adenomas only. Using Er mutant mice, we find that the protumorigenic effect of oestrogen depends on both Er\u03b1 and Er\u03b2.",
        "Dietary pattern studies are traditionally the domain of epidemiological research. From a clinical perspective, there is a need to explore the effects of changing food and dietary patterns of individuals. The aim was to identify patterns of food choice in the context of a clinical weight loss trial. Cluster analysis based on reported serves of food groups revealed dietary patterns informative for the clinical setting.\n\nCluster analysis was conducted using diet history data from two clinical trials at baseline, and outcomes at 3 months were reviewed based on these clusters (n=231). The cluster solution was analysed using defined food groups in serves and with respect to clinical parameters and requirements for selected nutrients.\n\nTwo distinct dietary patterns were identified from the reported baseline dietary intakes. Subjects in Cluster 1 reported food patterns characterised by higher intakes of low-fat dairy and unsaturated oils and margarine and were generally more closely aligned to food choices encouraged in national dietary guidelines. Subjects in Cluster 2 reported a dietary pattern characterised by non-core foods and drinks, higher- and medium-fat dairy foods, fatty meats and alcohol. At 3 months, Cluster 2 subjects reported greater reductions in energy intake (-5317 kJ; P<0.001) and greater weight loss (-5.6 kg; P<0.05) compared with Cluster 1.",

Subsequently, the older subjects performed 6 months of resistance type exercise training, after which measurements were repeated. Differences in quadriceps muscle CSA were compared with differences in type I and type II muscle fiber size.\n\nQuadriceps CSA was substantially smaller in older versus young men (68 \u00b1 2 vs 80 \u00b1 2 cm(2), respectively; P<0.001). Type II muscle fiber size was substantially smaller in the elderly vs the young (29%; P<0.001), with a tendency of smaller type I muscle fibers (P=0.052). Differences in type II muscle fiber size fully explained differences in quadriceps CSA between groups. Prolonged resistance type exercise training in the elderly increased type II muscle fiber size by 24 \u00b1 8% (P<0.01), explaining 100 \u00b1 3% of the increase in quadriceps muscle CSA (from 68 \u00b1 2 to 74 \u00b1 2 cm(2)).",
        "As one of the most dominant bacterial groups on Earth, cyanobacteria play a pivotal role in the global carbon cycling and the Earth atmosphere composition. Understanding their molecular responses to environmental perturbations has important scientific and environmental values. Since important biological processes or networks are often evolutionarily conserved, the cross-species transcriptional network analysis offers a useful strategy to decipher conserved and species-specific transcriptional mechanisms that cells utilize to deal with various biotic and abiotic disturbances, and it will eventually lead to a better understanding of associated adaptation and regulatory networks.\n\nIn this study, the Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) approach was used to establish transcriptional networks for four important cyanobacteria species under metal stress, including iron depletion and high copper conditions. Cross-species network comparison led to discovery of several core response modules and genes possibly essential to metal stress, as well as species-specific hub genes for metal stresses in different cyanobacteria species, shedding light on survival strategies of cyanobacteria responding to different environmental perturbations.",
        "Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common vaginal disorder of reproductive-age women. Yet the cause of BV has not been established. To uncover key determinants of BV, we employed a multi-omic, systems-biology approach, including both deep 16S rRNA gene-based sequencing and metabolomics of lavage samples from 36 women. These women varied demographically, behaviorally, and in terms of health status and symptoms.\n\n16S rRNA gene-based community composition profiles reflected Nugent scores, but not Amsel criteria. In contrast, metabolomic profiles were markedly more concordant with Amsel criteria. Metabolomic profiles revealed two distinct symptomatic BV types (SBVI and SBVII) with similar characteristics that indicated disruption of epithelial integrity, but each type was correlated to the presence of different microbial taxa and metabolites, as well as to different host behaviors. The characteristic odor associated with BV was linked to increases in putrescine and cadaverine, which were both linked to Dialister spp. Additional correlations were seen with the presence of discharge, 2-methyl-2-hydroxybutanoic acid, and Mobiluncus spp., and with pain, diethylene glycol and Gardnerella spp.",
        "Many animals use information acquired from recent experiences to modify their responses to new situations. Animals\" decisions in contests also depend on their previous experience: after recent victories individuals tend to behave more aggressively and after defeats more submissively. Although these winner and/or loser effects have been reported for animals of different taxa, they have only recently been shown to be flexible traits, which can be influenced by extrinsic factors. In a mangrove killifish (Kryptolebias marmoratus), for instance, individuals which lost an earlier contest were more likely than others to alter contest decisions after a recent win/loss. This result suggests that individuals perceiving themselves to have worse fighting abilities are more inclined to adjust contest strategy based on new information. If this is the case, an individual\"s propensity to modify behaviour after a win/loss might also be modulated by intrinsic mechanisms related to its ability to fight. Stress and sex steroid hormones are often associated with an individual\"s contest behaviour and performance, so, in this study, we tested the hypothesis that an individual\"s propensity to change behaviour after wins or losses also depends on its hormonal state.\n\nOur results show that an individual\"s propensity to adjust contest decisions after wins and losses does depend on its hormonal state: individuals with lower levels of cortisol (F), testosterone (T) and 11-ketotestosterone (KT) are more receptive than others to the influence of recent contest experiences, especially losing experiences, and the influences last longer. Furthermore, although winning and losing experiences resulted in significant changes in behaviour, they did not bring about a significant change in the levels of F, T, KT or oestradiol (E2).",

        "This study examined if the delta-opioid (\u03b4-opioid) receptor agonist, SNC-121, can improve retinal function and retinal ganglion cell (RGC) survival during glaucomatous injury in a chronic ocular hypertensive rat model.\n\nIOP was raised in brown Norway rats by injecting hypertonic saline into the limbal venous system. Rats were treated with 1 mg/kg SNC-121 (intraperitoneally [IP]) once daily for 7 days. Pattern-electroretinograms (PERGs) were obtained in response to contrast reversal of patterned visual stimuli. RGCs were visualized by fluorogold retrograde labeling. Expression of TNF-\u03b1 and p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase was measured by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting.\n\nPERG amplitudes in ocular hypertensive eyes were significantly reduced (14.3 \u00b1 0.60 \u03bcvolts) when compared with healthy eyes (18.0 \u00b1 0.62 \u03bcvolts). PERG loss in hypertensive eyes was inhibited by SNC-121 treatment (17.20 \u00b1 0.1.3 \u03bcvolts; P < 0.05). There was a 29% loss of RGCs in the ocular hypertensive eye, which was inhibited in the presence of SNC-121. TNF-\u03b1 production and activation of p38 MAP kinase in retinal sections and optic nerve samples were upregulated in ocular hypertensive eyes and inhibited in the presence of SNC-121. Furthermore, TNF-\u03b1 induced increase in p38 MAP kinase activation in astrocytes was inhibited in the presence of SNC-121.",
        "Recent studies demonstrated that myeloid cells are associated with systemic immunosuppression in tumor-bearing hosts. In particular, myeloid cells positive for Gr-1 and CD11b in tumor-bearing mice are called myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) because of their suppression of T-cell activation. In this study, we investigated the antitumor effects of corosolic acid (CA) in murine sarcoma model.\n\nThe results from the in vivo study showed that CA administration did not suppress the tumor proliferation index, but significantly impaired subcutaneous tumor development and lung metastasis. Furthermore, CA administration inhibited signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (Stat3) activation and increased in the number of infiltrating lymphocytes in tumor tissues. Ex vivo analysis demonstrated that a significant immunosuppressive effect of MDSC in tumor-bearing mice was abrogated and the mRNA expressions of cyclooxygenase-2 and CCL2 in MDSC were significantly decreased by CA administration. Furthermore, CA enhanced the antitumor effects of adriamycin and cisplatin in in vitro.",

        "This study aimed to investigate the association between intraocular pressure and metabolic syndrome according to menopause status in nonglaucomatous Korean women.\n\nWe examined the relationship between intraocular pressure and metabolic syndrome in 4,524 nonglaucomatous Korean women (2,866 premenopausal women and 1,658 postmenopausal women) who participated in the 2008 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Multivariate linear regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between metabolic syndrome and intraocular pressure after adjusting for age, body mass index, smoking status, alcohol consumption, regular exercise, hypertension medication, and diabetes medication according to menopause status in women.\n\nThe prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 5.4% for premenopausal women and 28.0% for postmenopausal women. The mean intraocular pressure gradually increased in accordance with the increasing number of components for metabolic syndrome in postmenopausal women (P = 0.002), but not in premenopausal women (P = 0.387). In multivariate regression analysis, intraocular pressure was significantly associated with metabolic syndrome in postmenopausal women (P = 0.015) after adjusting for confounding variables, but not in premenopausal women (P = 0.940).",
        "Coronary microvascular resistance is increased after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), which may be related in part to changed left ventricular (LV) dynamics. Therefore we studied the coronary microcirculation in relation to systolic and diastolic LV function after STEMI.\n\nThe study cohort consisted of 12 consecutive patients, all treated with primary PCI for a first anterior wall STEMI. At 4\\xa0months, we assessed pressure-volume loops. Subsequently, we measured intracoronary pressure and flow velocity and calculated coronary microvascular resistance. Infarct size and LV mass were assessed using magnetic resonance imaging.\n\nPatients with an impaired systolic LV function due to a larger myocardial infarction showed a higher baseline average peak flow velocity (APV) than the other patients (26\\u2009\u00b1\\u20097 versus 17\\u2009\u00b1\\u20095\\xa0cm/s, p\\u2009=\\u20090.003, respectively), and showed an impaired variable microvascular resistance index (2.1\\u2009\u00b1\\u20091.0 versus 4.1\\u2009\u00b1\\u20091.3\\xa0mmHg\\u2009cm(-1)\u2219s(-1), p\\u2009=\\u20090.003, respectively).

        "We sought to assess whether cardiorenal anemia syndrome (CRAS) in chronic heart failure (CHF) patients contributes to sympathetic overactivity through modulation of sympathetic reflexes.\n\nWe prospectively studied 15 patients with CRAS and CHF and 15 control CHF patients, matched for age, gender distribution, type of cardiomyopathy, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and BMI. We compared muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) and the effect of peripheral chemoreflex deactivation on MSNA in both groups. We also compared sympathetic baroreflex function, assessed by the slope of the relationship between MSNA and diastolic blood pressure in both groups and while peripheral chemoreflexes were (by breathing 100% oxygen for 15 min) or not deactivated. Baseline MSNA was significantly elevated in CHF patients with CRAS compared with control CHF patients (83.1 \u00b1 4.6 versus 64.9 \u00b1 2.9 bursts/100 heart beats; P<0.05) and sympathetic baroreflex impaired (2.69 \u00b1 0.44 vs 5.25 \u00b1 0.60%bursts/mmHg; P<0.01). Chemoreflex deactivation with administration of 100% oxygen led to a significant decrease in muscle sympathetic nerve activity (77.8 \u00b1 4.7 versus 82.1 \u00b1 4.9 bursts/100 heart beats; P<0.01) and to an increase in sympathetic baroreflex function (2.77 \u00b1 0.45 vs 5.63 \u00b1 0.73%bursts/mmHg; P<0.01) in patients with CRAS and CHF.

Balance was assessed with the Berg Balance Scale, posturography, and self-reported balance confidence. Fall risk was assessed with the Physiological Profile Assessment. Cognitive processing speed was quantified with the Symbol Digit Modalities Test and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test.\n\nRecurrent fallers had slower cognitive processing speed than single-time fallers (P \u2264.01). There was no difference in mobility, balance, or fall risk between recurrent and single-time fallers (P>.05).",
        "Chronic alcohol abuse is associated with deficits in cognitive control functions. Cognitive control is likely to be mediated through the interaction between intrinsic large-scale brain networks involved in externally oriented executive functioning and internally focused thought processing. Improving the interaction between these functional brain networks could be an important target for treatment. Therefore, the current study aimed to investigate the effects of the cognitive enhancer modafinil on within-network and between-network resting-state functional connectivity and cognitive control functions in alcohol-dependent patients.\n\nIn a double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over design, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and a Stroop task were employed in alcohol-dependent patients (n = 15) and healthy control subjects (n = 16). Within-network and between-network functional connectivity was calculated using a combination of independent component analysis and functional network connectivity analysis.\n\nModafinil significantly increased the negative coupling between executive networks and the default mode network, which was associated with modafinil-induced improvement in cognitive control in alcohol-dependent patients.",
        "Parental eating behavior traits have been shown to be related to the adiposity of their young children. It is unknown whether this relationship persists in older offspring or whether rigid or flexible control are involved. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that parental eating behavior traits, as measured by the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ), are related to offspring body weight.\n\nCross-sectional anthropometric and TFEQ data from phase 2 and 3 of the Qu\u00e9bec Family Study generated 192 parent-offspring dyads (offspring age range: 10-37 years). Relationships were adjusted for offspring age, sex and reported physical activity, number of offspring per family and parent body mass index (BMI).\n\nIn all parent-offspring dyads, parental rigid control and disinhibition scores were positively related to offspring BMI (r=0.17, P=0.02; r=0.18, P<0.01, respectively). There were no significant relationships between cognitive restraint (P=0.75) or flexible control (P=0.06) with offspring BMI. Regression models revealed that parent disinhibition mediated the relationship between parent and offspring BMI, whereas rigid control of the parent moderated this relationship. The interaction effect between parental rigid control and disinhibition was a significant predictor of offspring BMI (\u03b2=0.13, P=0.05).",
        "To examine the effects of sucrose on pain and biochemical markers of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) degradation and oxidative stress in preterm neonates experiencing a clinically required heel lance.\n\nPreterm neonates that met study criteria (n = 131) were randomized into 3 groups: (1) control; (2) heel lance treated with placebo and non-nutritive sucking; and (3) heel lance treated with sucrose and non-nutritive sucking. Plasma markers of ATP degradation (hypoxanthine, xanthine, and uric acid) and oxidative stress (allantoin) were measured before and after the heel lance. Pain was measured with the Premature Infant Pain Profile. Data were analyzed by the use of repeated-measures ANOVA and Spearman rho.\n\nWe found significant increases in plasma hypoxanthine and uric acid over time in neonates who received sucrose. We also found a significant negative correlation between pain scores and plasma allantoin concentration in a subgroup of neonates who received sucrose.",

Outcome variables included dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry measurements of body composition, assessments of neuromuscular function, and levels of physical activity (steps/day) measured by accelerometry.\n\nPhysical activity was lower in girls than boys at T2 and T3, but there was no sex difference at T1. Physical activity increased with Tanner stage for boys but did not differ between Tanner stages in girls. Physical activity at each Tanner stage was strongly associated (R(2) > 0.85) with neuromuscular characteristics for both boys and girls, but percentage of body fat also was associated with physical activity for T3 girls.",
        "Renal ischaemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is a systemic inflammatory process in which Th1 responses predominate affecting other organs including the lungs. The present study explored the phagocytic and microbicidal capacity of macrophages in rats with lung inflammation that underwent IRI.\n\nThe alveolar macrophages of rats sensitised to OVA were evaluated for phagocytosis and bacterial killing 24h after antigen challenge in animals with or without prior submission to 60 min of renal ischaemia.\n\nBronchoalveolar lavage had a high level of cellular infiltrate in immunised animals (420%) compared with control animals; IRI significantly reduced this infiltration (52%). Macrophages from animals immunised and challenged with OVA presented a 10x increase in phagocytic capacity compared to the control group, whereas immunised animals subjected to IRI showed a reduction in the phagocytic index of 68%. The killing of Klebsiella pneumoniae by macrophages from immunised animals was higher (56%) compared with the control group but reduced in animals submitted to IRI (45%).

        "To quantify set-up uncertainties during voluntary deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) radiotherapy using 3D-surface imaging in patients with left sided breast cancer.\n\nNineteen patients were included. Cone-beam CT-scan (CBCT) was used for online set-up correction while patients were instructed to perform a voluntary DIBH. The reproducibility of the DIBH during treatment was monitored with 2D-fluoroscopy and portal imaging. Simultaneously, a surface imaging system was used to capture 3D-surfaces throughout CBCT acquisition and delivery of treatment beams. Retrospectively, all captured surfaces were registered to the planning-CT surface. Interfraction, intra-fraction and intra-beam set-up variability were quantified in left-right, cranio-caudal and anterior-posterior direction.\n\nInter-fraction systematic (\u03a3) and random (\u03c3) translational errors (1SD) before and after set-up correction were between 0.20-0.50 cm and 0.09-0.22 cm, respectively, whereas rotational \u03a3 and \u03c3 errors were between 0.08 and 1.56\u00b0.

        "A decreased sensitivity to 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP) has been shown to be associated with increased energy intake and therefore an increased body mass index, although other studies have not confirmed this association, suggesting the involvement of other factors. We investigated whether the endocannabinoid system, which also modulates hunger/satiety and energy balance, plays a role in modulating eating behavior influenced by a sensitivity to PROP.\n\nThe plasma profile of the endocannabinoids 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), anandamide (AEA), and congeners of AEA, palmitoylethanolamide and oleylethanolamide (OEA), was determined in normal-weight PROP supertasters (STs) and PROP non-tasters (NTs). A cognitive eating behavior disorder was assessed by the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire, which estimates dietary restraint, disinhibition, and perceived hunger.\n\nThe disinhibition score of NTs was higher than those of STs (P\\xa0=\\xa00.02). Moreover, in NTs, OEA was inversely correlated to the perceived hunger score (r\\xa0=\\xa0-0.7, P\\xa0=\\xa00.002), and AEA was positively correlated to the restraint score (r\\xa0=\\xa00.5, P\\xa0=\\xa00.04) and negatively to the perceived hunger score, although the latter correlation was at the limit of statistical significance (r\\xa0=\\xa0-0.47, P\\xa0=\\xa00.05).

        "Idiopathic portal hypertension (IPH) is a rare cause of portal hypertension that lacks a specific diagnostic test. Requiring ruling-out other causes of portal hypertension it is frequently misdiagnosed. This study evaluates whether using high-throughput techniques there is a metabolomic profile allowing a noninvasive diagnosis of IPH.\n\nThirty-three IPH patients were included. Matched patients with cirrhosis (CH) and healthy volunteers (HV) were included as controls. Metabolomic analysis of plasma samples was performed using UPLC-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry. We computed Student\"s P-values, corrected by multiple comparison and VIP score (Variable Importance in the Projection). The metabolites were selected with an adjusted Benjamini Hochberg P value <0.05. We use markers with a greater VIP score, to build partial least squares projection to latent structures regression with discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) representative models to discriminate IPH from CH and from HV. The performance of the PLS-DA model was evaluated using R(2) and Q(2) parameter. An additional internal cross-validation was done.\n\nPLS-DA analysis showed a clear separation of IPH from CH with a model involving 28 metabolites (Q(2)=0.67, area under the curve (AUC)=0.99) and a clear separation of IPH from healthy subjects with a model including 31 metabolites (Q(2)=0.75, AUC=0.98). After cross-validation, both models showed high rates of sensitivity (94.8 and 97.5), specificity (89.1 and 89.7), and AUC (0.98 and 0.98), reinforcing the strength of our findings.",

The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether a multi-institutional effort to reduce blood product use affects postoperative events after cardiac surgical operations and to determine the influence of perioperative transfusion on risk-adjusted outcomes.\n\nA total of 14,259 patients (2006-2010) undergoing nonemergency, primary, isolated coronary artery bypass grafting operations at 17 different statewide cardiac centers were stratified according to transfusion guideline era: pre-guideline (n = 7059, age = 63.7 \u00b1 10.6 years) versus post-guideline (n = 7200, age = 63.7 \u00b1 10.5 years). Primary outcomes of interest were observed differences in postoperative events and mortality risk-adjusted associations as estimated by multiple regression analysis.\n\nOverall intraoperative (24% vs 18%, P < .001) and postoperative (39% vs 33%, P < .001) blood product transfusion were significantly reduced in the post-guideline era. Patients in the post-guideline era demonstrated reduced morbidity with decreased pneumonia (P = .01), prolonged ventilation (P = .05), renal failure (P = .03), new-onset hemodialysis (P = .004), and composite incidence of major complications (P = .001). Operative mortality (1.0% vs 1.8%, P < .001) and postoperative ventilation time (22 vs 26 hours, P < .001) were similarly reduced in the post-guideline era. Of note, after mortality risk adjustment, operations performed in the post-guideline era were associated with a 47% reduction in the odds of death (adjusted odds ratio, 0.57; P < .001), whereas the risk of major complications and mortality were significantly increased after intraoperative (adjusted odds ratio, 1.86 and 1.25; both P < .001) and postoperative (adjusted odds ratio, 4.61 and 4.50, both P < .001) transfusion.

HIV risk behaviors and measures of substance and psychosocial HIV risk factors in the past month were obtained. Non-Hispanic Blacks engaged in less HIV sexual risk behaviors overall than non-Hispanic Whites. While non-Hispanic Whites were the most likely to report any injection drug use, Hispanics engaged in the most HIV drug risk behaviors. Specific risk factors were differentially predictive of HIV risk behavior by race/ethnicity. Alcohol use severity was related to engaging in higher sex risk behaviors for non-Hispanic Blacks and Whites. Greater psychiatric severity was related to engaging in higher sex risk behaviors for non-Hispanic Whites. Drug use severity was associated with engaging in higher risk drug behaviors for non-Hispanic Whites and Hispanics with the magnitude of the relationship stronger for Hispanics.",

This study evaluated the impact of age on treatment outcomes in cocaine abusing methadone patients.\n\nData were analyzed from 189 patients enrolled in one of three randomized studies that evaluated the efficacy of CM versus standard care (SC) treatment.\n\nAge was associated with some demographics and drug use characteristics including racial composition, education, and methadone dose. Primary drug abuse treatment outcomes did not vary across age groups, but CM had a greater benefit for engendering longer durations of abstinence in the middle/older and older age groups compared to the younger age groups. At the 6-month follow-up, submission of a cocaine positive urine sample was predicted by submission of a cocaine positive sample at intake, higher methadone doses, and assignment to SC rather than CM treatment.",
        "Patients with prevalent or incident tuberculosis (TB) in antiretroviral treatment (ART) programmes in sub-Saharan Africa have high mortality risk. However, published data are contradictory as to whether TB is a risk factor for mortality that is independent of CD4 cell counts and other patient characteristics.\n\nThis observational ART cohort study was based in Cape Town, South Africa. Deaths from all causes were ascertained among patients receiving ART for up to 8 years. TB diagnoses and 4-monthly CD4 cell counts were recorded. Mortality rates were calculated and Poisson regression models were used to calculate incidence rate ratios (IRR) and identify risk factors for mortality. Of 1544 patients starting ART, 464 patients had prevalent TB at baseline and 424 developed incident TB during a median of 5.0 years follow-up. Most TB diagnoses (73.6%) were culture-confirmed. A total of 208 (13.5%) patients died during ART and mortality rates were 8.84 deaths/100 person-years during the first year of ART and decreased to 1.14 deaths/100 person-years after 5 years. In multivariate analyses adjusted for baseline and time-updated risk factors, both prevalent and incident TB were independent risk factors for mortality (IRR 1.7 [95% CI, 1.2-2.3] and 2.7 [95% CI, 1.9-3.8], respectively). Adjusted mortality risks were higher in the first 6 months of ART for those with prevalent TB at baseline (IRR 2.33; 95% CI, 1.5-3.5) and within the 6 months following diagnoses of incident TB (IRR 3.8; 95% CI, 2.6-5.7).",
        "To characterize the clinical features and biochemical status at presentation of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in different age groups of children, and to analyze the outcomes of a certain treatment protocol.\n\nWe reviewed records of patients with DKA who were admitted to our hospital between January 2007 and December 2010. Patients were divided into three subgroups according to age, and the results were compared between these groups.\n\nOne hundred thirty-four episodes in 111 patients (64 females, 47 males) were analyzed. Of these 134 episodes, 60% was in patients with new-onset diabetes and 40% was in those with established diabetes. Patients younger than 5 years had lower C-peptide and HbA1c levels than older patients at clinical onset. They were also given more alkali therapy. The initial conscious level was found closely related to plasma osmolality and serum sodium levels. Seven of 11 patients with recurrent DKA were females. No major complication was observed.",
        "The ferroxidase center of DNA-binding protein from starved cells (Dps) is a major player in the iron oxidation/detoxification process that leads to a decreased reactive oxygen species production. The possible Mn(II) participation in this process has been studied in Dps from Kineococcus radiotolerans, a radiation-resistant bacterium with a high cytosolic Mn/Fe ratio and a high capacity to survive ionizing and stress conditions.\n\nThe X-ray structure of recombinant K. radiotolerans Dps loaded with Mn(II) has been solved at 2.0\u00c5 resolution. Mn(II) binding to K. radiotolerans Dps and its effect on Fe(II) oxidation have been characterized in spectroscopic measurements.\n\nIn K. radiotolerans Dps, the Fe-Fe ferroxidase center can have a Mn-Fe composition. Mn(II) binds only at the high affinity, so-called A site, whereas Fe(II) binds also at the low affinity, so-called B site. The Mn-Fe and Fe-Fe centers behave distinctly upon iron oxidation by O2. A site-bound Mn(II) or Fe(II) plays a catalytic role, while B site-bound Fe(II) behaves like a substrate and can be replaced by another Fe(II) after oxidation. When H2O2 is the Fe(II) oxidant, single electrons are transferred to aromatic residues near the ferroxidase center and give rise to intra-protein radicals thereby limiting OH release in solution. The presence of the Mn-Fe center results in significant differences in the development of such intra-protein radicals.",
        "Increased expression of aggrecanase-1 (ADAMTS-4) has emerged as an important factor in osteoarthritis (OA) and other joint diseases. This study aimed to determine whether the expression of ADAMTS-4 in human chondrocytes is regulated by miRNA.\n\nMiRNA targets were identified using bioinformatics. Chondrocytes were isolated from knee cartilage and treated with interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2). Gene expression was quantified using TaqMan assays and protein production was determined by immunoblotting. Luciferase reporter assay was used to verify interaction between miRNA and target messenger RNA (mRNA).\n\nIn silico analysis predicted putative target sequence of miR-125b on ADAMTS-4. MiR-125b was expressed in both normal and OA chondrocytes, with significantly lower expression in OA chondrocytes than in normal chondrocytes. Furthermore, IL-1\u03b2-induced upregulation of ADAMTS-4 was suppressed by overexpression of miR-125b in human OA chondrocytes. In the luciferase reporter assay, mutation of the putative miR-125b binding site in the ADAMTS-4 3\"UTR abrogated the suppressive effect of miR125.",

Primary follicle proportion was reduced in animals exposed during pregnancy. No significant changes were detected in uterine morphology.",
        "Earlier studies have demonstrated an association between N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) catalytic activity and the genotype of a recently published tag single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs1495741. There have been no reports on the relationship between the rs1495741 genotype and antituberculosis drug-induced hepatotoxicity (ATDIH) to date.\n\nThe aim of the present study was to determine the frequency of the NAT2 tag SNP (rs1495741) in the Taiwanese and its relation to the incidence of ATDIH.\n\nA total of 348 tuberculosis patients were enrolled to determine the frequency of NAT2 tag SNP rs1495741 and its relation to the incidence of ATDIH. The conventional NAT2 variants alleles have also been investigated. Furthermore, to evaluate the correlation of NAT2 activity and rs1495741 genotypes, a pharmacokinetic study of isoniazid was also conducted in healthy volunteers.\n\nAmong the 348 tuberculosis patients, 20 (5.7%) were diagnosed with ATDIH. The frequencies of the three rs1495741 genotypes, viz., AA, AG, and GG, were 24.7, 52.3, and 23.0%, respectively. Signi&filig;cant differences among rs1495741 genotypes and susceptibility to hepatotoxicity were noted (odds ratio=14.068, P<0.05). Moreover, the rs1495741 genotypes showed an association with the isoniazid dosage required for induction of hepatotoxicity. In the pharmacokinetic study, NAT2 activity was strongly associated with genotype categories (P<0.001).",
        "The objective was to see if hyperglycemia in the emergency department predicted traumatic intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) for infants and young children.\n\nA 6-year retrospective chart review was performed on patients younger than 3 years. Patients identified from the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) database with ICH on computer tomography were compared with those with a history of trauma without ICH identified from a radiology database. Subgroup analysis was performed on the ICH group comparing abusive head trauma (AHT) and accidental. Primary outcomes measured were initial serum glucose level, length of stay, length of ventilation, mortality, and disability on discharge.\n\nFifty-three patients were admitted to the PICU with traumatic ICH with an overall mortality of 7.5%. The average initial glucose in the emergency department was significantly higher for the patients with ICH than those without (164 vs. 99 mg/dL, P < 0.0001). Combining elevated serum glucose with any abnormality in Glasgow Coma Scale score yielded sensitivity and specificity of 100%. The average presenting glucose was higher for AHT compared with accidental injury (190 vs. 133 mg/dL, P < 0.001). Patients with AHT had greater PICU and hospital length of stay and more severe disabilities on discharge (P < 0.001).",
        "Intra-articular distal humeral fractures can be approached in a variety of ways. The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the functional outcomes of two approaches: approach with olecranon osteotomy and triceps-lifting approach for the treatment of intra-articular distal humeral fractures.\n\nThis study shows a consecutive series of 54 intra-articular distal humeral fractures of 54 patients who were treated with open reduction and internal fixation with anatomic plating. Lateral plating was performed in 10 (45.5 %) patients, and medial and lateral parallel plating was performed in 12 (54.5 %) patients in olecranon osteotomy group, while lateral plating was performed in 8 (25 %) patients, and medial and lateral parallel plating was performed in 24 (75 %) patients in triceps-lifting group.\n\nMean follow-up was 38.3 months for olecranon osteotomy group and 41.4 months for triceps-lifting group. Functional outcomes according to MAYO elbow score and extension-flexion motion arc values were significantly better in olecranon osteotomy group (p < 0.05).",
        "Phosphatase of regenerating liver-3 (PRL-3), a protein tyrosine phosphatase, is highly expressed in multiple human cancers and strongly implicated in tumor progression and cancer metastasis. However, the mechanisms by which PRL-3 promotes cancer cell migration, invasion, and metastasis are not very well understood. In this study, we investigated the contribution and molecular mechanisms of PRL-3 in ovarian cancer progression.\n\nPRL-3 protein expression was detected on ovarian cancer tissue microarrays using immunohistochemistry. Stable PRL-3 depleted cell lines were generated using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs. The migration and invasion potential of these cells were analyzed using Transwell and Matrigel assays, respectively. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence were used to detect protein levels and distribution in PRL-3-ablated cells and the control cells. Cell morphology was observed with hematoxylin-eosin staining and transmission electron microscopy. Finally, PRL-3-ablated and control cells were injected into nude mice for xenograft tumorigenicity assays.\n\nElevated PRL-3 expression was detected in 19% (26 out of 135) of human ovarian cancer patient samples, but not in normal ovary tissues (0 out of 14). Stable depletion of PRL-3 in A2780 ovarian cancer cells resulted in decreased migration ability and invasion activity compared with control parental A2780 cells. In addition, PRL-3-ablated cells also exhibited flattened morphology and extended lamellipodia. To address the possible molecular basis for the altered phenotypes associated with PRL-3 down-regulation, we assessed the expression profiles of various proteins involved in cell-matrix adhesion. Depletion of PRL-3 dramatically enhanced both RNA and protein levels of the cell surface receptor integrin \u03b12, but not its heterologous binding partner integrin \u03b21. Inhibition of PRL-3 also correlated with elevated expression and phosphorylation of paxillin. A pronounced increase in the expression and activation of c-fos, a transcriptional activator of integrin \u03b12, was observed in these PRL-3 knock-down cells. Moreover, forced expression of EGFP-PRL-3 resulted in the suppression of both integrin \u03b12 and c-fos expression in A2780 cells. Significantly, using a xenograft tumor model, we observed a greatly reduced tumorigenicity of A2780 PRL-3 knock-down cells in vivo.",
        "Glioblastomas are the commonest primary brain tumour and are considered one of the most heterogeneous tumour types. The introduction of a glioblastoma with oligodendroglial component (GBM + O) in the latest WHO Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System (1) was to help with this. There has been conflicting evidence as to whether this tumour conferred a better prognosis than classical glioblastoma (GBM). The aim of this study was to study the clinical phenotype of these GBM + O tumours and compare it to the classical GBM.\n\nAll patients with histological evidence of a glioblastoma between 1st January 2007 and 31st January 2011 were identified from the Neuropathology Database. Clinical and radiological details were obtained for all patients. The overall survival of patients who were treated with chemoradiotherapy was obtained and the GBM + O cohort compared to the classical GBM cohort.\n\nThree hundred and ninety-six patients with newly diagnosed glioblastomas were identified: 294 (74.2%) had classical GBM and 102 (25.6%) had GBM + O. The two cohorts presented at a similar age (61.1 years GBM + O vs. 63.2 years GBM; P = 0.09) and were matched for sex and side of the tumour. GBM + O were more likely to be located in the frontal lobes (38.2% for GBM + O vs. 27.2% for GBM: P = 0.04). In the group that was treated with chemoradiotherapy the overall survival was similar (median survival GBM + O 361 days vs. 379 days GBM; Log Rank 0.61, P = 0.43).",
        "Prostacyclin analogues are the most effective drugs to treat sclerodermic digital ulcers, but their systemic use is limited by their frequent side effects. The authors tested whether the prostacyclin analogues treprostinil and iloprost, delivered by cutaneous iontophoresis, induce sustained vasodilatation.\n\nTwenty healthy volunteers received treprostinil by cathodal iontophoresis on the forearm. Skin blood flux was quantified using laser Doppler imaging.\n\nTreprostinil 250 \u00b5M induced an increase in cutaneous vascular conductance AUC(80) (min) (31 897 \u00b1 24 390 %BL\u00b7min) compared with NaCl 0.9% (P < .005), treprostinil 2.5 \u00b5M (P < .005), and treprostinil 25 \u00b5M (P < .005). This was confirmed when flux was recorded for up to 10 hours. Systemic and skin tolerance of treprostinil were good. Iloprost was stopped early because of local toxicity.",
        "Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) is a phenotype cluster predisposing to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. We conducted a study to elucidate the genetic basis underlying linkage signals for multiple representative traits of MetS that we had previously identified at two significant QTLs on chromosomes 3q27 and 17p12.\n\nWe performed QTL-specific genomic and transcriptomic analyses in 1,137 individuals from 85 extended families that contributed to the original linkage. We tested in SOLAR association of MetS phenotypes with QTL-specific haplotype-tagging SNPs as well as transcriptional profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).\n\nSNPs significantly associated with MetS phenotypes under the prior hypothesis of linkage mapped to seven genes at 3q27 and seven at 17p12. Prioritization based on biologic relevance, SNP association, and expression analyses identified two genes: insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2) at 3q27 and tumor necrosis factor receptor 13B (TNFRSF13B) at 17p12. Prioritized genes could influence cell-cell adhesion and adipocyte differentiation, insulin/glucose responsiveness, cytokine effectiveness, plasma lipid levels, and lipoprotein densities.",

        "Individuals with deficiencies of pulmonary surfactant protein C (SP-C) develop interstitial lung disease (ILD) that is exacerbated by viral infections including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). SP-C gene targeted mice (Sftpc -/-) lack SP-C, develop an ILD-like disease and are susceptible to infection with RSV.\n\nIn order to determine requirements for correction of RSV induced injury we have generated compound transgenic mice where SP-C expression can be induced on the Sftpc -/- background (SP-C/Sftpc -/-) by the administration of doxycycline (dox). The pattern of induced SP-C expression was determined by immunohistochemistry and processing by Western blot analysis. Tissue and cellular inflammation was measured following RSV infection and the RSV-induced cytokine response of isolated Sftpc +/+ and -/- type II cells determined.\n\nAfter 5\\u2009days of dox administration transgene SP-C mRNA expression was detected by RT-PCR in the lungs of two independent lines of bitransgenic SP-C/Sftpc -/- mice (lines 55.3 and 54.2). ProSP-C was expressed in the lung, and mature SP-C was detected by Western blot analysis of the lavage fluid from both lines of SP-C/Sftpc -/- mice. Induced SP-C expression was localized to alveolar type II cells by immunostaining with an antibody to proSP-C. Line 55.3 SP-C/Sftpc -/- mice were maintained on or off dox for 7\\u2009days and infected with 2.6x107 RSV pfu.

This study aims to correlate maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) with the Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) severity score and associate VO2max with mortality in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis.\n\nThis prospective study included 27 patients who had a diagnosis of alcoholic liver cirrhosis. All subjects were followed for 3 years and performed an exercise test to determine VO2max.\n\nThe study included 18 men and 9 women. We observed a strong inverse correlation between VO2max and MELD (r=-0.91, p<0.001). In a survival analysis, individuals who had a VO2max less than 14mL/kg showed 60% mortality when compared with those who had a VO2max greater than 14mL/kg (p<0.0001; OR: 3.29; 95% CI: 1.44-5.25).",
        "Intake of green tea may reduce the risk of breast cancer; polyphenols in this drink can influence enzymes that metabolize estrogens, known causal factors in breast cancer etiology.\n\nWe examined the associations of green tea intake (<1 time/week, 1-6 times weekly, or 7+ times weekly) with urinary estrogens and estrogen metabolites (jointly EM) in a cross-sectional sample of healthy Japanese American women, including 119 premenopausal women in luteal phase and 72 postmenopausal women. We fit robust regression models to each log-transformed EM concentration (picomoles per mg creatinine), adjusting for age and study center. In premenopausal women, intake of green tea was associated with lower luteal total EM (P trend=0.01) and lower urinary 16-pathway EM (P trend=0.01). In postmenopausal women, urinary estrone and estradiol were approximately 20% and 40% lower (P trend=0.01 and 0.05, respectively) in women drinking green tea daily compared to those drinking<1 time/week. Adjustment for potential confounders (age at menarche, parity/age at first birth, body mass index, Asian birthplace, soy) did not change these associations.",
        "Exposure to high-calorie foods may promote overeating by stimulating brain reward pathways and appetite. Abdominal fat has particularly adverse metabolic consequences and may alter brain pathways that regulate feeding behavior. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to test the hypothesis that high-calorie food cues activate brain reward regions and increase appetite, and to examine the relationship between abdominal fat and brain reward responsiveness in Hispanic women.\n\nfMRI was performed while 13 volunteers viewed 12 blocks of pictures of food and non-food items. Participants rated hunger and food desire after each block of pictures. Brain activation to high-calorie foods was determined by calculating a contrast of high-calorie food minus non-food images. Pearson\"s correlations were used to test the relationship between brain reward activation and waist circumference.\n\nHigh-calorie food images activated brain reward regions (Z > 2.3, P < 0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons) and increased hunger (P = 0.001), desire for sweet (P = 0.012) and savory (P = 0.009) foods.

In this study, a cohort of 1251 patients with manifest vascular disease was included. Subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue thickness (SAT and VAT respectively) were measured ultrasonographically. IP-10 and HGF concentrations were measured with Luminex multiplex immuno assay in addition to fasting metabolic parameters. Linear regression analyses with adjustments for age, gender, smoking, estimated glomerular filtration rate, type 2 diabetes mellitus and medication use were applied to quantify the relations between adiposity or metabolic syndrome and IP-10 and HGF concentrations.\n\nVAT was significantly associated with (log)IP-10 and (log)HGF, reflected by significant higher \u03b2-values in VAT quartile 4 compared with VAT quartile 1 (reference): \u03b20.155 (95%CI:0.073-0.237) for IP-10 and \u03b20.147 (95%CI:0.076-0.218) for HGF.

        "Members of the Anopheles punctulatus group (AP group) are the primary vectors of human malaria in Papua New Guinea. The AP group includes 13 sibling species, most of them morphologically indistinguishable. Understanding why only certain species are able to transmit malaria requires a better comprehension of their evolutionary history. In particular, understanding relationships and divergence times among Anopheles species may enable assessing how malaria-related traits (e.g. blood feeding behaviours, vector competence) have evolved.\n\nDNA sequences of 14 mitochondrial (mt) genomes from five AP sibling species and two species of the Anopheles dirus complex of Southeast Asia were sequenced. DNA sequences from all concatenated protein coding genes (10,770 bp) were then analysed using a Bayesian approach to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships and date the divergence of the AP sibling species.\n\nPhylogenetic reconstruction using the concatenated DNA sequence of all mitochondrial protein coding genes indicates that the ancestors of the AP group arrived in Papua New Guinea 25 to 54 million years ago and rapidly diverged to form the current sibling species.",

Clinical and biological factors were statistically analyzed to determine the correlation between TD and this patient population.\n\nThe incidence of TD WAS 12.5% in CHC patients. Clinical hypothyroidism (5.8%) and subclinical hypothyroidism (3.8%) were more frequent than clinical hyperthyroidism (1.6%) and subclinical hyperthyroidism (1.3%). The percentage of TA-positive patients was significantly higher in people 60 years than in those 60 years (31.9 VS 18.6%; P=0.042).

        "Retinal ganglion cells atrophy during the execution of the intrinsic apoptotic program. This process, which has been termed the apoptotic volume decrease (AVD) in other cell types, has not been well-characterized in ganglion cells.\n\nAcute optic nerve crush was used to examine neuronal atrophy in the ganglion cell layer in wild-type and Bax-deficient mice. Nuclear size was measured from retinal wholemounts. Heterochromatin formation was assessed using transmission electron microscopy, whereas histone H4 acetylation was monitored using immunofluoresence. Ganglion cell and retinal transcript abundance was measured using quantitative PCR.\n\nNuclear and soma sizes linearly correlated in both control and damaged retinas. Cells in wild-type mice exhibited nuclear atrophy within 1 day after optic nerve damage. Three days after crush, nuclear atrophy was restricted to ganglion cells identified by retrograde labeling, while amacrine cells also exhibited some atrophy by 5 days. Similar kinetics of nuclear atrophy were observed in cells deficient for the essential proapoptotic gene Bax. Bax-deficient cells also exhibited other nuclear changes common in wild-type cells, including the deacetylation of histones, formation of heterochromatin, and the silencing of ganglion cell-specific gene expression.",
        "Cordycepin plays an important role in modulating the function of central nervous system (CNS). However, the modulating mechanism is poorly understood. Excitatory synaptic transmission, the essential process in brain physiology and pathology, is critical in the signal integration activities of the CNS. To further understand the effects of cordycepin on CNS, we investigated the effects of cordycepin on excitatory synaptic transmission in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices.\n\nThe effects of cordycepin on excitatory synaptic transmission were investigated by using in vitro field potential electrophysiology and whole-cell patch clamp techniques.\n\nCordycepin significantly decreased the amplitudes of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) elicited in the CA1 by stimulation of the Schaffer-commissural fibers. And the reduction in fEPSPs amplitude was associated with an increase in the paired-pulse facilitation. Cordycepin also suppressed \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor-mediated responses but did not directly affect AMPA receptors and NMDA receptors. Furthermore, quantal analysis revealed that cordycepin decreased the frequency but not amplitude of miniature spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents.",
        "A recent, cross-sectional analysis of adults found that the hip circumference divided by height(1.5) minus 18 (the body adiposity index, BAI) was strongly correlated (r = 0.79) with percent body fat determined by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. The BAI was proposed as a more accurate index of body fatness than BMI. We examined whether BAI was more strongly related, than was BMI and waist circumference, to skinfold thicknesses and levels of various risk factors for coronary heart disease.\n\nCross-sectional analyses of adults (n = 14,263 for skinfold thickness; n=6291 for fasting lipid levels) in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III, 1988-1994.\n\nAs compared with BMI and waist circumference, we found that BAI was less strongly associated with the skinfold sum and with risk factor levels. For example, correlations with the skinfold sum were r = 0.79 (BMI) vs. r = 0.70 (BAI) among men, and r = 0.86 (BMI) vs. r = 0.79 (BAI) among women; p < 0.001 for the difference between each pair of correlations. An overall index of the 7 risk factors was also more strongly associated with BMI and waist circumference than BAI in analyses stratified by sex, race-ethnicity and age. Multivariable analyses indicated that if BMI was known, BAI provided little additional information on risk factor levels.",
        "Apamin-sensitive K currents (I(KAS)) are upregulated in heart failure. We hypothesize that apamin can flatten action potential duration restitution (APDR) curve and can reduce ventricular fibrillation duration in failing ventricles.\n\nWe simultaneously mapped membrane potential and intracellular Ca (Ca(i)) in 7 rabbit hearts with pacing-induced heart failure and in 7 normal hearts. A dynamic pacing protocol was used to determine APDR at baseline and after apamin (100 nmol/L) infusion. Apamin did not change APD(80) in normal ventricles, but prolonged APD(80) in failing ventricles at either long (\u2265300 ms) or short (\u2264170 ms) pacing cycle length, but not at intermediate pacing cycle length. The maximal slope of APDR curve was 2.03 (95% confidence interval, 1.73-2.32) in failing ventricles and 1.26 (95% confidence interval, 1.13-1.40) in normal ventricles at baseline (P=0.002). After apamin administration, the maximal slope of APDR in failing ventricles decreased to 1.43 (95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.84; P=0.018), whereas no significant changes were observed in normal ventricles. During ventricular fibrillation in failing ventricles, the number of phase singularities (baseline versus apamin, 4.0 versus 2.5), dominant frequency (13.0 versus 10.0 Hz), and ventricular fibrillation duration (160 versus 80 s) were all significantly (P<0.05) decreased by apamin.",
        "Loss-of-function mutations in Na(v)1.5 cause sodium channelopathies, including Brugada syndrome, dilated cardiomyopathy, and sick sinus syndrome; however, no effective therapy exists. MOG1 increases plasma membrane (PM) expression of Na(v)1.5 and sodium current (I(Na)) density, thus we hypothesize that MOG1 can serve as a therapeutic target for sodium channelopathies.\n\nKnockdown of MOG1 expression using small interfering RNAs reduced Na(v)1.5 PM expression, decreased I(Na) densities by 2-fold in HEK/Na(v)1.5 cells and nearly abolished I(Na) in mouse cardiomyocytes. MOG1 did not affect Na(v)1.5 PM turnover. MOG1 small interfering RNAs caused retention of Na(v)1.5 in endoplasmic reticulum, disrupted the distribution of Na(v)1.5 into caveolin-3-enriched microdomains, and led to redistribution of Na(v)1.5 to noncaveolin-rich domains. MOG1 fully rescued the reduced PM expression and I(Na) densities by Na(v)1.5 trafficking-defective mutation D1275N associated with sick sinus syndrome/dilated cardiomyopathy/atrial arrhythmias. For Brugada syndrome mutation G1743R, MOG1 restored the impaired PM expression of the mutant protein and restored I(Na) in a heterozygous state (mixture of wild type and mutant Na(v)1.5) to a full level of a homozygous wild-type state.",
        "After intramyocardial injection, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) may engraft and influence host myocardium. However, engraftment rate and pattern of distribution are difficult to control in vivo, hampering assessment of potential adverse effects. In this study, the role of the engraftment patterns of MSCs on arrhythmicity in controllable in vitro models is investigated.\n\nCocultures of 4\u00d710(5) neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and 7% or 28% adult human MSCs (hMSCs) in diffuse or clustered distribution patterns were prepared. Electrophysiological effects were studied by optical mapping and patch-clamping. In diffuse cocultures, hMSCs dose-dependently decreased neonatal rat cardiomyocyte excitability, slowed conduction, and prolonged action potential duration until 90% repolarization (APD90). Triggered activity (14% versus 0% in controls) and increased inducibility of re-entry (53% versus 6% in controls) were observed in 28% hMSC cocultures. MSC clusters increased APD90, slowed conduction locally, and increased re-entry inducibility (23%), without increasing triggered activity. Pharmacological heterocellular electric uncoupling increased excitability and conduction velocity to 133% in 28% hMSC cocultures, but did not alter APD90. Transwell experiments showed that hMSCs dose-dependently increased APD90, APD dispersion, inducibility of re-entry and affected specific ion channel protein levels, whereas excitability was unaltered. Incubation with hMSC-derived exosomes did not increase APD in neonatal rat cardiomyocyte cultures.",
        "Oral supplementation with probiotic bacteria can protect against the development of allergic and inflammatory diseases.\n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate potential immunomodulatory and allergy-protective effects of processed Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG)-derived supernatants early in life in neonatal mice.\n\nIn vitro, RAW264.7 mouse macrophages were stimulated with viable LGG, LGG-derived supernatants, prepared from different growth phases, and different size fractions thereof, and pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine production was analysed. Supernatant fractions were also treated with protease, DNAse or carbohydrate-digesting enzymes to define the nature of immunomodulatory components. In vivo, neonatal Balb/c mice were orally supplemented with differentially processed LGG supernatants. Starting at 4 weeks of age, a protocol of ovalbumin-induced acute allergic airway inflammation was applied and protective effects of processed LGG supernatants were assessed.\n\nIncubation of RAW264.7 cells with LGG-derived supernatants significantly increased TNF\u03b1 and IL-10 production. These effects were not restricted to a particular molecular size fraction. Treatment with protease, but not with DNAse or carbohydrate-digesting enzymes, completely abolished the immunomodulatory activities. Incubation of TLR/NOD-transfected cells with LGG-derived supernatants revealed that recognition and signalling of bioactive components is mediated by TLR2 and NOD2. In vivo supplementation of newborn mice with processed LGG-derived supernatants resulted in pronounced protective effects on the allergic inflammatory response as reflected by reduced eosinophil numbers, modified T helper cell cytokine production, significantly less lung inflammation and reduced goblet cell numbers in comparison with sham-treated controls.",
        "Previous research has shown that gastric acid suppression by antacid drugs can promote allergic reactions to acid-labile food proteins. No data are available about whether antacid drugs can promote drug hypersensitivity reactions. The most potent and longer lasting inhibition of gastric secretion is provided by proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). We hypothesized that gastric acid suppression by proton pump inhibitors could be causative of drug hypersensitivity reactions during hospitalization.\n\nTo estimate the risk of developing drug hypersensitivity reactions during the hospitalization of patients treated with proton pump inhibitors, and other associated factors.\n\nA nested case-control in a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized patients from September 2008 to December 2010 (70 771 admissions) was conducted using the registry of cases of interconsultations to the Allergy Department (161 confirmed cases of drug hypersensitivity reactions). A total of 318 controls were matched by first drug suspected in the hypersensitivity reaction, time of admission, age, gender and hospitalization wards.\n\nThe relative risk of drug hypersensitivity reaction occurrence during hospitalization of patients treated with PPIs compared with those not treated in the period of study was significant (RR: 3.97; 95% CI: 1.97-8.29). After controlling for confounders in the nested case-control cohort, the use of PPIs persists as a predisposing factor (OR: 4.35; 95% CI: 2-9.45). Personal history of drug allergy and a long hospitalization time were other predisposing factors of drug hypersensitivity reactions (DHRs). The hazard that a DHR has occurred during PPI treatment was 3.7% per day. The hazard for immediate or accelerated reactions was 1.706 (P = 0.003) times that of delayed reactions.",
        "Few studies have focused on pollen exposure and asthma in children. None have examined associations between persistent exposure to pollen in infancy and aeroallergen sensitisation and asthma in childhood.\n\nTo examine the association between higher ambient levels of pollen in the first 3-6 months of life and risk of eczema, sensitization to food and aeroallergens at 2 years and asthma or hayfever at age 6-7 years combined.\n\nUsing a birth cohort of 620 infants with a family history of allergic disease born between 1990 and 1994, we examined risk of eczema or allergic sensitization (SPT > 3 mm to at least one of cow\"s milk, egg white, peanut, house dust-mite, rye grass, and cat dander) by age 2 and asthma or hayfever at age 6-7. Daily ambient levels of pollen were measured during this period.\n\nCumulative exposure to pollen concentrations up to 6 months was associated with aeroallergen sensitization with the highest risk occurring at 3 months (aOR = 1.34, 95% CI 1.06-1.72). Cumulative exposure to pollen up to 3 months was also associated with hayfever (aOR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.009-1.29) and between 4 and 6 months exposure with asthma only (aOR=1.35, 95% CI 1.07-1.72).",
        "To determine the relationship between a history of child abuse and obesity among children admitted for psychiatric hospitalization.\n\nThe charts of 1434 youth consecutively admitted to an inpatient psychiatric facility during a 10-month period were retrospectively analyzed. Rates of physical and sexual abuse, as well as other factors believed to increase the risk of obesity, were compared between children whose body mass index (BMI) percentiles were between 5 and 80 and whose BMI percentiles were >85.\n\nAfter correcting for age, race, gender, and antipsychotic usage, we found that a reported history of sexual abuse was associated with increased probability of being overweight/obese (BMI percentile 85-99) compared with being of typical BMI (aOR 1.41). Reported physical abuse neither increased the risk of obesity nor moderated the association between sexual abuse and increased weight. Antipsychotic treatment and female gender also were associated with increased BMI percentiles, with antipsychotic usage being the only variable associated with increased risk of a BMI percentile >99.",
        "Nausea and vomiting are well recognized in different clinical situations, suggesting that no single mechanism is likely to be responsible for their production. Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) can have a negative impact on quality of life and this may lead to a refusal of curative therapy or to a decline in palliative benefits offered by cytotoxic treatment. Palonosetron is a new agent in the class of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (5-HT3RAs), and differs from the other agents by its higher receptor-binding affinity and longer half-life. These pharmacological properties have resulted in improved antiemetic activity in clinical trials, particularly in the treatment of delayed CINV following moderate emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC).\n\nA systematic review of the medical literature was completed to inform this update. MEDLINE, the Cochrane Collaboration Library and meeting materials from ASCO and MASCC were all searched.",
        "Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) has been shown to play a central role in the promotion of cell motility, but its functional mechanism has remained unclear. With the aim of investigating the diagnostic and treatment modalities for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the signaling pathway that may contribute to TGF-\u03b2-mediated cell invasion in hepatoma cells was evaluated.\n\nThree hepatoma cell lines, HepG2, PLC/PRF/5, and HLF, were treated with TGF-\u03b2, and the involvement of the non-canonical TGF-\u03b2 pathway was analyzed by cell migration assays. HepG2 cells were treated with a p21-activated kinase-2 (PAK2)-targeting small interfering RNA and analyzed for their cell motility. The relationships between the PAK2 status and the clinicopathological characteristics of 62 HCC patients were also analyzed.\n\nThe cell migration assays showed that Akt is a critical regulator of TGF-\u03b2-mediated cell migration. Western blotting analyses showed that TGF-\u03b2 stimulated Akt and PAK2 in all three hepatoma cell lines, and phosphorylated PAK2 was blocked by Akt inhibitor. Suppression of PAK2 expression by small interfering RNA resulted in increased focal adhesions with significantly repressed cell migration in the presence of TGF-\u03b2. Clinicopathological analyses showed that the phosphorylation level of PAK2 was closely associated with tumor progression, metastasis, and early recurrence of HCC.",
        "Sympathetic activation induced by sleep-disordered breathing may contribute to cardiovascular morbidity. However, the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) excludes respiratory effort-related arousals (RERAs) associated with inspiratory flow limitation without oxygen desaturation. We sought to determine whether RERAs are associated with sympathetic activation.\n\nTwenty-five adults (12 males, 13 females) with AHI\\u2009<\\u200910/h and RERA index >5/h were included in this study. Power spectral density analysis was performed on two non-contiguous 10-min segments containing inspiratory flow limitation and arrhythmia-free electrocardiogram during N2 sleep. One segment contained RERA; the other did not, NO-RERA. Spectral power was described in a low-frequency domain (LF; 0.04-0.15\\xa0Hz), primarily sympathetic modulation, and a high frequency domain (HF; 0.15-0.4\\xa0Hz), parasympathetic modulation.\n\nAnalyses of LF and HF powers were made using normalized and absolute values. LF power was greater during RERA compared to NO-RERA (50.3 vs. 30.1\\xa0%, p\\u2009<\\u20090.001) whereas HF power was greater during NO-RERA compared to RERA (69.9 vs. 49.7\\xa0%, p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). The LF/HF ratio was greater during RERA than NO-RERA (1.01 vs. 0.43, p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Gender differences emerged using absolute values of power: The percentage increase in LF power during RERA relative to NO-RERA was significantly greater for females than males, 247.6 vs. 31.9\\xa0%, respectively (p\\u2009<\\u20090.02).",
        "To determine whether accumulation of 2-hydroxyglutarate in IDH-mutated low-grade gliomas (LGG; WHO grade II) correlates with their malignant transformation and to evaluate changes in metabolite levels during malignant progression.\n\nSamples from 54 patients were screened for IDH mutations: 17 patients with LGG without malignant transformation, 18 patients with both LGG and their consecutive secondary glioblastomas (sGBM; n = 36), 2 additional patients with sGBM, 10 patients with primary glioblastomas (pGBM), and 7 patients without gliomas. The cellular tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites, citrate, isocitrate, 2-hydroxyglutarate, \u03b1-ketoglutarate, fumarate, and succinate were profiled by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Ratios of 2-hydroxyglutarate/isocitrate were used to evaluate differences in 2-hydroxyglutarate accumulation in tumors from LGG and sGBM groups, compared with pGBM and nonglioma groups.\n\nIDH1 mutations were detected in 27 (77.1%) of 37 patients with LGG. In addition, in patients with LGG with malignant progression (n = 18), 17 patients were IDH1 mutated with a stable mutation status during their malignant progression. None of the patients with pGBM or nonglioma tumors had an IDH mutation. Increased 2-hydroxyglutarate/isocitrate ratios were seen in patients with IDH1-mutated LGG and sGBM, in comparison with those with IDH1-nonmutated LGG, pGBM, and nonglioma groups. However, no differences in intratumoral 2-hydroxyglutarate/isocitrate ratios were found between patients with LGG with and without malignant transformation. Furthermore, in patients with paired samples of LGG and their consecutive sGBM, the 2-hydroxyglutarate/isocitrate ratios did not differ between both tumor stages.",
        "Preclinical in vivo research on inflammatory bowel diseases requires proper animal models and techniques allowing longitudinal monitoring of colonic inflammation without the need to kill animals. We evaluated colonoscopy and \u03bc-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (\u03bcPET/CT) as monitoring tools in a model for chronic colitis in mice.\n\nColitis was induced by adoptive transfer of CD4(+)CD25(-)CD62L(+) T cells in immunocompromised severe combined immunodeficient mice. Three study protocols were designed. In study 1, colonoscopy and \u00b5PET/CT were performed once, 4 weeks after transfer. In study 2 and study 3, colitis was sequentially followed up through colonoscopy (study 2) or colonoscopy plus \u00b5PET/CT (study 3). Each study included postmortem evaluation of colonic inflammation (macroscopy, microscopy, and myeloperoxidase activity).\n\nIn study 1, both colonoscopy and \u00b5PET/CT detected colitis 4 weeks after transfer. Study 2 showed a gradual increase in colonoscopic score from week 2 (1.4 \u00b1 0.6) to week 8 (6.0 \u00b1 1.1). In study 3, colitis was detected 2 weeks after transfer by \u00b5PET/CT (2.0 \u00b1 0.4) but not by colonoscopy, whereas both techniques detected inflammation 4 and 6 weeks after transfer. Colonoscopy correlated with \u00b5PET/CT (r = 0.812, 0.884, and 0.781, respectively) and with postmortem analyses in all 3 studies.",
        "Deficient peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 coactivator-1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1) function is one component of mitochondrial dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases. Current molecular classification of such diseases is based on the predominant protein accumulating as intra- or extracellular aggregates. Experimental evidence suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired protein processing are closely interrelated. In vitro findings further indicate that PGC-1\u03b1 dysfunction may contribute to protein misfolding in neurodegeneration.\n\nTo systematically evaluate the neuropathological alterations of mice lacking the expression of the full-length PGC-1\u03b1 protein (FL-PGC-1\u03b1) but expressing an N-truncated fragment.\n\nTo assess the pattern of neurodegeneration-related proteins, we performed immunostaining for Tau, pTau, \u03b1-synuclein, amyloid-\u03b2, amyloid precursor protein, prion protein, FUS, TDP-43 and ubiquitin. Using hematoxylin and eosin, Kl\u00fcver-Barrera and Bielschowsky silver stainings and anti-GFAP immunohistochemistry, we performed an anatomical mapping to provide a lesion profile.\n\nThe immunohistochemical pattern of neurodegeneration-related proteins did not differ between FL-PGC-1\u03b1 knockout and wild-type animals, and there was a complete lack of protein deposits or ubiquitin-positive inclusions. The analysis of neuropathological alterations revealed widespread vacuolation predominating in the cerebral white matter, caudate-putamen, thalamus and brainstem, and reactive astrogliosis in the brainstem and cerebellar nuclei. This morphological phenotype was thus reminiscent of human mitochondrial encephalopathies, especially the Kearns-Sayre syndrome.",
        "Major peripheral vascular trauma is managed by several surgical specialties. The impact of surgical specialty training and certification on outcome has not been evaluated. We hypothesized that general surgeons without specialty training in vascular surgery would have outcomes equivalent to surgeons with vascular training in the management of extremity arterial injuries requiring interposition grafting.\n\nWe performed a multicenter, retrospective study of patients undergoing interposition grafting for peripheral vascular injury between 1995 and 2010. Specialty was defined by training and certification. Outcomes were recorded at the time of discharge from the index hospitalization. Factors affecting limb salvage were determined using logistic regression.\n\nFrom the 11 participating centers, 615 patients were identified. General surgeons performed 69.9%, cardiac/vascular surgeons performed 27.3%, and surgeons of other specialties performed 2.8% of the grafts. There were 32 amputations (5.2%). Outcomes did not differ by institution. Factors associated with amputation were blunt mechanism, older age, female sex, hospital length of stay, and Injury Severity Score (ISS). There was no significant difference in limb salvage among specialty groups (general surgeons, 94%; cardiac/vascular, 95%; other, 100%).",
        "Ethanol (EtOH) affects prefrontal cortex functional roles such as decision making, working memory, and behavioral control. Yet, the pharmacological effect of EtOH on dopamine, a neuromodulator in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), is unclear. Past studies exploring this topic produced conflicting outcomes; however, a handful of factors (temporal resolution, method of drug administration, estrous cycle) possibly contributed to these discrepancies. We sought to mitigate these factors in order to elucidate EtOH\"s pharmacological effects on mPFC dopamine in Long-Evans rats.\n\nWe administered experimental solutions via an intravenous (iv), handling-free route, monitored dopamine in the mPFC via microdialysis (10-minute samples), and used male rats to avoid estrous cycle/EtOH interactions. First, we rapidly (approximately 2.7 ml/min) or slowly (approximately 0.6 ml/min) administered 1.0 g/kg EtOH and saline infusions, showing that the experimental methods did not contribute to dopamine changes. Then, a cumulative dosing protocol was used to administer 0.25, 0.75, 1.50, and 2.25 g/kg iv EtOH doses to evaluate dose-response. Finally, we monitored dialysate EtOH levels during an oral EtOH self-administration session to compare the dialysate EtOH levels achieved during the pharmacological experiments to those seen during self-administration.\n\nIV administration of a rapid or slow 1.0 g/kg EtOH infusion resulted in similar significant 55 \u00b1 9 and 63 \u00b1 15% peak dialysate dopamine increases, respectively. The 0.25, 0.75, 1.50, and 2.25 g/kg EtOH doses produced a nonsignificant 17 \u00b1 5% and significant 36 \u00b1 15, 68 \u00b1 19, and 86 \u00b1 20% peak dialysate dopamine increases, respectively. Self-administration dialysate EtOH concentrations fell within the range of concentrations noted during the EtOH dose-response curve.",
        "Chagas heart disease is developed as a result of the infection with Trypanosoma cruzi. Protein malnutrition contributes to secondary immunodeficiency. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of a low protein diet on the production of endothelin-1 and CX3CL1 in blood and cardiac tissue samples in an experimental model with T.\\xa0cruzi infection.\n\nFisher rats were submitted to low protein (6%) and normal protein (15%) diets and then infected with the Y strain of T.\\xa0cruzi. At days 15 and 120, parasites and immune cells were evaluated.\n\nThe low protein diet reduced body weight and circulating serum proteins, but promoted elevation of CX3CL1 and endothelin-1 levels in infected animals, which were unable to control blood parasitemia replication. In heart tissue, the low protein diet reduced cardiac CX3CL1, endothelin-1 and leucocyte infiltration in the acute phase, in particular CD68 and CD163 macrophage phenotypes.",
        "Peripheral serotonin is involved in tumorigenesis and induces a pro-proliferative effect in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells; however, the intracellular mechanisms by which serotonin exerts a mitogenic effect remain unclear. In this research, we examined whether FOXO3a, a transcription factor at the interface of crucial cellular processes, plays a role downstream of serotonin in HCC cells.\n\nThe cell viability and expression of FOXO3a was assessed in three HCC cell lines (Huh7, HepG2 and Hep3B) during serum deprivation in the presence or absence of serotonin. Serum free media significantly inhibited HCC proliferation and led to reduced expression and nuclear accumulation of FOXO3a. Knockdown of FOXO3a enhanced the ability of serum deprivation to inhibit HCC cells proliferation. And overexpression of non-phosphorylated FOXO3a in HCC cells reversed serum-deprivation-induced growth inhibition. Serotonin reversed the serum-deprivation-induced inhibition of cell proliferation and upregulated FOXO3a in Huh7 cells; however, serotonin had no effect on the proliferation of serum-deprived HepG2 or Hep3B cells. In addition to proliferation, serotonin also induced phosphorylation of AKT and FOXO3a in serum-deprived Huh7 cells but not in HepG2 and Hep3B cells. However, the phosphorylation of FOXO3a induced by serotonin did not export FOXO3a from nucleus to cytoplasm in serum-deprived Huh7 cells. Consequently, we demonstrated that serotonin promoted the proliferation of Huh7 cells by increasing the expression of FOXO3a. We also provide preliminary evidence that different expression levels of the 5-HT2B receptor (5-HT2BR) may contribute to the distinct effects of serotonin in different serum-deprived HCC cells.",
        "We hypothesized that the presence of an in-house neurologist or a neurology or emergency medicine (EM) residency is associated with a lower rate of missed stroke diagnosis and a greater use of thrombolytic therapy.\n\nThe outpatient Young Stroke registry from our academic medical center was reviewed. Patients 16 to 50 years of age who presented with ischemic stroke were included. Information on presentation, acute therapy, and missed diagnosis was obtained. The presence of an EM or neurology residency at the presenting hospital was recorded. We also assessed whether hospital teaching status in these fields affected missed diagnosis rates, the use of thrombolysis, or stroke intervention.\n\nNinety-three patients were included. Thirteen patients were misdiagnosed. In hospitals with and without a neurology residency, the missed diagnosis rate was 6.3% versus 18.0%, respectively (P=.21). Two patients were misdiagnosed in hospitals with a neurology residency, but neither had neurology consultations in the emergency department. If these cases are removed from our analysis, the rate of missed diagnosis with and without a neurology residency is 0% versus 20.6%, respectively (P=.008). Acute stroke therapy was administered in 17.9% of patients seen with an EM residency, compared to 2.7% without an EM residency (P=.046). With and without a neurology residency, acute stroke therapy was administered in 25% versus 8.2% of cases, respectively (P=.055).",

This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of ergocalciferol on the dose of erythrocyte-stimulating agent (ESA) administered to children with CKD stage 5 and vitamin D insufficiency.\n\nTwenty patients aged <18 years with CKD stages 5 or 5D and vitamin D insufficiency were divided into two groups. During the 12-week study, ten patients received oral ergocalciferol (treatment) whereas the other ten patients did not (control). The ESA dosage was recorded monthly.\n\nThere were no significant differences in demographic data, ESA dosages, and laboratory data, including corrected calcium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, hemoglobin, ferritin, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D), and transferrin saturation levels, between the two groups at baseline. At the completion of the study, serum 25D levels in the treatment group were significantly increased from baseline (p = 0.02) and were significantly higher than the serum 25D levels in the controls (p < 0.005). The ESA dosage in the treatment group was significantly decreased when compared to baseline (p = 0.04).",
        "The aims of this study were to measure the levels of interleukin (IL)-33 and ST2 and T-helper (Th)2-associated cytokines (IL-13, IL-4, IL-5) in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and examine the correlation of serum cytokine levels with disease activity and laboratory parameters.\n\nSerum IL-33, IL-13, IL-4, and IL-5 levels were assessed by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the mRNA levels of IL-33 and ST2 were quantified by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), in 43 AS samples and compared with 27 age- and sex-matched healthy controls.\n\nSerum IL-33, IL-13, and IL-4 levels were increased significantly in AS patients compared with controls (p < 0.01); moreover, serum IL-33 and IL-13 levels were significantly higher in patients with active AS than in those with inactive AS (p < 0.05). The serum levels of IL-5 showed no significant difference between AS patients and controls (p > 0.05). Serum IL-33 levels were positively correlated with both IL-13 (r = 0.306, p < 0.01) and IL-4 levels (r = 0.432, p < 0.01).

        "Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) gene is considered as a promising candidate for the identification of polymorphisms affecting cattle performance. The objectives of the current study were to determine the association of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) IGF-1/SnaBI with fertility, milk production and body condition traits in Holstein-Friesian dairy cows under grazing conditions.\n\nSeventy multiparous cows from a commercial herd were genotyped for the SNP IGF-1/SnaBI. Fertility measures evaluated were: interval to commencement of luteal activity (CLA), calving to first service (CFS) and calving to conception (CC) intervals. Milk production and body condition score were also evaluated. The study period extended from 3 wk before calving to the fourth month of lactation.",
        "The eyes of giant and colossal squid are among the largest eyes in the history of life. It was recently proposed that sperm whale predation is the main driver of eye size evolution in giant squid, on the basis of an optical model that suggested optimal performance in detecting large luminous visual targets such as whales in the deep sea. However, it is poorly understood how the eye size of giant and colossal squid compares to that of other aquatic organisms when scaling effects are considered.\n\nWe performed a large-scale comparative study that included 87 squid species and 237 species of acanthomorph fish. While squid have larger eyes than most acanthomorphs, a comparison of relative eye size among squid suggests that giant and colossal squid do not have unusually large eyes. After revising constants used in a previous model we found that large eyes perform equally well in detecting point targets and large luminous targets in the deep sea.",
        "The plasminogen system plays many roles in normal epithelial cell function, and components are elevated in diseases, such as cancer and asthma. The relative contribution of each component to epithelial function is unclear. We characterized normal cell function in airway epithelial cells with increased expression of selected pathway components.\n\nBEAS-2B R1 bronchial epithelial cells stably overexpressing membrane urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (muPAR), soluble spliced uPAR (ssuPAR), the ligand (uPA) or inhibitors (PAI1 or PAI2), were characterized for pathway expression. Cell function was examined using proliferation, apoptosis, and scratch wound assays. A549 alveolar epithelial cells overexpressing muPAR were similarly characterized and downstream plasmin activity, MMP-1, and MMP-9 measured.\n\nElevated expression of individual components led to changes in the plasminogen system expression profile, indicating coordinated regulation of the pathway. Increased muPAR expression augmented wound healing rate in BEAS-2B R1 and attenuated repair in A549 cells. Elevated expression of other system components had no effect on cell function in BEAS-2B R1 cells. This is the first study to investigate activity of the splice variant ssuPAR, with results suggesting that this variant plays a limited role in epithelial cell function in this model.",
        "To investigate the effects of safflor yellow A (SYA), a flavonoid extracted from Carthamus tinctorius L, on cultured rat cardiomyocytes exposed to anoxia/reoxygenation (A/R).\n\nPrimary cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were exposed to anoxia for 3 h followed by reoxygenation for 6 h. The cell viability was measured using MTT assay. The releases of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK), level of malondialdehyde (MDA), and activities of glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were analyzed. Hoechst 33258 staining and changes in Bcl-2/Bax ratio and caspase 3 activity were used to examine A/R-induced apoptosis.\n\nThe A/R exposure markedly decreased the viability of cardiomyocytes, suppressed the activities of SOD, GSH, CAT and GSH-Px, and Bcl-2 protein expression. Meanwhile, the A/R exposure markedly increased the release of LDH and CK, and MDA production in the cardiomyocytes, and increased the rate of apoptosis, caspase 3 activity, Bax protein expression. Pretreatment with SYA (40, 60 and 80 nmol/L) concentration-dependently blocked the A/R-induced changes in the cardiomyocytes. Pretreatment of the cardiomyocytes with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 200 \u03bcmol/L) produced protective effects that were comparable to those caused by SYA (80 nmol/L).",
        "Blood pressure (BP) should be kept within a narrow range to allow adequate tissue perfusion. In particular, heart-rate variability (HRV) can be used to assess autonomic cardiovascular modulation, and flow-mediated dilation (FMD) can provide valuable information about the ability of the cardiovascular system to adapt to different pressures. Our objective in the study described here was to investigate the effect of a difference of 10mm Hg in mean arterial pressure (MAP) on endothelial function and autonomic balance in young and normotensive soccer players.\n\nTwenty-nine young male soccer players (mean age 17.7 years) were divided into two groups according to their MAP (mm Hg): MAP-84 and MAP-94. The BP, FMD, HRV and maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) of each group were measured.\n\nSystolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) were significantly higher (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.006, respectively) in the MAP-94 group. There were no differences in VO2max and endothelial function in the two groups (P < 0.7699). However, the standard deviation (SD) of normal RR intervals (SDNN) and the square root of the mean squared differences in successive RR intervals (RMSSD) were significantly lower in the MAP-94 than in the MAP-84 group (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.005, respectively). In the MAP-94 group, both the high-and low-frequency components were significantly (P < 0.001, P < 0.021, P < 0.017, respectively) lower in both absolute and normalized units, whereas the LF/HF ratio was significantly (P < 0.012) higher.",
        "Studies that investigated possible associations between the complexity of proximal humeral fractures and patient characteristics are rare. We hypothesized that the grade of fracture complexity may correlate with age and gender of hospitalized, adult patients.\n\nBased on the Neer classification, we defined four radiological grades of fracture complexity. The data of adult patients that were treated during a 9-year period at a German hospital serving a town of 80,000 inhabitants was reviewed.\n\nSeven hundred and eighty fractures were evaluated [518 female/262 male (66.41/33.59\\xa0%), average age 64.2\\xa0years (range 17.4-99.2)]. During the study period, the number of fractures increased to 167\\xa0%. Almost two-thirds of the patients were females and older than 60\\xa0years. Of all fractures, 86\\xa0% were displaced fractures. In patients younger than 60\\xa0years, 1.99-fold more complex fractures occurred in males (32.4\\xa0%) than in females (16.2\\xa0%). In contrast, in patients older than 60\\xa0years, 1.72-fold more complex fractures occurred in females (54.1\\xa0%) than in males (31.5\\xa0%). There was a significant association between low-energy trauma and female gender older than 60\\xa0years.",
        "Estrogen, a class of female sex steroids, is neuroprotective. Estrogen is synthesized in specific areas of the brain. There is a possibility that the de novo synthesized estrogen exerts protective effect in brain, although direct evidence for the neuroprotective function of brain-synthesized estrogen has not been clearly demonstrated. Methylmercury (MeHg) is a neurotoxin that induces neuronal degeneration in the central nervous system. The neurotoxicity of MeHg is region-specific, and the molecular mechanisms for the selective neurotoxicity are not well defined. In this study, the protective effect of de novo synthesized 17\u03b2-estradiol on MeHg-induced neurotoxicity in rat hippocampus was examined.\n\nNeurotoxic effect of MeHg on hippocampal organotypic slice culture was quantified by propidium iodide fluorescence imaging. Twenty-four-hour treatment of the slices with MeHg caused cell death in a dose-dependent manner. The toxicity of MeHg was attenuated by pre-treatment with exogenously added estradiol. The slices de novo synthesized estradiol. The estradiol synthesis was not affected by treatment with 1 \u00b5M MeHg. The toxicity of MeHg was enhanced by inhibition of de novo estradiol synthesis, and the enhancement of toxicity was recovered by the addition of exogenous estradiol. The neuroprotective effect of estradiol was inhibited by an estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist, and mimicked by pre-treatment of the slices with agonists for ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2, indicating the neuroprotective effect was mediated by ERs.",
        "Red blood cell transfusion (RBCT) may increase the risk of thrombotic events (TE) in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) through changes induced by storage coupled with SAH-related hypercoagulability. We sought to investigate the association between RBCT and the risk of TE in patients with SAH.\n\n205 consecutive patients with acute, aneurysmal SAH admitted to the neurovascular intensive care unit of a tertiary care, academic medical center between 3/2008 and 7/2009 were enrolled in a retrospective, observational cohort study. TE were defined as the composite of venous thromboembolism (VTE), myocardial infarction (MI), and cerebral infarction noted on brain CT scan. Secondary endpoints included the risk of VTE, poor outcome (modified Rankin score 3-6 at discharge), and in-hospital mortality.\n\n86/205 (42 %) received RBCT. Eighty-eight (43 %) had a thrombotic complication. Forty (34 %) of 119 non-transfused and 48/86 (56 %) transfused patients had a TE (p = 0.002). In multivariate analysis, RBCT was associated with more TE by [OR 2.4; 95 % CI (1.2, 4.6); p = 0.01], VTE [OR 2.3; 95 % CI (1.0, 5.2); p = 0.04], and poor outcome [OR 5.0; 95 % CI (1.9, 12.8); p < 0.01]. The risk of TE increased by 55 % per unit transfused when controlling for univariate variables. Neither mean nor maximum age of blood was significantly associated with thrombotic risk.",
        "The embryo of the crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis has a total, unequal and invariant early cleavage pattern. It specifies cell fates earlier than other arthropods, including Drosophila, as individual blastomeres of the 8-cell stage are allocated to the germ layers and the germline. Furthermore, the 8-cell stage is amenable to embryological manipulations. These unique features make Parhyale a suitable system for elucidating germ layer specification in arthropods. Since asymmetric localization of maternally provided RNA is a widespread mechanism to specify early cell fates, we asked whether this is also true for Parhyale. A candidate gene approach did not find RNAs that are asymmetrically distributed at the 8-cell stage. Therefore, we designed a high-density microarray from 9400 recently sequenced ESTs (1) to identify maternally provided RNAs and (2) to find RNAs that are differentially distributed among cells of the 8-cell stage.\n\nMaternal-zygotic transition takes place around the 32-cell stage, i.e. after the specification of germ layers. By comparing a pool of RNAs from early embryos without zygotic transcription to zygotic RNAs of the germband, we found that more than 10% of the targets on the array were enriched in the maternal transcript pool. A screen for asymmetrically distributed RNAs at the 8-cell stage revealed 129 transcripts, from which 50% are predominantly expressed in the early embryonic stages. Finally, we performed knockdown experiments for two of these genes and observed cell-fate-related defects of embryonic development.",
        "Schizophrenia is associated with lower pre-morbid intelligence (IQ) in addition to (pre-morbid) cognitive decline. Both schizophrenia and IQ are highly heritable traits. Therefore, we hypothesized that genetic variants associated with schizophrenia, including copy number variants (CNVs) and a polygenic schizophrenia (risk) score (PSS), may influence intelligence.\n\nIQ was estimated with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS). CNVs were determined from single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data using the QuantiSNP and PennCNV algorithms. For the PSS, odds ratios for genome-wide SNP data were calculated in a sample collected by the Psychiatric Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) Consortium (8690 schizophrenia patients and 11 831 controls). These were used to calculate individual PSSs in our independent sample of 350 schizophrenia patients and 322 healthy controls.\n\nAlthough significantly more genes were disrupted by deletions in schizophrenia patients compared to controls (p = 0.009), there was no effect of CNV measures on IQ. The PSS was associated with disease status (R 2 = 0.055, p = 2.1 \u00d7 10-7) and with IQ in the entire sample (R 2 = 0.018, p = 0.0008) but the effect on IQ disappeared after correction for disease status.",
        "The results from recent brain-machine interface (BMI) studies suggest that it may be more efficient to use simple arbitrary relationships between individual neuron activity and BMI movements than the complex relationship observed between neuron activity and natural movements. This idea is based on the assumption that individual neurons can be conditioned independently regardless of their natural movement association.\n\nWe tested this assumption in the parietal reach region (PRR), an important candidate area for BMIs in which neurons encode the target location for reaching movements. Monkeys could learn to elicit arbitrarily assigned activity patterns, but the seemingly arbitrary patterns always belonged to the response set for natural reaching movements. Moreover, neurons that are free from conditioning showed correlated responses with the conditioned neurons as if they encoded common reach targets. Thus, learning was accomplished by finding reach targets (intrinsic variable of PRR neurons) for which the natural response of reach planning could approximate the arbitrary patterns.",
        "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a systemic inflammatory disorder that affects the entire vascular system. Endovascular therapy (EVT) is the first surgical treatment choice in a large number of patients who suffer from this disease. However, late clinical failure after primarily successful interventions, with the need of a new reintervention, is the major drawback of this technique. The aim of this study is to determine the possible association between serum high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and fibrinogen levels both preintervention and during follow-up, and the outcomes of EVT and their association with the incidence of cardiovascular events or death in these patients.\n\nThis is a prospective cohort study in patients diagnosed with PAD in the iliac, femoral, popliteal, or distal sectors, within Rutherford category 3-5 who underwent EVT de novo. We determined levels of hsCRP and fibrinogen before surgery and during the follow-up period (at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months). We analyzed the possible association among inflammatory markers levels before EVT, during 1 year of follow-up and its variation during that year, and the incidence of reintervention, reintervention-free survival, and the occurrence of cardiovascular events or death.\n\nOver the course of 1 year, 246 patients underwent a revascularizing treatment of the lower limbs; 64 patients qualified for inclusion in this study. In these 64 patients, a significant increase between basal hsCRP and fibrinogen levels and the incidence of reintervention (P=0.002 and 0.013, respectively) and death (P=0.001 and 0.013, respectively) during follow-up was found. A significant increase between higher hsCRP basal levels and the incidence of cardiovascular events during the follow-up period was also noted (P=0.004). Levels of basal hsCRP were related to reintervention-free survival after EVT (P=0.04). On the basis of the rate of hsCRP variation and its association with reintervention-free survival, we observed a progressive reduction of the levels of hsCRP until 12 months after the primary procedure.",
        "To investigate the relationship between ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase-1(ENPP-1) expression and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21) of end-plate chondrocytes after stimulation with intermittent cyclic mechanical tension (ICMT) by using an FX-4000T Flexercell Tension Plus unit.\n\nRat end-plate chondrocytes were cultured and ICMT (strain at 0.5 Hz sinusoidal curve at 10% elongation) applied for 7 days for 4 h/day and cultured for a further 2 days. End-plate chondrocytes were also exposed to 10 ng/mL of TGF-\u03b21. Then, using small interfering RNA technology, small interfering TGF-\u03b21 (siTGF-\u03b21) was transfected. Expression of ENPP-1 and TGF-\u03b21 was measured by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting.\n\nExpression of both ENPP-1 and TGF-\u03b21 was up-regulated after ICMT. Both RT-PCR and western blot showed that ENPP-1 expression decreases with siRNA TGF-\u03b21 after 3% elongation 40 min, and cultured for an additional 2 days.",
        "Infusion of purified haptoglobin (Hp) functions as an effective hemoglobin (Hb) scavenging therapeutic in animal models of hemolysis to prevent cardiovascular and renal injury. Epidemiologic studies demonstrate the phenotype heterogeneity of human Hp proteins and suggest differing vascular protective potential imparted by the dimeric Hp1-1 and the polymeric Hp2-2.\n\nIn vitro experiments and in vivo studies in guinea pigs were performed to evaluate phenotype-specific differences in Hp therapeutics. We found no differences between the two phenotypes in Hb binding and intravascular compartmentalization of Hb in vivo. Both Hp1-1 and Hp2-2 attenuate Hb-induced blood pressure response and renal iron deposition. These findings were consistent with equal prevention of Hb endothelial translocation. The modulation of oxidative Hb reactions by the two Hp phenotypes was not found to be different. Both phenotypes stabilize the ferryl (Fe(4+)) Hb transition state, provide heme retention within the complex, and prevent Hb-driven low-density lipoprotein (LDL) peroxidation. Hb-mediated peroxidation of LDL resulted in endothelial toxicity, which was equally blocked by the addition of Hp1-1 and Hp2-2.",
        "Congenital multiple intestinal atresia (MIA) is a severe, fatal neonatal disorder, involving the occurrence of obstructions in the small and large intestines ultimately leading to organ failure. Surgical interventions are palliative but do not provide long-term survival. Severe immunodeficiency may be associated with the phenotype. A genetic basis for MIA is likely. We had previously ascertained a cohort of patients of French-Canadian origin, most of whom were deceased as infants or in utero. The goal of the study was to identify the molecular basis for the disease in the patients of this cohort.\n\nWe performed whole exome sequencing on samples from five patients of four families. Validation of mutations and familial segregation was performed using standard Sanger sequencing in these and three additional families with deceased cases. Exon skipping was assessed by reverse transcription-PCR and Sanger sequencing.\n\nFive patients from four different families were each homozygous for a four base intronic deletion in the gene TTC7A, immediately adjacent to a consensus GT splice donor site. The deletion was demonstrated to have deleterious effects on splicing causing the skipping of the attendant upstream coding exon, thereby leading to a predicted severe protein truncation. Parents were heterozygous carriers of the deletion in these families and in two additional families segregating affected cases. In a seventh family, an affected case was compound heterozygous for the same 4bp deletion and a second missense mutation p.L823P, also predicted as pathogenic. No other sequenced genes possessed deleterious variants explanatory for all patients in the cohort. Neither mutation was seen in a large set of control chromosomes.",
        "Low oxygen concentration (hypoxia) in tumors strongly affects their malignant state and resistance to therapy. These effects may be more deleterious in regions undergoing cycling hypoxia. Electron paramagnetic resonance imaging (EPRI) has provided a noninvasive, quantitative imaging modality to investigate static pO2 in vivo. However, to image changing hypoxia, EPRI images with better temporal resolution may be required. The tradeoff between temporal resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) results in lower SNR for EPRI images with imaging time short enough to resolve cycling hypoxia.\n\nPrincipal component analysis allows for accelerated image acquisition with acceptable SNR by filtering noise in projection data, from which pO2 images are reconstructed. Principal component analysis is used as a denoising technique by including only low-order components to approximate the EPRI projection data.\n\nSimulated and experimental studies show that principal component analysis filtering increases SNR, particularly for small numbers of sub-volumes with changing pO2 , enabling an order of magnitude increase in temporal resolution with minimal deterioration in spatial resolution or image quality.",

        "Fatty acid synthase (FAS) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) are overexpressed in a series of cancers. However, few studies have investigated the potential role of FAS and HER2 in esophageal carcinoma. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of FAS and HER2 and the possible link between FAS/HER2 expression and the pathological prognostic variables.\n\nThe frequency of FAS and HER2 expression was determined immunohistochemically. The overall survival rate was analysed by the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test using SPSS 17.0 software.\n\nThe majority of the cases were esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (n=142). FAS and HER2 overexpression in the studied cases are 73.2% and 14.1%, respectively. There was a significant difference in FAS expression regarding tumor differentiation and FAS overexpression showed its prognostic value for patients with different tumor differentiation. Meanwhile, HER2 overexpression did not significantly relate to the clinicopathological characteristics of the tumors, with the only exception of the surgical margins.",
        "Clonidine is an \u03b12-agonist which is used as a sedative premedication in children. There are conflicting results in the published literature about the effect of clonidine on the incidence of post operative nausea and vomiting (PONV). We therefore decided to evaluate the effect of oral clonidine given preoperatively on the incidence of PONV in children after appendectomy.\n\nSixty children, 5-12 years old, classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I and II, who were scheduled for appendecectomy were enrolled in this randomized double blinded clinical trial. Patients were randomly assigned into two groups of 30 patients. Patients in clonidine group were given 4 \u00b5g.kg -1 clonidine in 20 cc of apple juice and patients in control group were given only 20 cc of apple juice 1 hour before transporting to operating room. The protocol of general anesthesia and postoperative analgesia was the same for two groups. Incidence of PONV and antiemetic usage of patients were assessed during 0-24 hours after anesthesia.\n\nThe patients\" characteristics were similar in two groups. Patients who had received clonidine had significantly less episodes of PONV and also less rescue antiemetic usage than patients in control group.",
        "We have previously shown that the danger signal high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) promotes angiogenesis when administered to ischemic muscle. HMGB1 signals through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) as well as the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE). However, the actions of these receptors in ischemic injury and muscle recovery are not known. We hypothesize that TLR4 mediates tissue recovery and angiogenesis in response to ischemia.\n\nFemoral artery ligation was performed in control, TLR4 competent (C3H/HeOuJ) and incompetent (C3H/HeJ) mice, as well as RAGE knockout mice and their C57B6 control counterparts. In other experiments, control mice were pretreated with anti-HMGB1 neutralizing antibody before femoral artery ligation. After 2 weeks, limb perfusion was evaluated using laser Doppler perfusion imaging and reported as the ratio of blood flow in the ischemic to nonischemic limb. Muscle necrosis, fat replacement, and vascular density in the anterior tibialis muscle were quantified histologically. In\\xa0vitro, TLR4 and RAGE expression was evaluated in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells in response to hypoxia. Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells treated with HMGB1 alone and in the presence of anti-TLR4 antibody were probed for phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), a signaling molecule critical to endothelial cell (EC) angiogenic behavior.\n\nBoth anti-HMGB1 antibody as well as defective TLR4 signaling in HeJ mice resulted in prominent muscle necrosis 2 weeks after femoral artery ligation. Control HeOuJ mice had less necrosis than TLR4 incompetent HeJ mice, but a greater amount of fat replacement. In contrast to control C3H mice, control C57B6 mice demonstrated prominent muscle regeneration with very little necrosis. Muscle regeneration was not dependent on RAGE. While vascular density did not differ between strains, mice with intact RAGE and TLR4 signaling had less blood flow in ischemic limbs compared with mutant strains. In\\xa0vitro, EC TLR4 expression increased in response to hypoxia while TLR4 antagonism decreased HMGB1-induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase.",
        "Myocardial necrosis occurs frequently in elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and is associated with subsequent major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). This study assessed the protective effect of remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) in patients undergoing successful drug-eluting stent implantation with normal baseline troponin values.\n\nWe analyzed 205 participants with normal baseline troponin values undergoing successful coronary stent implantation. Subjects were randomized to 2 groups: The RIPC group (n = 101), whose members received RIPC (created by three 5-minute inflations of a pneumatic medical tourniquet cuff to 200 mm Hg around the upper arm, interspersed with 5-minute intervals of reperfusion) < 2 hours before the PCI procedure, and the control group (n = 104).\n\nThe primary outcomes were high sensitive cardiac troponin I (hscTnI) levels and incidence of myocardial infarction (MI 4a, defined as hscTnI > 0.20 ng/mL) at 16 hours after the PCI procedure. The median hscTnI at 16 hours after PCI was lower in the RIPC group compared with the unpreconditioned, control group (0.11 vs 0.21 ng/mL; P < 0.01). The incidence of MI 4a was lower in the RIPC group compared with the control group (39% vs 54%, P < 0.05). Index of renal function showed no difference between the 2 groups at 16 hours after PCI (P > 0.05).",
        "We had previously reported that chronic hypoxia induces androgen-independent growth in the human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. In this study, we have identified a key molecule, the Vav3 oncogene, and investigated the effects of Vav3 overexpression on cancer cell growth and malignant behavior and the possible apoptosis-inducing effect of Vav3 expression knockdown by small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) in LNCaP cells under chronic hypoxia (LNCaP/CH).\n\nHypoxia-inducible oncogenes were identified by complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) microarray and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis in order to investigate gene ontology and functional pathways and networks. siRNA was used to knockdown the Vav3 target gene and analyze the effects on proliferation, invasion, migration, and apoptosis of LNCaP/CH cells. Vav3 cDNA was transfected into LNCaP cells under normoxia (LNCaP/N) to establish Vav3-overexpressing clonal cell lines, whose proliferation, invasion, and migration was then examined. Immunoblot analysis was used to investigate the activation of Akt, a Vav3 downstream target molecule.\n\ncDNA microarray analysis and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified Vav3 as a hypoxia-inducible oncogene that was highly associated with malignant behavior. Vav3 messenger RNA and protein expression in LNCaP/CH cells were higher than in LNCaP/N and LNCaP cells cultured under acute hypoxia (LNCaP/AH). The growth rate of LNCaP/CH cells was lower than that of LNCaP/N cells but higher than that of LNCaP/AH cells. LNCaP/CH cells showed higher invasion and migration than LNCaP/N and LNCaP/AH cells. Interrupting Vav3 expression strongly suppressed the proliferation, invasion, and migration of LNCaP/CH cells. Furthermore, siRNA led to apoptosis with increased caspase-3 and cleaved poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase activation in LNCaP/CH cells. Stable Vav3 overexpression in LNCaP cells promoted cell proliferation, invasion, and migration with Akt activation.",
        "Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased risk of colorectal neoplasia. However, association between prediabetes and colorectal adenoma has not been reported.\n\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between prediabetes and the presence of colorectal adenomas.\n\nConsecutive prediabetic subjects who underwent screening colonoscopy were enrolled at Kyung Hee University Hospital in Gangdong, Seoul, Korea, between June 2006 and May 2012. Non-prediabetic subjects were separately pooled from the database of the Center for Health Promotion between January 2012 and May 2012. Prediabetes was defined according to the recommendations of the American Diabetes Association. The prevalence of colorectal adenomas and their characteristics were compared between prediabetic and non-prediabetic groups.\n\nThe prevalence of colorectal adenoma was higher in prediabetic subjects than in non-prediabetic subjects (39.6 vs. 30.6 %, respectively, p = 0.019). Prediabetic subjects had more multiple and high-risk adenomas than the control group in non-matched analysis (p = 0.000, respectively). In age-matched analysis, the prevalence of multiple and high-risk adenomas were significantly higher in a prediabetic group than those in a control group (44.4 vs. 28.4 %, p = 0.034; 51.9 vs. 34.6 %, p = 0.026, respectively). Furthermore, prediabetes (odds ratio = 2.198; 95 % confidence interval = 1.042-4.637; p = 0.039) was found to be an independent risk factor for a high-risk adenoma by multivariate analysis.",

        "Fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) are a major cell population of the pannus that invades adjacent cartilage and bone in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The study was undertaken to determine the effect of interleukin-17 (IL-17) on the survival and/or proliferation of FLSs from RA patients and to investigate whether signal tranducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is implicated in this process.\n\nBcl-2 and Bax expression in FLSs was determined using the real-time PCR and western blot analysis. The expression of Bcl-2 and phosphoSTAT3 in synovial tissues was investigated by confocal microscope. Apoptosis of FLSs was detected by Annexin V/propidium iodide staining and/or phase contrast microscopy. The proliferation of FLSs was determined by CCK-8 ELISA assay.\n\nThe pro-apoptotic Bax is decreased and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 is increased in FLSs from RA patients compared with those from patients with osteoarthritis (OA). IL-17 upregulated the expression of Bcl-2 in FLSs from RA patients, but not in FLSs from OA patients. STAT3 was found to mediate IL-17-induced Bcl-2 upregulation in FLSs from RA patients. Additionally, IL-17 promoted the survival and proliferation of FLSs from RA patients. Most importantly, treatment with STAT3 inhibitor reversed the protective effect of IL-17 on FLSs apoptosis induced by sodium nitroprusside (SNP).",
        "The olfactory epithelium is a self-renewing tissue, able to produce new neurons as needed from stem and progenitor cells in its basal layers. In addition, there exists a mesenchymal-like stem cell (MSC) located within the underlying lamina propria. Little is known about the function of this nasal MSC, or its relationship to the olfactory lineage, but there is considerable interest in using the nasal MSC for cell-based therapies. We sought to further explore the biology of the nasal MSC by establishing neurosphere cultures from adult human nasal biopsies, and to examine the anatomic distribution of nasal MSCs.\n\nNasal biopsies from human patients (n = 5) were obtained from superior, middle, and inferior turbinates or septum. Tissue was cultured to obtain nasal MSCs. Cultures were analyzed by immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry, as well as for differentiation capacity.\n\nAlthough olfactory sensory neuroepithelium is restricted to superior regions in the nasal cavity, neurosphere-forming MSC cultures were, surprisingly, obtained from olfactory as well as non-olfactory regions. These MSC cultures exhibit characteristic robust neurosphere formation and express CD90, CD105, STRO-1, and nestin. Nasal MSCs were found to give rise to neuronal-like cells under differentiation conditions.",

Platelet count displayed a significant risk transformation from an independent risk factor for cardiovascular mortality in very elderly AMI patients (adj. hazard ratio (HR) per 1-SD increase 1\u00b725;95%CI 1\u00b702-1\u00b754;P = 0\u00b7028), via displaying no association with mortality in the intermediate age group (P = 0\u00b710), to a strong inverse association in young patients (adj. HR 0\u00b736;95%CI 0\u00b718-0\u00b768;P = 0\u00b7002).",
        "The mechanisms that differentiate rabies infections into furious and paralytic forms remain undetermined. There are no neuropathological features in human brains that distinguish furious and paralytic rabies. This could be due to methodology and/or examination of specimens late in the disease course.In this study, postmortem examination of brain (5 furious and 5 paralytic) and spinal cord (3 furious and 3 paralytic) specimens was performed in 10 rabies-infected dogs, sacrificed shortly after developing the illness. Rabies virus (RABV) antigen (percentage of positive neurons, average antigen area in positive neurons and average antigen area per neuron) and RNA were quantified at 15 different central nervous system (CNS) regions. The distribution and degree of inflammation were also studied.\n\nMore RABV antigen was detected in furious rabies than paralytic in many of the CNS regions studied. Caudal-rostral polarity of viral antigen distribution was found in both clinical forms in order from greatest to least: spinal cord, brainstem, cerebellum, midline structures (caudate, thalamus), hippocampus, and cerebrum. In contrast, RABV RNA was most abundant in the cerebral midline structures. Viral RNA was found at significantly higher levels in the cerebral cortex, thalamus, midbrain and medulla of dogs with the furious subtype. The RNA levels in the spinal cord were comparable in both clinical forms. A striking inflammatory response was found in paralytic rabies in the brainstem.",
        "Ectopic fat accumulation in liver and skeletal muscle may be an essential link between abdominal obesity, insulin resistance and increased risk of cardiovascular disease after menopause. We hypothesized that a diet containing a relatively high content of protein and unsaturated fat [mainly monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs)] but limited carbohydrates and saturated fat would reduce lipid content in liver and muscle and increase insulin sensitivity in postmenopausal women.\n\nTen healthy, nonsmoking postmenopausal women with a body mass index (BMI) >27 (28-35) kg m(-2) were included in the study.\n\nParticipants were instructed to consume an ad libitum Palaeolithic-type diet intended to provide approximately 30 energy percentage (E%) protein, 40 E% fat (mainly MUFAs) and 30 E% carbohydrate. Intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) levels in calf muscles and liver triglyceride levels were quantified using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1) H-MRS) before and 5 weeks after dietary intervention. Insulin sensitivity was estimated by homoeostasis model assessment (HOMA) indices and the euglycaemic hyperinsulinaemic clamp technique.\n\nMean energy intake decreased by 25% with a weight loss of 4.5 kg. BMI, waist and hip circumference, waist/hip ratio and abdominal sagittal diameter also decreased significantly, as did diastolic blood pressure (mean -7 mmHg), levels of fasting serum glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL/HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B (ApoB) and apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), urinary C-peptide and HOMA indices. Whole-body insulin sensitivity did not change. Liver triglyceride levels decreased by 49%, whereas IMCL levels in skeletal muscle were not significantly altered.",
        "The purpose of this study was to investigate whether combined administration of celecoxib and sevoflurane after ischaemia produces additive neuroprotection against transient global cerebral ischaemia in rats.\n\nCerebral ischaemia was induced by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion with haemorrhagic hypotension for 8 min. After ischaemia, no drugs were administered in the sham (n=4) and control (n=10) groups. In the celecoxib group (n=10), celecoxib 2 mg kg(-1) was administered after reperfusion. In the sevoflurane group (n=10), after reperfusion, sevoflurane 2.4% was inhaled two times for 5 min each at an interval of 10 min to achieve postconditioning. In the celecoxib+sevoflurane group (n=10), administration of celecoxib 2 mg kg(-1) and the sevoflurane postconditioning were performed simultaneously. Necrotic or apoptotic cells were examined in the hippocampus 7 days after ischaemia. Serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines including tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin-1\u03b2 were measured 2 h, and 3 and 7 days after ischaemia.\n\nNecrotic or apoptotic cells were observed more frequently in the control group than in the celecoxib or sevoflurane groups 7 days after ischaemia (P<0.05). Cytokine levels were higher in the control group when compared with the celecoxib or sevoflurane groups 2 h after ischaemia (P<0.05). However, the histological outcomes and cytokine levels were similar in all three groups treated with celecoxib or sevoflurane.",
        "Functional role of Annexin A1 in tumorigenesis is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between Annexin A1 protein expression and pathological differentiation grade in biopsy samples from a large cohort of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC); and to evaluate the potential role of Annexin A1 on cell proliferation and tumorigenesis of OSCC.\n\nWe investigated the relationship between Annexin A1 expression by immunohistochemical staining and pathological differentiation grade of biopsy samples from 232 OSCC patients, and the relationship between Annexin A1 expression and cell proliferation as well as tumor formation using both in vitro and in vivo OSCC models.\n\nAnnexin A1 expression correlated significantly with pathological differentiation grade in OSCC patients, a lower Annexin A1 expression correlating with a poorer differentiation grade. Forced Annexin A1 overexpression in OSCC cell lines, CAL27 and Tca8113, significantly reduced the cell proliferation whereas down-regulation of Annexin A1 expression in OSCC cell line, HB96, significantly increased proliferation of HB96 cells. Tumors formed from CAL27 cells overexpressing Annexin A1 grown significantly slower compared to the parental CAL27 cells in nude mice and showed a significantly reduced nuclear Ki-67 labeling index. Interestingly, these tumors also showed a well differentiated histology pattern whereas the tumors formed from the parental cells were consistently moderately differentiated.",
        "A multi-turn transmit surface coil design was presented to improve B1 efficiency when used with current source amplification.\n\nThree different coil designs driven by an on-coil current-mode class-D amplifier with current envelope feedback were tested on the benchtop and through imaging in a 1.5 T scanner. Case temperature of the power field-effect transistor at the amplifier output stage was measured to evaluate heat dissipation for the different current levels and coil configurations. In addition, a lower power rated device was tested to exploit the potential gain in B1 obtained with the multi-turn coil.\n\nAs shown both on the benchtop and in a 1.5 T scanner, B1 was increased by almost 3-fold without increasing heat dissipation on the power device at the amplifier\"s output using a multi-turn surface coil. Similar gain was obtained when connecting a lower power rated field-effect transistor to the multi-turn coil.",
        "The incidence of Alzheimer disease may increase after surgical interventions. Amyloid \u03b2-protein (A\u03b2) fibrillogenesis, which is closely related to Alzheimer disease, is reportedly accelerated by exposure to anesthetics. However, the effects of GM1 ganglioside (GM1) on \u0391\u03b2 fibrillogenesis have not yet been reported. The current study was designed to examine whether the anesthetics propofol and thiopental are associated with \u0391\u03b2 assembly and GM1 expression on the neuronal cell surface.\n\nPC12N cells and cultured neuronal cells were treated with propofol or thiopental, and GM1 expression in treated and untreated cells was determined by the specific binding of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated cholera toxin subunit B (n = 5). The effects of an inhibitor of the \u03b3-aminobutyric acid A receptor was also examined (n= 5). In addition, the effects of the anesthetics on GM1 liposome-induced \u0391\u03b2 assembly were investigated (n = 5). Finally, the neurotoxicity of the assembled \u0391\u03b2 fibrils was studied by the lactate dehydrogenase release assay (n = 6).\n\nPropofol (31.2 \u00b1 4.7%) and thiopental (34.6 \u00b1 10.5%) decreased GM1 expression on the cell surface through the \u03b3-aminobutyric acid A receptor. The anesthetics inhibited \u0391\u03b2 fibril formation from soluble \u0391\u03b2 in cultured neurons. Moreover, propofol and thiopental suppressed GM1-induced fibril formation in a cell-free system (propofol, 75.8 \u00b1 1.9%; thiopental, 83.6 \u00b1 1.9%) and reduced the neurotoxicity of a mixture containing A\u03b2 and GM1 liposomes (propofol, 35.3 \u00b1 16.4%; thiopental, 21.3 \u00b1 11.6%).",
        "The management of hemodynamically unstable patients with severe pelvic fractures remains a challenge. Various treatment strategies have been advocated. This study analyzed the value of transcatheter angiographic embolization (TAE) for persistent haemodynamic instability after initial fracture stabilization.\n\nFrom January 2002 to July 2011, 803 patients were identified with pelvic fractures, 295 of them (37%) were presenting with unstable pelvic fractures. Fifteen patients, all with unstable fractures (2%), remained hypotensive (systolic blood pressure<90 mmHg) despite adequate fluid resuscitation and emergent surgical fracture stabilization, subsequently underwent TAE.\n\nThe median age in the TAE-group was 57.9 years\u00b120.12 (min 22; max 82) and the median ISS (injury severity score) was 35.8\u00b111.7 (min 22; max 66). 13 out of 15 patients (87%) received initial external fixation and 2 patients (13%) where treated with a C-Clamp before TAE. Radiological success, defined as absence of contrast extravasation on completion angiography, was observed in all 15 patients. In total 3 (20%) patients died during the period of hospitalization, none of them owing to persistent or recurrent pelvic haemorrhage. In the remaining 12 patients, no early or late complications of TAE were identified. Preperitoneal pelvic packing was performed in two patients, both had open pelvic fractures.",
        "Hyponatremia is a common complication occurring in one third of patients after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). One mechanism that likely mediates the development of hyponatremia in SAH is cerebral salt wasting syndrome (CSWS), which induces natriuresis and reduces total blood volume, resulting in a risk of symptomatic vasospasm (SVS). The mineral corticoid fludrocortisone acetate enhances sodium reabsorption in the renal distal tubules and may help prevent post-SAH hyponatremia. However, management with fludrocortisone acetate is ineffective if hyponatremia is advanced, because CSWS and subsequent SVS develop rapidly. Therefore, an additional earlier marker is required to predict the development of hyponatremia for the initiation of immediate treatment in select patients. However, no conclusive evidence exists showing that hyponatremia influences the risk of SVS, and no standard treatment protocol exists for treating hyponatremia in patients with SAH. This study was undertaken to evaluate whether selective early treatment of hyponatremia prevents SVS in patients with increased urinary sodium excretion in the early phase following SAH.\n\nA total of 103 patients with aneurysmal SAH were managed for a postoperative electrolyte disorder after aneurysmal clipping or coil embolization. Between 2004 and 2007 (period 1), 54 patients started treatment to correct the electrolyte disorder after hyponatremia had occurred. Between 2007 and 2011 (period 2), 49 patients were prospectively subjected to sodium replacement treatment according to their daily sodium balance, and inhibition of natriuresis with fludrocortisone acetate was initiated just after an increase in urinary sodium excretion >300 mEq/day. The occurrence of hyponatremia, SVS, and outcomes were compared between the two periods.\n\nHyponatremia was observed in 14 patients (26%) in period 1 and 7 patients (14%) in period 2. The incidence of fludrocortisone acetate administration was significantly higher, and initiation of electrolyte correction was significantly earlier, in period 2 patients. We observed a significant difference in the frequency of SVS, which occurred in 10 patients (18.5%) in period 1 and 3 patients (6.1%) in period 2. Both urinary sodium excretion and urine volume at day 7 were significantly different between the two periods. However, no significant difference was observed in overall outcome between the two periods.",
        "Elderly patients with pneumonia have a high mortality rate. Since Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling is involved in the inflammatory response, we conducted a prospective observational case-control study to assess the relationships of TLR2 and TLR4 mortality with elderly patients with pneumonia.\n\nClinical and laboratory data were collected from these elderly patients with pneumonia (patient group; n = 40) and healthy age-matched subjects (control 1; n = 20). TLR2 and TLR4 expression levels on blood monocytes were examined, and inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) plasma concentrations were analyzed.\n\nIncreased TLR2 and TLR4 expression levels were detected in elderly patients with severe pneumonia compared with healthy subjects. Furthermore, we observed a positive correlation between TLR2 and TLR4 expression levels and IL-1 and IL-6 levels, and TLR2- and TLR4-positive cell percent expressions correlated with TNF-\u03b1 levels. By day 28 of observation, the mortality rate of the patient group was 30%. Decreased TLR2 and TLR4 expression was observed in deceased patients compared with survivors. APACHE (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) II scores and CURB-65 scores (Confusion, blood Urea nitrogen, Respiratory rate and low Blood pressure scores) were lower in survivors.",
        "We aimed to evaluate the predictability of short-term (5 days) changes in epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) gene expression for long-term (12 weeks) changes induced by high-fat diet (HFD) feeding.\n\nMice were fed semisynthetic diets containing 10 (low-fat diet) or 40 (HFD) energy% of fat. Global gene expression in eWAT was analyzed using microarrays and confirmed by quantitative PCR. As expected, HFD feeding resulted in increased body fat accumulation and reduced glucose tolerance after 12 weeks. A total of 4678 transcripts were significantly changed by HFD after 12 weeks and 973 after 5 days, with an overlap of 764 transcripts encoding 549 genes. Of these, 79% were downregulated and 21% were upregulated by HFD, all in the same direction and highly correlated (r(2) = 0.90) between the time points. Pathway analysis showed downregulation of the main identified processes: lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation. Mest (mesoderm-specific transcript) was highly upregulated, confirming its role as an early marker of fat cell expansion.",
        "The study aimed to determine whether nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an independent risk factor of adenoma after negative baseline colonoscopy.\n\nA retrospective cohort study was conducted on 1522 health-check individuals who underwent two consecutive colonoscopies at Taipei Veterans General Hospital between 2003 and 2010. Those developing an adenoma after an initial negative baseline colonoscopy (adenoma group) were compared with those in whom the second colonoscopy was negative (nonadenoma group). Anthropometric measurements, biochemical tests and the presence of NAFLD were compared between the two groups.\n\nThe adenoma group had a higher prevalence of NAFLD than the nonadenoma group (55.6% vs 38.8%; P\\xa0<\\xa00.05). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, NAFLD was an independent risk factor (OR\\xa0=\\xa01.45, 95% CI: 1.07-1.98) for adenoma formation after a negative baseline colonoscopy. The risk of colorectal adenoma increased when NAFLD patients had other morbidities including metabolic syndrome, hypertension or smoking (OR\\xa0=\\xa02.85, 4.03 and 4.17).",

        "The objective of this study was to confirm the renal protective effect of remifentanil-based anesthesia in perioperative adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).\n\nA total of 90 non-dialysis perioperative adult patients with CKD, with preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate from creatinine (eGFRcreat) values of lower than 50\\xa0ml/min/1.73\\xa0m(2), who had undergone orthopedic surgery under general anesthesia were retrospectively selected. The subjects were divided into two groups according to whether or not remifentanil was used for anesthesia management: group R, in which remifentanil was used for anesthesia management (n\\xa0=\\xa045), and group NR, in which remifentanil was not used for anesthesia (n\\xa0=\\xa045). eGFRcreat was measured pre-surgery (pre), 7\\xa0days after surgery (day-7), and 14\\xa0days after surgery (day-14).\n\nIn group R, both day-7 eGFRcreat (52.2\\xa0\u00b1\\xa017.0\\xa0ml/min/1.73\\xa0m(2)) and day-14 eGFRcreat (49.7\\xa0\u00b1\\xa015.5\\xa0ml/min/1.73\\xa0m(2)) were significantly higher than the pre eGFRcreat (40.7\\xa0\u00b1\\xa07.5\\xa0ml/min/1.73\\xa0m(2)) (day-7: p\\xa0<\\xa00.01; day-14: p\\xa0<\\xa00.01).

        "Venous thromboembolic (VTE) disease has a high incidence following trauma, but debate remains regarding optimal prophylaxis. Thrombelastography (TEG) has been suggested to be optimal in guiding prophylaxis. Thus, we designed a phase II randomized controlled trial to test the hypothesis that TEG-guided prophylaxis with escalating low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH), followed by antiplatelet therapy would reduce VTE incidence.\n\nSurgical intensive care unit trauma patients (n = 50) were randomized to receive 5,000 IU of LMWH daily (control) or to TEG-guided prophylaxis, up to 5,000 IU twice daily with the addition of aspirin, and were followed up for 5 days. In vitro studies were also conducted in which apheresis platelets were added to blood from healthy volunteers (n = 10).\n\nControl (n = 25) and TEG-guided prophylaxis (n = 25) groups were similar in age, body mass index, Injury Severity Score, and male sex. Fibrinogen levels and platelet counts did not differ, and increased LMWH did not affect clot strength between the control and study groups. The correlation of clot strength (G value) with fibrinogen was stronger on Days 1 and 2 but was superseded by platelet count on Days 3, 4, and 5. There was also a trend in increased platelet contribution to clot strength in patients receiving increased LMWH. In vitro studies demonstrated apheresis platelets significantly increased clot strength (7.19 \u00b1 0.35 to 10.34 \u00b1 0.29), as well as thrombus generation (713.86 \u00b1 12.19 to 814.42 \u00b1 7.97) and fibrin production (274.03 \u00b1 15.82 to 427.95 \u00b1 16.58).",
        "The relationship between dilution caused by fluid resuscitation and blood coagulability during ongoing, uncontrolled hemorrhagic shock (UHS) remains unclear. We hypothesized that dilution caused by fluid resuscitation may impair blood coagulability in UHS.\n\nEighteen rats underwent under halothane anesthesia. The UHS model consisted of the following phases: (1) an initial blood withdrawal of 2.5 mL per 100 g during 15 minutes, followed by UHS via tail amputation and fluid resuscitation with lactated Ringer\"s (LR) solution (0-60 minutes); (2) hemostasis and reinfusion of withdrawn blood and additional LR solution (60-100 minutes); and (3) observation of awake rats for 72 hours. Rats were randomized into three resuscitation regimens (n = 6 per group) during Phase I. LR solution was infused at a rate of 0.1 mL/min in Group 1, 0.25 mL/min in Group 2, and 0.75 mL/min in Group 3. Blood coagulability was assessed with a Sonoclot analysis, and survival to 72 hours were compared between groups.\n\nBoth resuscitation regimens of Groups 2 and 3 increased the blood pressure and bleeding volume from the tail stump compared with Group 1 (p < 0.05). At the end of Phase I, the hematocrit decreased to 29% (3%) in Group 1, 23% (3%) in Group 2, and 12% (3%) in Group 3 (p < 0.05). Sonoclot analysis revealed a decreased clot rate of 16 (9) clot signal per minute in Group 2 and 14 (10) clot signal per minute in Group 3 compared with Group 1 (40 [10] clot signal per minute; p < 0.01). There was a significant correlation between clot rate and hematocrit values (r = +0.67, p < 0.01). Compared with Group 1, survival improved in Groups 2 and 3 (p < 0.05).",
        "The purpose of this study was to assess patient-specific organ doses and cancer risk with 3D-rotational acquisitions versus the current standard of multiple single-plane coronary angiography (CA).\n\nCatheter-based CA remains one of the most commonly performed diagnostic invasive procedures delivering a relatively high radiation dose to the patient. With the introduction of flat-panel technology, three-dimensional rotational angiography became an alternative for the conventional two-dimensional angiography. However, limited information is available on the difference in patient radiation exposure with both acquisition techniques.\n\nEighty adult patients (45 males, age 38-93 years) were randomly assigned to the rotational or standard angiography group. Exposure parameters were registered and skin dose distribution was measured during the procedure. Patient-specific organ doses and related cancer risks were assessed with dedicated software.\n\nRotational angiograms were associated with 33% lower KAP-values (decrease from 49.99 Gycm(2) to 33.37 Gycm(2), P < 0.001). A significant (P < 0.001) lower peak skin dose was measured with rotational acquisitions (80 mGy, median) versus planar imaging (172 mGy, median). Moreover, the skin dose was smoothed over the whole chest of the patient. Contrast medium consumption decreased from 104 mL to 73 mL (P < 0.001) with the use of 3D-imaging. The reduction in radiation exposure resulted in a corresponding decrease of organ doses. The latter contributed to an overall cancer risk reduction of 21% for males and 50% for females.",
        "The purpose of this study was to determine the utility of individual clinical parameters as well as a composite index like the Blatchford score in predicting the need for endoscopic intervention and prognosticating the out come in patients with Mallory Weiss tear presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding.\n\nWe retrospectively reviewed our endoscopy database and our EMR system to identify patients with Mallory Weiss tear and collect relevant data.\n\nA total of 38 cases with Mallory-Weiss tear were identified at our center over a 5 year period. Thirty-two patients presented with gastrointestinal bleeding constituting 3.1% of all cases presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Nine (28%) of 32 patients were found to have active bleeding or stigmata of recent bleeding at endoscopy and required endoscopic therapy. The Blatchford score ranged from 0 to 11 in the patients with gastrointestinal bleeding. Nine patients had a Blatchford score < 6 (four 0, five 1-4) while 23 patients had a score > 6. None of the patients with a score < 6 required endoscopic intervention or a blood transfusion while 9 (39%) patients with a score > 6 required endoscopic intervention and 17 (74%) required a blood transfusion. Length of stay was significantly longer in patients with a score > 6.",
        "Zoledronic acid (Zol) is a potent inhibitor of farnesyl-pyrophosphate synthase with broad clinical use in the treatment of osteoporosis, and bone metastases. We have previously shown that encapsulation of Zol in liposomes targeted to the folate receptor (FR) greatly enhances its in vitro cytotoxicity. To examine whether targeted liposomal delivery of Zol could be a useful therapeutic approach, we investigated here the in vivo pharmacology of i.v. administered liposomal Zol (L-Zol) in murine models.\n\nZol was passively entrapped in the water phase of liposomes containing a small fraction of either dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylglycerol (DPPG) or a polyethylene-glycol (PEG)-conjugated phospholipid with or without insertion of a folate lipophilic conjugate. Radiolabeled formulations were used for pharmacokinetic (PK) and biodistribution studies. Toxicity was evaluated by clinical, hematological, biochemical, and histopathological parameters. Therapeutic studies comparing free Zol, nontargeted and folate targeted L-Zol were performed in FR-expressing human tumor models.\n\nEncapsulation of Zol in liposomes resulted in major PK changes including sustained high plasma levels and very slow clearance. DPPG-L-Zol was cleared faster than PEG-L-Zol. Grafting of folate lipophilic conjugates on liposomes further accelerated the clearance of Zol. L-Zol caused a major shift in drug tissue distribution when compared to free Zol, with a major increase (20 to 100-fold) in liver and spleen, a substantial increase (7 to 10-fold) in tumor, and a modest increase (2-fold) in bone. Liposomal formulations proved to be highly toxic, up to 50-fold more than free Zol. PEG-L-Zol was more toxic than DPPG-L-Zol. Toxicity was non-cumulative and appears to involve macrophage/monocyte activation and release of cytokines. Co-injection of L-Zol with a large dose of blank liposomes, or injection of a very low Zol-to-phospholipid ratio liposome formulation reduced toxicity by 2-4-fold suggesting that diluting macrophage exposure below a threshold Zol concentration is important to overcome toxicity. L-Zol failed to significantly enhance the therapeutic activity of Zol vis-\u00e0-vis free ZOL and doxorubicin. Folate-targeted L-Zol was marginally better than other treatment modalities in the KB tumor model but toxic deaths greatly affected the outcome.",
        "Little is known of the effect of body composition on glucose metabolism in the aging female non-human primate. These variables in older female Rhesus macaques were studied.\n\nFemale Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta, n = 19, age range 23-30 years) underwent magnetic resonance imaging and (1) H spectroscopy to quantify total abdominal fat, visceral fat (VF), subcutaneous fat (SF) area, extramyocellular lipid (EMCL), intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) and intrahepatic lipid (IHL) content, and DEXA scan for whole body composition. A subgroup (n = 12) underwent a fasting blood draw and intravenous glucose tolerance test.\n\nSF correlated with homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMAIR ) and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI), but not after adjustment for fat mass. IHL demonstrated the strongest correlation with HOMAIR , QUICKI and calculated insulin sensitivity index (CSI ), and remained significant after adjustment for fat mass. VF, IMCL, and EMCL did not correlate with any of our measures of insulin sensitivity.",
        "It is widely believed that glucocorticoids cause insulin resistance in all tissues. We have previously demonstrated that glucocorticoids cause insulin sensitization in human adipose tissue in vitro and induce insulin resistance in skeletal muscle.\n\nOur aim was to determine whether glucocorticoids have tissue-specific effects on insulin sensitivity in vivo.\n\nFifteen healthy volunteers were recruited into a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study, receiving both an overnight hydrocortisone and saline infusion. The tissue-specific actions of insulin were determined using paired 2-step hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamps incorporating stable isotopes with concomitant adipose tissue microdialysis.\n\nThe study was performed in the Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, United Kingdom.\n\nThe sensitivity of sc adipose tissue to insulin action was measured.\n\nHydrocortisone induced systemic insulin resistance but failed to cause sc adipose tissue insulin resistance as measured by suppression of adipose tissue lipolysis and enhanced insulin-stimulated pyruvate generation. In primary cultures of human hepatocytes, glucocorticoids increased insulin-stimulated p-ser473akt/protein kinase B. Similarly, glucocorticoids enhanced insulin-stimulated p-ser473akt/protein kinase B and increased Insulin receptor substrate 2 mRNA expression in sc, but not omental, intact human adipocytes, suggesting a depot-specificity of action.",
        "Despite little evidence to suggest that HPA axis responses to psychological provocation are attenuated during pregnancy, it is widely held that dampening of the HPA axis response to psychological distress serves a protective function for the mother and fetus. The current study was designed to assess changes in biobehavioral coherence between psychological distress and cortisol over the course of pregnancy.\n\nAmbulatory assessment of ecologically relevant psychological distress and salivary cortisol were repeated in all three trimesters for 82 pregnant women. Samples were collected 5 times per day over the course of 2 days in each trimester.\n\nPsychological distress and cortisol were positively associated, \u03b2=.024, p<.01, indicating that increases in psychological distress were associated with increases in cortisol. Gestational age did not moderate this association, \u03b2=.0009, p=.13, suggesting that negative psychological experiences remain potent stimuli for the HPA axis during pregnancy.",
        "Obesity impacts outcome in women with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), although its exact role and the molecular mechanisms remain poorly defined. Adipocytes secrete leptin and adiponectin, and the leptin to adiponectin (L:A) ratio is correlated with poor survival in other malignancies. We hypothesized that the L:A ratio is associated with survival in women with EOC.\n\nWe queried the institutional tumor registry for patients with advanced stage EOC and identified a cohort of 161 women with banked fasting prediagnostic serum samples. Patients underwent cytoredutive surgery followed by platinum-based chemotherapy. Sera were assayed for leptin and adiponectin, and clinico-pathologic data were abstracted. Standard statistical tests were performed.\n\n161 patients met inclusion criteria. We identified a significant correlation between BMI and leptin and the L:A ratio, but not adiponectin, in this cohort (r=0.46, 0.46, and -0.13, respectively; p=0.001, 0.001, and 0.106). Women with low L:A ratios demonstrated statistically longer disease-specific survival (57 months) compared to those with median or high levels (49 and 37 months, respectively; p=0.02). On multivariate analysis, we determined that BMI and age, but not L:A ratio, retained significance as independent prognostic factors for survival (p=0.04, 0.004, and 0.895, respectively).",
        "The aim of this study is to investigate difference of antiangiogenesis ablility and interaction about bevacizumab and endostatin in vivo in lung cancer animal model.\n\nFirst, we construct a Balb/c mice model with A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell. Then, we divide the mice into four groups randomly. Every group has six mice.\n\nmice injected with normal saline every day aroud the tumor. Endostatin group: mice injected with endostatin (Recombinant endostatin) injection (3 mg/kg) every day Peritumoral. Bevacizumab group: mice injected with bevacizumab twice a week (biw/5 mg/kg) Peritumoral. Combing group: mice were injected with endostatin and bevacizumab (dose just like single drug group). After 16 days, we executed mice and got the tumor tissue for next analysis.\n\nBased on this experiment, we found bevacizumab and endostatin expressed the ability for inhibiting tumor growth in vivo. Bevacizumab was more powerful (52.36% vs 38.68%). Combining bevacizumab with endostatin could get better results (64.15%) than single drug did. Bevacizumab played the role by inhibiting VEGF-A expression (60.8%). Endostatin took effect by inhibiting VEGF-A/C (14.6%, 30.3%). Combining group present better antitumor efficacy than any single drug group did. (79.7%, 44.2%).",
        "In the present study, we investigated whether the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-activated protein kinase A (PKA) pathway may regulate the expression of AR and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and whether there is a correlation between the expression of cAMP/PKA-associated genes and androgen receptor (AR) in patients with prostate cancer (CaP).\n\nThe functional studies were performed in LNCaP and PC3 cell lines. Data on the mRNA expression of sets of genes in human clinical samples, including prostate tissues from organ donors, prostate primary cancer, and metastatic cancer, were extracted from the National Center for Biotechnology Informations Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Statistical tests were applied.\n\nWe showed that elevated levels of cAMP/PKA pathways induced an increased expression of AR and PSA proteins in LNCaP cells in the absence of androgen. A cAMP-associated phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitor, rolipram induced an up-regulation in AR expression, whereas a cAMP enhancer, forskolin increased PSA level without affecting AR expression. Forskolin treatment increased the level of PKA R1\u03b1 in LNCaP cells, but remarkably inhibited R1\u03b1 expression in aggressive PC3 cells. In patients with CaP, we found that the expression of genes encoding R1\u03b1 and phosphodiesterase-4B was statistically significantly lower in the metastatic specimens than that in the primary CaP specimens or in the normal prostate tissues (P<0.01) and was reversely correlated with AR expression. Conversely, AR and PRKAR2B mRNA expressions were significantly higher in metastatic lesions than those in the primary CaP specimens or in the normal prostate tissues (P<0.01).",
        "In treating pancreatic cancer, there is no clearly defined optimal sequence of chemotherapy, radiation therapy and surgery. Therefore, cost-effectiveness should be considered. The objective of this study was to compare cost and outcomes between a surgery-first approach versus neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery for resectable pancreatic head cancer.\n\nA decision analytic model was constructed to compare the 2 approaches. Data from the National Cancer Database, National Surgical Quality Improvement Program, and literature populated the surgery-first arm. Data from our prospectively maintained institutional pancreatic cancer database populated the neoadjuvant arm. Costs were estimated by Medicare payment (2011 U.S. dollars). Survival was reported in quality-adjusted life-months (QALMs).\n\nThe neoadjuvant chemoradiation arm consisted of 164 patients who completed preoperative therapy. Of these, 36 (22 %) did not proceed to surgery; 12 (7 %) underwent laparotomy but had unresectable disease; and 116 (71 %) underwent definitive resection. The surgery-first approach cost $46,830 and yielded survival of 8.7 QALMs; the neoadjuvant chemoradiation approach cost $36,583 and yielded survival of 18.8 QALMs. In the neoadjuvant arm, costs and survival times for patients not undergoing surgery, those with unresectable disease at laparotomy, and those completing surgery were $12,401 and 7.7 QALMs, $20,380 and 7.1 QALMs, and $45,673 and 23.4 QALMs, respectively.",
        "Parenteral nutrition (PN) increases risks of infections in critically injured patients. Recently, PN was shown to reduce intestine luminal levels of the Paneth cell antimicrobial molecule secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) and the goblet cell glycoprotein mucin2 (MUC2). These molecules are critical factors for innate mucosal immunity and provide barrier protection. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-13 regulate sPLA2 and MUC2 production through the IL-13 receptor. Because IL-25 stimulates IL-4 and IL-13 release and PN reduces luminal sPLA2 and MUC2, we hypothesized that adding IL-25 to PN would restore these innate immune factors and maintain barrier function.\n\nTwo days after venous cannulation, male ICR (Institute of Cancer Research) mice were randomized to receive chow (n = 12), PN (n = 9), or PN + 0.7 \u03bcg of exogenous IL-25 (n = 11) daily for 5 days. Small-intestine wash fluid (SIWF) was collected for analysis of sPLA2 activity, MUC2 density, and luminal levels of IL-4 and IL-13. Small-intestinal tissue was harvested for analysis of tissue sPLA2 activity or immediate use in an ex-vivo intestinal segment culture (EVISC) to assess susceptibility of the tissue segments to enteroinvasive Escherichia coli.\n\nPN reduced luminal sPLA2 (P < 0.0001) and MUC2 (P <0.002) compared with chow, whereas the addition of IL-25 to PN increased luminal sPLA2 (P < 0.0001) and MUC2 (P < 0.02) compared with PN. Tissue IL-4 and IL-13 decreased with PN compared with chow (IL-4: P < 0.0001, IL-13: P < 0.002), whereas IL-25 increased both cytokines compared with PN (IL-4: P < 0.03, IL-13: P < 0.02). Tissue levels of sPLA2 were significantly decreased with PN compared with chow, whereas IL-25 significantly increased tissue sPLA2 levels compared with PN alone. Functionally, more bacteria invaded the PN-treated tissue compared with chow (P < 0.01), and the addition of IL-25 to PN decreased enteroinvasion to chow levels (P < 0.01).",
        "Recently, sildenafil was reported to be an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp/ABCB1) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2) in vitro. We have now investigated the in vivo potency of sildenafil.\n\nBy using wild-type and Abcb1; Abcg2 knockout mice we have investigated the effect of sildenafil on the brain penetration of two substrate drugs (docetaxel and topotecan). Next we have investigated if sildenafil was able to improve the efficacy of doxorubicin against P-glycoprotein expressing CT26 colon cancer cells in syngeneic Balb/c mice.\n\nSildenafil administered orally at a dose of 50mg/kg did not improve the brain penetration of docetaxel and topotecan, although the plasma level of sildenafil was already much higher than can be achieved in humans. On the other hand, sildenafil increased the plasma levels of the cytotoxic drugs, but not by inhibition of Abcb1 or Abcg2, since this effect was also seen in Abcb1;Abcg2 knockout mice. The brain penetration of sildenafil was more than 20-fold higher in Abcb1;Abcg2 mice versus wild-type mice, indicating that sildenafil is a good substrate of the two transporters. Sildenafil was also not able to improve the efficacy of doxorubicin against subcutaneous CT26 tumours. The doxorubicin level in tumour tissue did increase, but so did the concentration of doxorubicin in plasma and heart.",
        "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of oral tamoxifen treatment on the number of myofibroblasts present during the healing process after experimental bile duct injury.\n\nThe sample consisted of 16 pigs that were divided into two groups (the control and study groups). Incisions and suturing of the bile ducts were performed in the two groups. Tamoxifen (20 mg/day) was administered only to the study group. The animals were sacrificed after 30 days. Quantification of myofibroblasts in the biliary ducts was made through immunohistochemistry analysis using anti-alpha smooth muscle actin of the smooth muscle antibody. Immunohistochemical quantification was performed using a digital image system.\n\nIn the animals treated with tamoxifen (20 mg/day), there was a significant reduction in immunostaining for alpha smooth muscle actin compared with the control group (0.1155 vs. 0.2021, p = 0.046).",
        "Oxidative stress plays an important role in skeletal muscle damage in sepsis. Aerobic exercise can decrease oxidative stress and enhance antioxidant defenses. Therefore, it was hypothesized that aerobic exercise training before a sepsis stimulus could attenuate skeletal muscle damage by modulating oxidative stress. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of aerobic physical preconditioning on the different mechanisms that are involved in sepsis-induced myopathy.\n\nMale Wistar rats were randomly assigned to either the untrained or trained group. The exercise training protocol consisted of an eight-week treadmill program. After the training protocol, the animals from both groups were randomly assigned to either a sham group or a cecal ligation and perforation surgery group. Thus, the groups were as follows: sham, cecal ligation and perforation, sham trained, and cecal ligation and perforation trained. Five days after surgery, the animals were euthanized and their soleus and plantaris muscles were harvested. Fiber cross-sectional area, creatine kinase, thiobarbituric acid reactive species, carbonyl, catalase and superoxide dismutase activities were measured.\n\nThe fiber cross-sectional area was smaller, and the creatine kinase, thiobarbituric acid reactive species and carbonyl levels were higher in both muscles in the cecal ligation and perforation group than in the sham and cecal ligation and perforation trained groups. The muscle superoxide dismutase activity was higher in the cecal ligation and perforation trained group than in the sham and cecal ligation and perforation groups. The muscle catalase activity was lower in the cecal ligation and perforation group than in the sham group.",
        "Circulating epithelial tumor cell (CETC) analysis is a promising diagnostic field for estimating the risk for metastatic relapse and progression in patients with malignant disease. CETCs characterization can be used as a liquid biopsy for prognostic and predictive purposes in breast and other cancers. IGF-IR and VEGFR-2 play an important role in tumor growth and the progression of cancer disease. The purpose of the current study was therefore to investigate their expression on CETCs.\n\nCETCs were determined from the blood of 50 patients suffering from breast cancer. The number of vital CETCs and the expression of IGF-IR and VEGFR-2 were investigated using the maintrac\u00ae method.\n\nIGF-IR and VEGFR-2 expression on the surface of CETCs were detected in 84% of patients. A statistically high correlation was found between IGF-IR and VEGFR-2 (r\\u200a=\\u200a0.745 and p<0.001) on the CETCs. The co-expression of both receptors was confirmed in some experiments and ranged between 70% and 100%. Statistically significant correlations were observed between the number of CETCs and IGF-IR (r\\u200a=\\u200a0.315 and p<0.05) and VEGFR-2 (r\\u200a=\\u200a0.310 and p<0.05) expression. The presence of CETCs and the level of IGF-IR and VEGFR-2 expression were not associated with tumor stage, hormone receptor status or nodal/distant metastasis.",
        "Although the association between alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and risk of type 2 diabetes is well-studied, the effects of slightly increased ALT levels within the normal range on the temporal normal glucose profile remains poorly understood.\n\nA total of 322 Chinese subjects without impaired glucose tolerance or previous diagnoses of diabetes were recruited for study from 10 hospitals in urban areas across China. All subjects wore a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system for three consecutive days. The diurnal (06\u223600-20\u223600) and nocturnal (20\u223600-06\u223600) mean blood glucose (MBG) levels were calculated. Subjects were stratified by ALT quartile level and correlation analyses were performed.\n\nThe median ALT level was 17 IU/L, and subjects with ALT \u226517 IU/L had higher nocturnal MBG level than those with ALT <17 IU/L (P<0.05). Nocturnal MBG was positively correlated with ALT levels (Pearson correlation analysis: r\\u200a=\\u200a0.187, P\\u200a=\\u200a0.001), and the correlation remained significant after correction for the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) (r\\u200a=\\u200a0.105, P\\u200a=\\u200a0.041). No correlations were found between diurnal MBG and ALT, and nocturnal or diurnal MBG and aspartate aminotransferase or gamma-glutamyltransferase (all, P>0.05). Multivariate stepwise regression analysis of elevated nocturnal MBG identified increased HOMA-IR, elevated ALT levels, and decreased homeostatic model assessment of \u00df-cell function as independent factors (all, P<0.05).",
        "Central chemoreceptors are important to detect changes of CO2/H(+), and the Locus coeruleus (LC) is one of the many putative central chemoreceptor sites. Here, we studied the contribution of LC glutamatergic receptors on ventilatory, cardiovascular and thermal responses to hypercapnia.\n\nTo this end, we determined pulmonary ventilation (V(E)), body temperatures (T(b)), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) of male Wistar rats before and after unilateral microinjection of kynurenic acid (KY, an ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonist, 10 nmol/0.1 \u03bcL) or \u03b1-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (MCPG, a metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonist, 10 nmol/0.1 \u03bcL) into the LC, followed by 60 min of air breathing or hypercapnia exposure (7% CO2).\n\nVentilatory response to hypercapnia was higher in animals treated with KY intra-LC (1918.7 \u00b1 275.4) compared with the control group (1057.8 \u00b1 213.9, P < 0.01). However, the MCPG treatment within the LC had no effect on the hypercapnia-induced hyperpnea. The cardiovascular and thermal controls were not affected by hypercapnia or by the injection of KY and MCPG in the LC.",

In Experiment 2, sexually experienced OVX rats at a different testing site received EB alone and were tested weekly with sexually active males following daily flibanserin treatment.\n\nFemale appetitive behaviors (solicitations, hops and darts, anogenital investigations), defensive behaviors, pacing, lordosis, and male copulatory responses (intromissions and ejaculations) were measured during each 30-minute copulation test.\n\nAcute flibanserin or 1 week of chronic flibanserin treatment did not modify sexual responses in fully (EB\\u2009+\\u2009P) or partially (EB-alone) primed females. After 2 weeks of chronic treatment, fully primed females displayed significantly more solicitations than the three other groups. After 3 weeks of chronic treatment, a significant increase in female solicitations was observed in both hormone-treatment groups.",
        "Aberration of miR-129-2 has been linked to a variety of human tumours. However, whether miR-129-2 is involved in hepatocarcinogenesis remains unknown. Here, we investigate the involvement of miR-129-2 in HBV infection-related HCC.\n\nA total of 75 paired tumour and their corresponding non-tumour liver tissues from HCC patients with serum HBsAg positive were collected. The methylation of miR-129-2 gene was quantitatively analysed by a DNA methylation-sensitive endonuclease digestion followed by quantitative PCR. The expression of mature miR-129-2 (miR-129-3p) was detected by Taqman RT-PCR. SOX4 expression was detected using quantitative realtime RT-PCR, western blot and immunohistochemical staining. The function of miR-129-2 was investigated using cell proliferation and clonogenicity assays in vitro.\n\nCompared with the adjacent non-tumour tissues, tumour tissues exhibited significantly increased miR-129-2 hypermethylation both in frequency (37.33% vs. 8%, P < 0.0001) and in intensity (14.77% vs. 3.08%, P = 0.002). Accordantly, miR-129-3p expression in HCC tissues was significantly lower than that in non-tumour tissues (P = 0.0461), in a manner reversely correlated with the level of miR-129-2 hypermethylation. Notably, SOX4 level in the HCC tissues was significantly higher than that in non-tumour tissues (P = 0.0174) and normal liver tissues (P = 0.0077), correlated reversely with miR-129-3p level (P = 0.0105). Furthermore, overexpression of miR-129-2 in HepG2 reduced cell proliferation and clonogenicity, while co-expression with SOX4 could partially reverse its antitumor effects. In addition, SOX4 in HepG2 cell can enhance \u03b2-catenin/TCF activity by increasing \u03b2-catenin level.",
        "To assess the utility of anterior tibial tenderness (ATT) measured by visual analogue scoring (VAS) as a clinical diagnostic tool for vitamin D deficiency in a high-risk population of Pakistani women.\n\nATT was measured by VAS in 75 premenopausal women age 17 to 56 years (mean, 41.3 years) with generalized aches and pains and calcium <11 mg/dL (normal, 8 to 11 mg/dL) who were seen at a tertiary care center in Lahore, Pakistan. This was followed by administration of 1.8 million units of vitamin D3 in divided doses. ATT, vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were checked before and after the injections. Correlation between ATT, vitamin D, and PTH, as well as changes in ATT, vitamin D, and PTH following supplementation were determined.\n\nPre-intervention average calcium and vitamin D were 9.3 mg/dL (range, 8 to 10.3 mg/dL) and 12.1 ng/mL (range, 1.5 to 32.6 ng/mL), respectively. Seventy-four percent of the participants (53/75) had vitamin D deficiency and elevated PTH (>60 pg/mL). Mean PTH was 81.6 pg/mL (range, 29.1 to 370 pg/mL). Changes in ATT correlated strongly (r = 0.422; P = .013) with changes in PTH. Following supplementation, there was significant improvement in ATT (P<.01) and vitamin D level (P<.01), with a decrease in PTH level (P<.01).",
        "Previous studies suggest elevated inflammation in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, with increased activity of the Interleukin 1 (IL-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, von Willebrand factor (vWf) and osteoprotegerin (OPG). It is unclear how immune activation is involved in the psychopathology. We investigated if elevated inflammation was associated with disease severity (trait) or current symptom level (state), comparing psychotic with general characteristics.\n\nPlasma levels of sTNF receptor 1 (sTNF-R1), IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), IL-6, vWf and OPG were measured with ELISA techniques in 322 patients with schizophrenia spectrum and bipolar disorder. Current symptom level (state) was measured with Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Disease severity (trait) was measured with premorbid adjustment scale (PAS), age at onset, number of psychotic episodes and number and length of hospitalizations.\n\nAfter controlling for confounders, IL-1Ra and TNF-R1 were independently associated with GAF, and significantly correlated with PANSS negative and positive, respectively. In addition, Il-1Ra was associated with PAS, and sTNF-R1 with number of hospitalizations and psychotic episodes. VWf was significantly correlated with psychotic episodes, OPG with hospitalizations and IL-6 with history of psychosis. Linear regression analysis showed that GAF remained associated with sTNF-R1 and IL-1Ra with PANSS, after controlling for the other clinical measures.",
        "Lysine acetylation is an important post-translational modification that plays a central role in eukaryotic transcriptional activation by modifying chromatin and transcription-related factors. Human pregnancy-specific glycoproteins (PSG) are the major secreted placental proteins expressed by the syncytiotrophoblast at the end of pregnancy and represent early markers of cytotrophoblast differentiation. Low PSG levels are associated with complicated pregnancies, thus highlighting the importance of studying the mechanisms that control their expression. Despite several transcription factors having been implicated as key regulators of PSG gene family expression; the role of protein acetylation has not been explored.\n\nHere, we explored the role of acetylation on PSG gene expression in the human placental-derived JEG-3 cell line. Pharmacological inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs) up-regulated PSG protein and mRNA expression levels, and augmented the amount of acetylated histone H3 associated with PSG 5\"regulatory regions. Moreover, PSG5 promoter activation mediated by Sp1 and KLF6, via the core promoter element motif (CPE, -147/-140), was markedly enhanced in the presence of the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA). This effect correlated with an increase in Sp1 acetylation and KLF6 nuclear localization as revealed by immunoprecipitation and subcellular fractionation assays. The co-activators PCAF, p300, and CBP enhanced Sp1-dependent PSG5 promoter activation through their histone acetylase (HAT) function. Instead, p300 and CBP acetyltransferase domain was dispensable for sustaining co-activation of PSG5 promoter by KLF6.",
        "The transpulmonary thermodilution (TPTD) technique is widely used in clinical practice for measuring cardiac output (CO). This study was designed to investigate the influence of various levels of pulmonary oedema on the reliability of CO measurements by the TPTD method.\n\nIn 11 newborn lambs pulmonary oedema was induced using a surfactant washout technique. Serial CO measurements using TPTD (CO(TPTD)) were performed at various amounts of lung water. Simultaneously, CO was measured by an ultrasound flow probe around the main pulmonary artery (CO(MPA)) and used as the standard reference. CO was divided by the body surface area to calculate cardiac index (CI). Data were analysed using correlational statistics and Bland-Altman analysis.\n\nOne lamb died prematurely. A total of 56 measurements in 10 lambs were analysed with a median CI(MPA) of 2.95 (IQR 1.04) litre min(-1) m(-2). Mean percentage increase in extravascular lung water (EVLW) between the start and the end of the study was 126.4% (SD 40.4). Comparison of the two CO methods showed a mean bias CI of -0.16 litre min(-1) m(-2) (limits of agreement \u00b10.73 litre min(-1) m(-2)) and a percentage error of 23.8%. Intraclass correlation coefficients were 0.91 (95% CI 0.81-0.95) for absolute agreement and 0.92 (95% CI 0.87-0.95) for consistency. Acceptable agreement was confirmed by a tolerability-agreement ratio of 0.39. The within-subject correlation between the amount of EVLWI and the bias between the two methods was not significant (-0.02; P=0.91).",
        "The role of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway, and mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore in atorvastatin-induced cardioprotection were examined in human myocardium, in vitro.\n\nIsometric force of contraction of human right atrial trabeculae was recorded during 30-min hypoxia and 60-min reoxygenation (control) and in the presence of atorvastatin (0.1 \u00b5M, 1 \u00b5M, 10 \u00b5M). In early reoxygenation, the TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor, AG490 (inhibitor of JAK/STAT), or atractyloside (mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore opener), were administered. Cyclosporine A (inhibitor of mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore opening) was administered during the first minute of reoxygenation alone or in presence of atorvastatin and TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor or AG490. The force of contraction (percentage of baseline) at the end of reoxygenation period was compared (mean \u00b1 SD; n = 6 in each group). Protein expression of JAK/STAT pathway was measured using Western immunoblotting.\n\nAtorvastatin 0.1 \u00b5M (70 \u00b1 9%), 1 \u00b5M (85 \u00b1 5%), 10 \u00b5M (89 \u00b1 5%), and Cyclosporine A (87 \u00b1 10%) improved the recovery of force of contraction at the end of reoxygenation, as compared with control (50 \u00b1 3%). Atorvastatin 1 \u00b5M (4.64 \u00b1 2.90 ng \u00b7 ml(-1) \u00b7 g(-1) of tissue) decreased the release of troponin Ic after hypoxia-reoxygenation (control: 26.34 \u00b1 19.30 ng \u00b7 ml(-1) \u00b7 g(-1); P < 0.001). The enhanced recovery of force of contraction after atorvastatin administration was abolished by TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor (53 \u00b1 8%), AG490 (56 \u00b1 7%), atractyloside (48 \u00b1 8%). Cyclosporine A restored the atorvastatin-induced cardioprotection abolished by TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor (87 \u00b1 6%) and AG490 (83 \u00b1 9%). Atorvastatin significantly increased the phosphorylation of JAK-2 and STAT-3, TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor abolished the enhanced phosphorylation of JAK-2 and STAT-3 by atorvastatin.",
        "Very little is known regarding correlation of micro RNA (miR)-106a with clinical outcomes of patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). This study determined whether miR-106a could be used as an independent prognostic biomarker in those patients.\n\nA total of 156 GBM patients were divided into 2 cohorts. In the first cohort, matched fresh frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples were collected from 24 GBM patients, while in the second cohort, only FFPE samples were collected from 132 GBM patients. MiR-106a expression levels were examined by quantitative real-time PCR in the 2 cohorts and further validated by in situ hybridization assay in the second cohort. The correlation between miR-106a expression levels and overall survival was evaluated in the second cohort of 114 GBM patients available for follow-up by a log-rank test and a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model.\n\nOur data showed a very good correlation of miR-106a or U6 expression between fresh frozen and FFPE GBM specimens, with Pearson\"s correlation coefficients of 0.849 and 0.823, respectively (P < .001). Their expression levels in archival FFPE samples were quite stable for at least 7 years when stored at room temperature. Multivariate analysis revealed that the expression level of miR-106a was an independent and significant predictor of overall survival in GBM patients (P = .011).",
        "As a calcineurin inhibitor in T-cell activation, cyclosporine A (CsA) has provided the pharmacologic foundation for organ transplantation. We have previously demonstrated that CsA promotes trophoblast growth and invasion in vitro. Here, we further investigated the regulation of CsA on trophoblast migration and the intracellular signaling pathways involved.\n\nWe evaluated the migration of human primary trophoblasts by using transwell migration assay. CsA-mediated induction of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) was evaluated by cotransfection with luciferase reporter constructs and luciferase activity assays.\n\nTreatment with CsA-promoted migration of primary trophoblasts and the HTR8 cell line in a dose-dependent manner. CsA also increased NF-\u03baB-transcriptional activity in trophoblasts in time- and dose-dependent manners. Pharmacologically inhibiting mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 signaling with U0126 attenuated the CsA-induced cell migration and NF-\u03baB activity in trophoblasts. Furthermore, pretreatment with PDTC, a specific NF-\u03baB inhibitor, inhibited the CsA-induced migration of trophoblasts in dose-dependent manners. Although NFAT activation by ionomycin via calcineurin is accompanied by increased transactivation of NF-\u03baB, pretreatment with the NFAT inhibitor did not affect NF-\u03baB-transcriptional activity. Interestingly, ionomycin and CsA synergize to transactivate NF-\u03baB. Ionomycin-inhibited basal migration of trophoblasts, and pretreatment with CsA reversed the ionomycin-inhibited trophoblast migration. However, the NFAT inhibitor increased basal migration, but not CsA-induced migration, of trophoblasts.",
        "Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization is consistently rising. The question whether the MRSA colonization places the patients at higher risk, requiring higher levels of care when being admitted, has never been studied. We conducted this study to determine the impact of MRSA colonization status on the required level of care upon admission to hospital.\n\nWe conducted a retrospective chart review in 1000 plus-bed tertiary care academic institute. Our study population composed of all the patients who were admitted from January 2011 to March 2011. We found 7413 pediatric admissions that were identified as the study subjects. We assessed and divided study subjects into 2 groups, MRSA colonized and MRSA noncolonized. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-colonized patients were further grouped into those admitted to either pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) or ward, and these 2 groups were analyzed using P value, Fisher exact test, relative risks, and odds ratios.\n\nWe found a total of 7413 admissions, 753 were admitted in PICU (average pediatric risk of mortality score 18), and 6660 were admitted in pediatric wards (average pediatric risk of mortality score, 5). We found that MRSA colonization was 20 (2.66%) of 753 in PICU admissions and 155 (2.33%) of 6660 in ward admissions. We found that rate of admissions difference between MRSA colonized and MRSA noncolonized groups was clinically insignificant (P > .05).",
        "Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are pluripotent cells that have immunosuppressive and reparative properties in vitro and in vivo. Although autologous bone marrow (BM)-derived MSCs are already clinically tested in transplant recipients, it is unclear whether these BM cells are affected by renal disease. We assessed whether renal failure affected the function and therapeutic potential of BM-MSCs.\n\nMSCs from 10 adults with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and 10 age-matched healthy controls were expanded from BM aspirates and tested for phenotype and functionality in vitro.\n\nMSCs from ESRD patients were >90% positive for CD73, CD90 and CD105 and negative for CD34 and CD45 and showed a similar morphology and differentiation capacity as MSCs from healthy controls. Of importance for their clinical utility, growth characteristics were similar in both groups, and sufficient numbers of MSCs were obtained within 4\\xa0weeks. Messenger RNA expression levels of self-renewal genes and factors involved in repair and inflammation were also comparable between both groups. Likewise, microRNA expression profiling showed a broad overlap between ESRD and healthy donor MSCs. ESRD MSCs displayed the same immunosuppressive capacities as healthy control MSCs, demonstrated by a similar dose-dependent inhibition of peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation, similar inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interferon-\u03b3 production and a concomitant increase in the production of interleukin-10.",
        "Leakage and benign strictures occur frequently after esophagectomy. The objective of this study was to analyze the outcome of hand-sewn end-to-end versus end-to-side cervical esophagogastric anastomoses.\n\nA series of 390 consecutive patients who underwent esophagectomy with gastric conduit reconstruction was analyzed.\n\nThe end-to-end technique was performed in 112 (29\\xa0%) patients and the end-to-side in 278 (71\\xa0%) patients. Anastomotic leakage occurred in 20 (18\\xa0%) patients with an end-to-end anastomosis versus 58 (21\\xa0%) patients with an end-to-side anastomosis (p\\u2009=\\u20090.50). A higher incidence in anastomotic strictures was seen in end-to-end anastomoses (48 (43\\xa0%)) compared with end-to-side anastomoses (89 (32\\xa0%); p\\u2009=\\u20090.04). Moreover, a median of 11 (7-17) dilations was necessary in patients with a benign anastomotic stricture in the end-to-end group compared with four (2-8) dilations in patients with a benign anastomotic stricture in the end-to-end group (p\\u2009<\\u20090.036). After multivariate analysis, the difference in anastomotic leakage rates remained nonsignificant (p\\u2009=\\u20090.74), whereas anastomotic stricture rate and number of dilations were higher in the end-to-end group (p\\u2009=\\u20090.03 and p\\u2009=\\u20090.01, respectively).",
        "Pediatric adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare and highly aggressive malignancy. Conventional chemotherapeutic agents have shown limited utility and are largely ineffective in treating children with advanced ACC. The lack of cell lines and animal models of pediatric ACC has hampered the development of new therapies. Here we report the establishment of the first pediatric ACC xenograft model and the characterization of its sensitivity to selected chemotherapeutic agents.\n\nA tumor from an 11-year-old boy with previously untreated ACC was established as a subcutaneous xenograft in immunocompromised CB17 scid(-/-) mice. The patient harbored a germline TP53 G245C mutation, and the primary tumor showed loss of heterozygosity with retention of the mutated TP53 allele. Histopathology, DNA fingerprinting, gene expression profiling, and biochemical analyses of the xenograft were conducted and compared with the primary tumor and normal adrenal cortex. The second endpoint was to assess the preliminary antitumor activity of selected chemotherapeutic agents.\n\nThe xenograft maintained the histopathologic and molecular features of the primary tumor. Screening the xenograft for drug responsiveness showed that cisplatin had a potent antitumor effect. However, etoposide, doxorubicin, and a panel of other common cancer drugs had little or no antitumor activity, with the exception of topotecan, which was found to significantly inhibit tumor growth. Consistent with these preclinical findings, topotecan as a single agent in a child with relapsed ACC resulted in disease stabilization.",
        "The aim of this study was to describe baseline coagulation in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA) and its effect on survival.\n\nRetrospective study of ED, theatre and laboratory records of patients presenting with rAAA to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh ED. Patients with symptomatic aneurysms, those without an initial ED coagulation screen and those on warfarin were excluded. Major coagulopathy was defined as international normalized ratio or activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) ratio of at least 1.5 or platelet count less than 50 \u00d7 10/l.\n\nBetween 1 July 2006 and 31 March 2011, 119 patients were enrolled. Mean (\u00b1 SD) age was 76.5 \u00b1 7.6 years and male to female ratio was 2.3 : 1. Ten patients died in the ED, 20 were considered not fit for surgery and 89 went to theatre. A total of 56 survived to hospital discharge. Seventeen (14.3%) patients had a major coagulopathy; an international normalized ratio or APTT ratio of at least 1.5. No patients had platelets less than 50 \u00d7 10/l, but eight patients had platelets less than 100 \u00d7 10/l. Neither ED prothrombin time (PT) nor ED APTT was associated with survival in either the operated [P=0.167 NS (PT) and P=0.353 NS (APTT); two-sided t-test] or entire cohort [P=0.254 NS (PT) and P=0.413 NS (APTT); two-sided t-test] groups.",
        "We previously showed that B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathways are important for in vitro survival of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cells. To further identify early BCR-activated signaling pathways involved in MCL cell survival, we focused our study on BCR-proximal kinases such as LYN whose dysregulations could contribute to the aggressive course of MCL.\n\nPrimary MCL cells were isolated from 14 leukemic patients. Early BCR-induced genes were identified by qRT-PCR array. The basal and BCR-induced phosphorylation of LYN and JNK were evaluated by immunoblottting. Cell survival signals were evaluated by apoptosis using flow cytometry.\n\nWe showed that LYN was constitutively phosphorylated in MCL cell lines and in 9/10 leukemic MCL cases. Treatment with dasatinib or with a specific inhibitor of Src kinases such as PP2 suppressed constitutive LYN activation and increased in vitro spontaneous apoptosis of primary MCL cells. BCR engagement resulted in an increase of LYN phosphorylation leading to activation of c-JUN NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and over-expression of the early growth response gene-1 (EGR-1). Inhibition of JNK with SP600125 induced apoptosis and reduced level of basal and BCR-induced expression of EGR-1. Furthermore, decreasing EGR1 expression by siRNA reduced BCR-induced cell survival. Treatment with PP2 or with dasatinib suppressed BCR-induced LYN and JNK phosphorylation as well as EGR-1 upregulation and is associated with a decrease of cell survival in all cases analysed.",
        "The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and in particular cortisol, has been reported to be involved in obesity-associated metabolic disturbances in adults and in selected populations of adolescents. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between morning adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol levels and cardiovascular risk factors in overweight or obese Caucasian children and adolescents.\n\nThis cross-sectional study of 450 obese children and adolescents (aged 4 to 18 years) was performed in a tertiary referral center. ACTH, cortisol, cardiovascular risk factors (fasting and post-challenge glucose, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, triglycerides, and hypertension) and insulin resistance were evaluated. All analyses were corrected for confounding factors (sex, age, puberty, body mass index), and odds ratios were determined.\n\nACTH and cortisol levels were positively associated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides, fasting glucose and insulin resistance. Cortisol, but not ACTH, was also positively associated with LDL-cholesterol. When adjusted for confounding factors, an association between ACTH and 2 h post-oral glucose tolerance test glucose was revealed. After stratification according to cardiovascular risk factors and adjustment for possible confounding factors, ACTH levels were significantly higher in subjects with triglycerides \u226590th percentile (P <0.02) and impaired fasting glucose or glucose tolerance (P <0.001). Higher cortisol levels were found in subjects with blood pressure \u226595th percentile and LDL-cholesterol \u226590th percentile. Overall, the highest tertiles of ACTH (>5.92 pmol/l) and cortisol (>383.5 nmol/l) although within the normal range were associated with increases in cardiovascular risk factors in this population.",
        "We aimed to study vaginal fluid phosphorylated insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (phIGFBP-1) testing in early pregnancy to predict spontaneous preterm delivery (PTD).\n\nVaginal and cervical swab samples were collected from 5180 unselected women during the first-trimester (mean gestational age 13.1\\u2009weeks) ultrasound screening. PhIGFBP-1 was measured in vaginal and cervical fluid by an immunoenzymometric assay. Concentrations of \u226510\\u2009\u00b5g/L were considered elevated. The outcome measure was spontaneous PTD at <32 or <37\\u2009weeks gestation.\n\nThe median concentrations of first-trimester vaginal and cervical phIGFBP-1 were higher in women with spontaneous PTD at <32 and <37\\u2009weeks gestation. When 10\\u2009\u00b5g/L of phIGFBP-1 was used as a cut-off level, the OR in predicting PTD at <32\\u2009weeks gestation was 8.6 (95% CI 3.6-20.7) for vaginal samples and 3.6 (95% CI 1.7-7.9) for cervical samples. At <37\\u2009weeks gestation, the OR in predicting PTD was 3.0 (95% CI 1.9-3.9) for vaginal samples and 1.9 (95% CI 1.4-2.5) for cervical samples. In multiple logistic regression analysis, both elevated vaginal and cervical fluid phIGFBP-1 levels were independent predictors of PTD both at <32 and <37\\u2009weeks gestation.",
        "The natural history of insulation defects with inside-out conductor externalization in recalled St Jude Medical Riata defibrillator leads is not well understood.\n\nTo determine the prevalence of externalization in a nationwide screening. Secondary aims were to examine time dependence and location of externalization, association with electrical failure, and fluoroscopic diagnostic performance.\n\nAll 299 patients with recalled Riata leads in Denmark were identified, and all except one underwent fluoroscopy and device interrogation. Externalizations were confirmed by multiple investigators.\n\nThe prevalence of externalization was 32 of 298 (11%) at a mean dwell time of 5.1 years. The prevalence was 21 of 98 (21%) for 8-F leads and 11 of 200 (6%) for 7-F leads; however, 8-F leads had longer dwell times. The degree of externalization was correlated with dwell time (Spearman\"s \u03c1 = .37; P = .03). Externalization more often included the lead segment below the tricuspid annulus in dual coil leads than in single coil leads (69% vs 16%; P = .004). No association was observed between externalization and electrical function. Fluoroscopic diagnostic performance was good with positive and negative predictive values of 88% and 99%, respectively.",
        "The present study aims to investigate the relevance of immunohistochemical p53 expression in carcinomas of the oral cavity and of the head and neck region. Long-term clinical and histopathological follow-up findings as well as HPV status are correlated with the results of this examination.\n\nSections made from two tissue arrays composed of 222 oral squamous cell carcinomas and 427 squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck region, respectively, were examined for p53 expression and Ki-67 index by means of immunohistochemistry. Correlation of long-term clinical findings of the patients and pathological features of tumours with laboratory results were examined statistically.\n\nNo significant correlation was found between the p53 immunohistochemical expression in the 207 oral carcinomas and features of the tumours and patient outcomes. There was no significant association between the Ki-67 labelling index and the p53 expression.",
        "Formic acid has recently been detected in maternal blood and umbilical cord blood of infants born to alcohol abusing mothers. This toxic metabolite of methanol requires folate for detoxification. We hypothesized that formic acid produced in the maternal circulation will transfer across the placenta and will be toxic to the placenta. Our objectives were, first, to determine whether formic acid transfers across the human placenta and whether it is toxic to the placenta and second, to determine whether folate can decrease transplacental transfer of formic acid and mitigate toxicity.\n\nDual perfusion of a single placental lobule ex vivo was used to characterize the transfer of formic acid across the placenta. After a 1-h control period, formic acid (2 mM) was introduced into the maternal circulation with (n = 4) or without folate (1 \u00b5M) (n = 4) and was allowed to equilibrate for 3 h.\n\nFormic acid transferred rapidly from the maternal to the fetal circulation, and transfer was not altered with the addition of folate. Compared with the control period, there was a significant decrease in hCG secretion (P = 0.03) after addition of formic acid. The addition of folic acid to the perfusate mitigated the decrease in hCG.",
        "The renin-angiotensin system peptides are critically involved in the regulation of endothelial function with important pathological implications. Angiotensin (Ang) 1-7 has many beneficial effects in the vasculature that modulate the cardiovascular risk. Here, we tested the hypothesis that Ang 1-7 has a protective role against the endothelial defects associated with diet-induced obesity (DIO) in mice.\n\nAng 1-7 (with or without Ang II) was delivered subcutaneously for 4 weeks using osmotic minipumps. Vascular studies were performed using aortic rings. Arterial pressure and heart rate were measured in separate cohorts of mice by telemetry.\n\nFirst, we examined whether chronic administration of Ang 1-7 improves the vascular dysfunctions caused by Ang II. Subcutaneous coinfusion of Ang 1-7 significantly attenuates Ang II-induced endothelial dysfunctions. In addition, DIO mice have significant impairment in the endothelium-dependent relaxation. The contractile responses induced by various stimuli, including serotonin and endothelin-1, were differentially altered in DIO mice. Notably, DIO mice treated with Ang 1-7 for 4 weeks displayed significant improvement in the endothelial function as indicated by the increased acetylcholine-induced relaxation. Consistent with this, chronic treatment with Ang 1-7 reversed the increased aortic expression of NAD(P)H oxidase subunits (p22(phox) and p47(phox)) and plasma TBARS associated with DIO mice. In contrast, treatment with Ang 1-7 did not normalize the altered contractions associated with DIO mice.",
        "Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a common and severe complication following femoral neck fractures in young adults. Despite significant advances in surgical techniques, radiological evaluation and comprehensive treatment for the prevention of ONFH, the incidence of traumatic ONFH has remained unchanged at approximately 20% in recent decades. The injury-to-surgery interval is considered as a principal factor affecting the occurrence of ONFH, and traditionally, femoral neck fractures are treated emergently. However, the relationship between the injury-to-surgery interval and ONFH occurrence is poorly understood, and previous reviews have not provided a precise explanation due to the lack of strict selection criteria for studies.\n\nWe reviewed previously published articles and included in current systematic review those studies with accurate multivariate analyses that included age, fracture type, operation method, follow-up, ONFH occurrence and injury-to-surgery interval.\n\nSix case studies were included and reevaluated. The studies included 263 hips for final analysis, with an overall incidence of postfracture ONFH of 17.5%. Patients were categorized into groups of less/more than 8\\xa0h, less/more than 24\\xa0h, less/more than 48\\xa0h and less/more than 3\\xa0weeks based on the individual injury-to-surgery interval. The postfracture ONFH incidence ranged from 13.3% (<8\\xa0weeks) to 21.7% (>3\\xa0weeks). Operations performed within 3\\xa0weeks of injury resulted in a lower ONFH incidence compared with operations performed after 3\\xa0weeks; however, this difference was not statistically significant. The ONFH incidence remained relatively stable when the operations were performed within 3\\xa0weeks of injury.",
        "Many previous studies have focused on the postoperative complication of postoperative knee pain, infection, knee prosthesis loosening, periprosthetic fractures, and so on. There have been few studies focused on postoperative ecchymosis formation surrounding the wound of the TKA site. A certain degree of effect on the early functional recovery of the patients may occur due to the mental stress caused by the ecchymosis, which raises doubts regarding the success of the surgery. Therefore, it is particularly important to understand the risk factors for postsurgical ecchymosis formation after TKA, and specific measures for preventing ecchymosis should be taken. In this study, we reviewed the record of patients who received TKAs in our hospital, and a comprehensive analysis and assessment was conducted regarding 15 clinical factors causing postsurgical ecchymosis formation.\n\nThe records of 102 patients who received unilateral TKAs between January 2007 and May 2010 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into two groups based on the occurrence of ecchymosis.\n\nOf the 102 patients, 14 (13.7%) developed ecchymosis. Blood transfusion and drainage catheter clamping during the first few postoperative hours had a significant impact on the development of ecchymosis (p\\xa0<\\xa00.05). There was no difference in age, BMI, operation time, pre- and postoperative platelet count, and length of postoperative anticoagulant therapy between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression revealed major risk factors for ecchymosis were postoperative blood transfusion (odds ratio (OR)\\xa0=\\xa015.624) and drainage catheter clamping (OR 14.237) (both, p\\xa0<\\xa00.05).",
        "Bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are critical for metastatic progression. This study explores the effect of tetrathiomolybdate (TM), an anti-angiogenic copper chelator, on EPCs in patients at high risk for breast cancer recurrence.\n\nThis phase 2 study enrolled breast cancer patients with stage 3 and stage 4 without evidence of disease (NED), and stage 2 if triple-negative. TM 100 mg orally was administered to maintain ceruloplasmin <17 mg/dl for 2 years or until relapse. The primary end point was change in EPCs.\n\nForty patients (28 stage 2/3, 12 stage 4 NED) were enrolled. Seventy-five percent patients achieved the copper depletion target by 1 month. Ninety-one percent of triple-negative patients copper-depleted compared with 41% luminal subtypes. In copper-depleted patients only, there was a significant reduction in EPCs/ml by 27 (P = 0.04). Six patients relapsed while on study, of which only one patient had EPCs maintained below baseline. The 10-month relapse-free survival was 85.0% (95% CI 74.6%-96.8%). Only grade 3/4 toxicity was hematologic: neutropenia (3.1% of cycles), febrile neutropenia (0.2%), and anemia (0.2%).",
        "Treatment for chronic hepatitis B has improved drastically with the use of nucleot(s)ide analogues (NAs). However, NA therapy typically fails to eliminate Hepatitis B virus (HBV) completely, and it is difficult to discontinue these therapies. We previously demonstrated that NA therapy induced immature viral particles, including HBV RNA in sera of chronic hepatitis B patients. In the study reported here, we analyzed the association between HBV RNA titer and the recurrence rate of hepatitis after discontinuation of NA therapy.\n\nThe study cohort comprised 36 patients who had discontinued NA therapy. Serum HBV DNA or DNA plus RNA levels were measured by real time PCR and statistical analyses were performed using clinical data and HBV markers.\n\nAt 24\\xa0weeks after discontinuation of NA therapy, HBV DNA rebound was observed in 19 of the 36 patients (52.8\\xa0%), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) rebound was observed in 12 of 36 patients (33.3\\xa0%). Multivariate statistical analysis was used to identify factors predictive of HBV DNA rebound. The HBV DNA\\xa0+\\xa0RNA titer following 3\\xa0months of treatment was significantly associated with HBV DNA rebound [P\\xa0=\\xa00.043, odds ratio (OR)\\xa09.474, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.069-83.957)].

In HBeAg-positive patients, the HBV DNA\\xa0+\\xa0RNA titer after 3\\xa0months of treatment was marginally associated with ALT rebound (P\\xa0=\\xa00.050, OR\\xa08.032, 95 % CI 0.997-64.683).",
        "Normal birth weight variation affects schizophrenia risk and cognitive performance in schizophrenia patients and healthy controls. Brain cortical anatomy is altered in psychotic disorders and in low birth weight subjects, but if birth weight variation relates to cortical morphology across the psychosis spectrum is not known.\n\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging brain scans and clinical-, neurocognitive-, and medical birth registry data were collected from 359 adults including patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia (n = 90, mean age 29.4\u00b110.2 [95% CI], 62% male), bipolar disorder (n = 79, age 29.4\u00b111.8, 39% male) or other psychosis (n = 40, age 26.3\u00b110.0, 56% male), and healthy controls (n = 140, age 30.8\u00b112.0,53% male). We explored the relationship between whole-range birth weight variation and cortical surface area and thickness and their possible associations to cognitive performance.\n\nAcross all groups, lower birth weight was associated with smaller total surface area (t = 3.87, P = .0001), within specific regions of the temporal, parietal, and frontal cortex bilaterally. There were no associations between birth weight and cortical thickness, and no diagnosis by birth weight interaction effects on cortical thickness or surface area. Smaller cortical area (t = 2.50, P = .013) and lower birth weight (t = 2.53, P = .012) were significantly related to poorer working memory performance in all diagnostic groups except schizophrenia.",
        "The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of RAS components and SIRTs enzymes in the adipose tissue of mice fed diets with different macronutrient composition.\n\nThe body weight, food intake, and energy intake (kcal) were evaluated. Blood parameters (insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, total cholesterol, HDL-C triglyceride, and glucose levels) were also assessed. Real-time PCR was performed in epididymal adipose tissue samples to analyze the expression of renin, angiotensinogen (AGT), angiotensin-converting enzyme 1 and 2 (ACE and ACE2), and SIRTs 1-7. Male FVB/N mice were divided into 5 groups (N = 10 each) that were fed with experimental diets for 60 days. Test diets were divided into standard (ST), AIN-93M, high glucose (HG), high protein (HP) and high lipid (HL).\n\nThe main results showed that HL diet treatment induced reduction in HDL-C and triglyceride plasma levels; increased ACE (Ang II marker) expression and decreased ACE2 (Ang-[1-7] catalyzer) expression in adipose tissue; and also increased SIRT4 expression.",

Here, we studied the potential beneficial effects of Ilex paraguariensis aqueous solution upon body composition, glycemia, lipid and hormonal profiles, leptin signaling and NPY content.\n\nTo induce early weaning, lactating rats\" teats were blocked with a bandage to interrupt lactation during the last 3 days (EW group), while control offspring had free access to milk throughout lactation (C group). In postnatal day (PN) 150, EW offspring were subdivided into: EW and EW+ mate groups treated, respectively, with water or yerba mate aqueous solution (1 g/kg BW/day, gavage) during 30 days. C offspring received water for gavage. In PN180, offspring were killed.\n\nEW+ mate group presented lower body weight (-10 %), adipose mass (retroperitoneal:-40 % and epididymal:-44 %), total body fat (-43 %), subcutaneous fat (-46 %), visceral adipocyte area (-21 %), triglyceridemia (-31 %) and hypothalamic NPY content (-37 %) compared to EW group. However, hyperglycemia and lower HDL-c levels observed in EW group were not reverted with mate treatment. Although the hyperleptinemia, lower hypothalamic JAK2 and pSTAT3 content of EW group were not corrected by mate treatment, the hyperphagia and higher hypothalamic SOCS-3 content were normalized in EW+ mate group, indicating that the central leptin resistance could be restored.",

        "Two signalling molecules that are attractive for targeted therapy are the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3). We investigated possible crosstalk between these 2 pathways, particularly in light of the recent evidence implicating PPAR\u03b3 for anticancer therapy.\n\nAs evaluated by MTT assays, gefitinib (EGFR inhibitor) and DIM-C (PPAR\u03b3 agonist) inhibited growth of 9 bladder cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner but with variable sensitivity. In addition, combination of gefitinib and DIM-C demonstrated maximal inhibition of cell proliferation compared to each drug alone. These findings were confirmed in vivo, where combination therapy maximally inhibited tumor growth in contrast to each treatment alone when compared to control (p<0.04). Induction of PPAR\u03b3 expression along with nuclear accumulation was observed in response to increasing concentrations of gefitinib via activation of the transcription factor CCAT/enhancer-binding protein-\u03b2 (CEBP-\u03b2). In these cell lines, DIM-C significantly sensitized bladder cancer cell lines that were resistant to EGFR inhibition in a schedule-specific manner.",
        "Heart and pulmonary involvement is a leading cause of systemic sclerosis (SSc)-related deaths. The six-minute walk test (6MWT) is a simple and reproducible test commonly used to evaluate exercise capacity. We tried to assess a potential relationship between exercise capacity assessed by 6MWT, echocardiographic parameters of right ventricular function and serum levels of endothelin-1 and NTproBNP.\n\nWe prospectively studied 111 consecutive patients (101F, 10M, age 54.2\u00b113.8 years) with diagnosed SSc (mean disease duration 9\u00b112.4 years) and a group of 21 age-matched subjects (18F, 3M, age 49.3\u00b110.5 years). In addition to routine evaluation, 6MWT and transthoracic echocardiography (Phillips iE 33) were performed. We also measured serum endothelin-1 (Human Endothelin-1 immunoassay R & D Systems) and NT-proBNP levels (Elecsys pro-BNP immunoassay; Roche Diagnostics).\n\nThe mean 6MWT distance was significantly shorter in the SSc group than in the controls (562.8\u00b160.3 vs. 514.7\u00b1102.5 m, p=0.03).

The objective was to investigate the longitudinal relationships between changes in health and lifestyle factors with changes in hormones of the reproductive endocrine axis in ageing men.\n\nA longitudinal survey of 2736 community-dwelling men aged 40-79 years at baseline recruited from eight centres across Europe. Follow-up assessment occurred mean (\u00b1S.D.) 4.4\u00b10.3 years later.\n\nPaired testosterone results were available for 2395 men. Mean (\u00b1S.D.) annualised hormone changes were as follows: testosterone -0.1\u00b10.95\\u200a nmol/l; free testosterone (FT) -3.83\u00b116.8 \\u200apmol/l; sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) 0.56\u00b12.5\\u200a nmol/l and LH 0.08\u00b10.57\\u200a U/l. Weight loss was associated with a proportional increase, and weight gain a proportional decrease, in testosterone and SHBG. FT showed a curvilinear relationship to weight change; only those who gained or lost \u226515% of weight showed a significant change (in the same direction as testosterone). Smoking cessation was associated with a greater decline in testosterone than being a non-smoker, which was unrelated to weight change. Changes in number of comorbid conditions or physical activity were not associated with significant alterations in hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT) axis function.",
        "The purpose of this study was to compare the results of hallux valgus surgery between feet fixed with Kirschner wires and those fixed with a plate and screws.\n\nBetween December 2008 and November 2009, 53 patients (62 feet) were treated with proximal chevron osteotomy and distal soft tissue procedure for symptomatic moderate to severe hallux valgus deformity. Thirty-four patients (41 feet) were stabilised with Kirschner wires (K-wire group) and 19 patients (21 feet) were stabilised with a locking plate (plate group). Clinical results were assessed using American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score. Radiographic parameters were compared between these groups. Recurrence rate at the last follow-up was compared between the K-wire and plate groups.\n\nMean AOFAS score was lower in the plate group, however, the difference between the groups was not statistically significant in AOFAS score at the last follow-up. Hallux valgus angle and intermetatarsal angle were significantly larger in the plate group at the last follow-up. Mean 1-2 metatarsal (MT) distance on immediately postoperative radiographs was significant larger in the plate group. Four (9.8 %) of the 41 feet in the K-wire group and 7 (33.3 %) of the 21 feet in the plate group showed hallux valgus recurrence at the last follow-up. The plate group had a significantly higher risk of recurrence than the K-wire group.",
        "Evidence accumulates that the neuropeptide oxytocin plays an important role in mediating social interaction among humans and that a dysfunction in oxytocin-modulated brain mechanisms might lie at the core of disturbed social behavior in neuropsychiatric disease. Explanatory models suggest that oxytocin guides social approach and avoidance by modulating the perceived salience of socially meaningful cues. Animal data point toward the ventral tegmental area (VTA) as the brain site where this modulation takes place.\n\nWe used functional magnetic resonance imaging and a social incentive delay task to test the hypothesis that oxytocin modulates the neural processing of socially relevant cues in the VTA, hereby facilitating behavioral response. Twenty-eight nulliparous women (not taking any hormones) received intranasal oxytocin or placebo in a double-blind randomized clinical trial with a parallel-group design.\n\nOxytocin significantly enhanced VTA activation in response to cues signaling social reward (friendly face) or social punishment (angry face). Oxytocin effects on behavioral performance were modulated by individual differences in sociability with enhanced performance in women scoring low but decreased performance in women scoring high on self-reported measures of agreeableness.",
        "While literature demonstrates that the optimum accuracy is obtained with the custom trays, the use of stock trays for elastomeric impressions appears to be popular in general practice. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of thickness of impression material on the dimensional accuracy of impressions made from monophasic polyvinylsiloxane impression material. This study also studies the dimensional stability of the impressions poured at different time intervals.\n\nA metal model simulating two abutment teeth was fabricated along with reference lines inscribed on them. Custom impression trays were fabricated with spacer thickness of 2, 4 and 6 mm. impressions were made using monophasic polyvinyl siloxane impression material. The impressions were poured and stone models were obtained. The dimensional accuracy of the impressions were determined indirectly by measuring the dimensional changes of the recovered stone models. The dimensional stability was also evaluated by pouring the impressions at time intervals of 1 hour, 24 hours and 7 days. The obtained data was statistically analyzed.\n\nThe results of the study indicated that the impressions made from 2 and 4 mm tray space produced more accurate stone models when compared to 6 mm tray space. There was no significant deviation in the mesiodistal and buccolingual dimensions when impressions were made using impression trays with 2, 4 and 6 mm tray spacers. There was a significant decrease in interabutment distance (p = 0.001) and height of the abutment (p = 0.024) when impressions were made using impression trays with a tray space of 6 mm. There were no significant differences found among the stone models obtained from 1 hour, 24 hours and 1 week pour times.",
        "\\u2002Periodontopathic bacteria are detected at a high rate in specimens obtained from the aortic walls of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and are involved in AAA development. The purpose of this study was to clarify the role of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which are key receptors of virulence factors of many periodontal bacteria, on periodontopathic bacteria-accelerated AAA progression.\n\n\\u2002AAA was produced by peri-aortic application of 0.25 mol/L CaCl2, with NaCl used as a control. The mice were inoculated with live Porphyromonas (P.) gingivalis or vehicle once weekly. At 4 weeks after the application of CaCl2, the aortic diameter of the P. gingivalis-infected wild-type mice showed a significant increase in comparison with vehicle control mice (P<0.05). The P. gingivalis-infected TLR-2 deficient mice showed no statistical increase in aortic diameter over the same period. The aortic diameter of the P. gingivalis-infected TLR-4 deficient mice statistically increased. Immunohistochemically, the levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 in the aneurysmal samples from wild-type mice were higher than in TLR-2 deficient mice.",
        "To assess the extent to which demographic characteristics are related to international medical graduate (IMG) candidate performance on the Centre for the Evaluation of Health Professionals Educated Abroad General Comprehensive Clinical Examination 1 (CE1).\n\nRetrospective study.\n\nToronto, Ont.\n\nAll IMG candidates who registered for and took the CE1 in 2007 (n = 430), 2008 (n = 480), and 2009 (n = 472) were included in this analysis. All candidates completed the Centre for the Evaluation of Health Professionals Educated Abroad CE1, a 12-station objective structured clinical examination.\n\nMean (SD) examination scores for groups based on demographic variables (age, region of medical training, and Medical Council of Canada Qualifying Examination Part 1 [MCCQE1] score) were calculated. Analysis of variance was done using CE1 examination total scores as the dependent variables.\n\nCandidates from countries where both medical education and patient care are conducted in English and those from South America and Western Europe achieved the highest scores, while candidates from the Western Pacific region and Africa achieved the lowest scores. Younger candidates achieved higher scores than older candidates. These results were consistent across the 3 years of CE1 examination administration. There was a significant relationship between MCCQE1 and CE1 scores in 2 of the 3 years: 2007 (r = 0.218, P < .001) and 2008 (r = 0.23, P < .01).",
        "This study aimed to investigate the association between serum adiponectin and chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.\n\nWe conducted a campus-based cross-sectional study in Northern Taiwan, an HBV-endemic country. A total of 506 participants, including 147 chronic HBV-infected individuals and 359 healthy controls, were assessed for anthropometric indices, serum adiponectin levels, serum HBV viral load and markers, serum alanine aminotransferase levels and metabolic factors.\n\nOlder age, male gender, higher alanine aminotransferase, higher body mass index, greater waist circumference, lower fasting glucose, higher triglycerides, and higher adiponectin were associated with chronic HBV infection in univariate analyses. In multivariate analysis, the presence of chronic HBV infection was positively associated with serum adiponectin levels (P < 0.0001) and high adiponectin levels over the 75th percentile (odds ratio, 4.25; 95% confidence interval, 2.36-7.66; P < 0.0001) after adjusting for age, gender, body mass index, and insulin resistance index. Furthermore, serum adiponectin levels were positively associated with HBV viral load in overweight to obese HBV-infected subjects (P = 0.018).",
        "Interaction between vascular wall abnormalities, inflammatory leukocytes, platelets, coagulation factors and hemorheology in the pathogenesis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is incompletely understood, requiring well defined animal models of human disease.\n\nWe subjected male C57BL/6 mice to ligation of the inferior vena cava (IVC) as a flow reduction model to induce DVT. Thrombus size and weight were analyzed macroscopically and sonographically by B-mode, pulse wave (pw) Doppler and power Doppler imaging (PDI) using high frequency ultrasound. Thrombus size varied substantially between individual procedures and mice, irrespective of the flow reduction achieved by the ligature. Interestingly, PDI accurately predicted thrombus size in a very robust fashion (r2 = 0.9734, p < 0.0001). Distance of the insertion of side branches from the ligature significantly determines thrombus weight (r2 = 0.5597, p < 0.0001) and length (r2 = 0.5441, p < 0.0001) in the IVC, regardless of the flow measured by pw-Doppler with distances <1.5 mm drastically impairing thrombus formation. Occlusion of side branches prior to ligation of IVC did not increase thrombus size, probably due to patent side branches inaccessible to surgery.",
        "Recent observations, especially in adults, suggest that asthma severity may be associated with fungal sensitization. Other studies suggest that some patients with severe asthma and fungal sensitization may benefit from anti-fungal therapy. Currently, the prevalence of fungal sensitization among children with severe asthma is not well characterized.\n\nWe determined prevalence of fungal sensitization among children with moderate to severe persistent asthma and compared clinical characteristics between sensitized and non-sensitized children, including asthma severity, serum immunoglobulin E, and pulmonary function.\n\nOf the 64 children enrolled, 25 (39%) had evidence of sensitization to one or more fungi. Nineteen of 25 (76%) children with fungal sensitization were categorized as severe persistent compared to 13 of 39 (33%) children without evidence of fungal sensitization (odds ratio = 6.33, 95% confidence interval 2.04-19.68, P = 0.0014). Of 32 severe persistent asthmatics, 19 (59%) demonstrated evidence of fungal sensitization. Serum immunoglobulin E was significantly higher (P < 0.001), and pulmonary function (including FEV1, FEV1/FVC, and FEF25-75%) significantly lower in the fungal-sensitized patients (P = 0.016, 0.0004, and 0.002, respectively). Bronchial biopsy of sensitized children revealed basement membrane thickening and eosinophil infiltration.",
        "The aim of the study was to investigate circulating markers of apoptosis in relation to infarct size, left ventricular dysfunction and remodeling in an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) population undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).\n\nImmediate re-opening of the acutely occluded infarct-related artery via primary PCI is the treatment of choice in STEMI to limit ischemia injury. However, the sudden re-initiation of blood flow can lead to a local acute inflammatory response with further endothelial and myocardial damage, so-called reperfusion injury. Apoptosis is suggested to be a key event in ischemia-reperfusion injury, resulting in LV-dysfunction, remodeling and heart failure.\n\nThe present study is a prespecified substudy of the F.I.R.E. trial. We included 48 patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI. Blood samples were collected prior to PCI and after 24 hours. Plasma was separated for later analysis of soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor (sTNFR) 1, sTNFR2, sFas and sFas ligand (sFasL) by ELISA. Infarct size, left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and remodeling were assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging at five days and four months after STEMI.\n\nThe levels of sTNFR1 at 24 h as well as the relative increases in sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 over 24 h showed consistent and significant correlations with infarct size and LV-dysfunction at four months. Moreover, both sTNFRs correlated strongly with Troponin I and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 measurements. Soluble Fas and sFasL did not overall correlate with measures of infarct size or LV-dysfunction. None of the apoptosis markers correlated significantly with measures of remodeling.",
        "The lack of accuracy of point of care (POC) glucose monitors has limited their use in the diagnosis of neonatal hypoglycemia. Hematocrit plays an important role in explaining discordant results. The objective of this study was to to assess the effect of hematocrit on the diagnostic performance of Abbott Precision Xceed Pro (PXP) and Nova StatStrip (StatStrip) monitors in neonates.\n\nAll blood samples ordered for laboratory glucose measurement were analyzed using the PXP and StatStrip and compared with the laboratory analyzer (ABL 800 Blood Gas analyzer [ABL]). Acceptable error targets were \u00b115% for glucose monitoring and \u00b15% for diagnosis.\n\nA total of 307 samples from 176 neonates were analyzed. Overall, 90% of StatStrip and 75% of PXP values met the 15% error limit and 45% of StatStrip and 32% of PXP values met the 5% error limit. At glucose concentrations \u22644 mmol/L, 83% of StatStrip and 79% of PXP values met the 15% error limit, while 37% of StatStrip and 38% of PXP values met the 5% error limit. Hematocrit explained 7.4% of the difference between the PXP and ABL whereas it accounted for only 0.09% of the difference between the StatStrip and ABL. The ROC analysis showed the screening cut point with the best performance for identifying neonatal hypoglycemia was 3.2 mmol/L for StatStrip and 3.3 mmol/L for PXP.",
        "Serum HER2 (S-HER2) was approved in 2003 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for monitoring trastuzumab treatment in tissue HER2 positive breast cancer patients. Information of the value of S-HER2 is scarce. We hypothesised that S-HER2 would reflect the clinical effect of trastuzumab.\n\nWe followed 48 patients eligible for trastuzumab treatment for up to 6 years or until death. S-HER2 was measured on an ADVIA Centaur System and S-Trastuzumab was measured by an in-house developed fluorescent enzyme immunoassay system on the ImmunoCap 100.\n\nA decrease in S-HER2 of \u2265 20% was correlated to no progression in the disease in 20 out of 21 clinical courses (p<0.0001). An increase in S-HER2 of \u2265 20% was correlated to progression in the disease in 40 out of 44 clinical courses (p<0.0001). Patients with no recurrence after trastuzumab treatment (n=18) had a median S-HER2 concentration of 10.5 \u03bcg/L, whereas patients alive with recurrence (n=13) had a median S-HER2 of 20.1 \u03bcg/L (p=0.002). Patients who died prompted by recurrence (n=17) had a median S-HER2 of 232.4 \u03bcg/L at latest measurement before death (p=<0.0001) compared to patients without recurrence. In two patients with S-HER2 values above 1000 \u03bcg/L the concentrations of S-trastuzumab were measured below the target trough concentration in serum of 10 mg/L.",
        "Methane (CH4)-producing intestinal bacteria might be related to constipation. This study was carried out to evaluate the association between breath CH4, colonic transit, and anorectal pressure in constipated patients.\n\nA database of consecutive 62 constipated patients fulfilling the Rome III with the lactulose CH4 breath test (LMBT), a colon marker study, and anorectal manometry was studied. The profile of LMBT in patients was compared with 49 healthy controls. The positivity to LMBT (LMBT+) was defined as CH4 of at least 10 ppm in baseline or above baseline within 90 min. There were two types of constipation: normal and delayed transit.\n\nThere were significant differences in the breath CH4 between patients with delayed transit and (a) normal transit from 0 to 135 min or (b) healthy controls from 0 to 180 min. The LMBT+ was higher in delayed transit patients than in healthy controls (58.8 vs.12.2%) or in normal transit patients (vs. 13.3%), respectively (P<0.01). The delayed transit was the only independent factor for LMBT+ [odds ratio (95% confidence interval), 27.8 (3.32-250.00), P<0.01]. The left and total colonic transit time were significantly increased in LMBT-positive than in LMBT-negative patients. Significant correlations were found between total CH4 and the time of left or total colonic transit. However, no difference was found in the parameters of manometry by LMBT status.",
        "Neonatal total parenteral nutrition (TPN) is associated with animals with low glucose tolerance, body weight, and physical activity at adulthood. The early life origin of adult metabolic perturbations suggests a reprogramming of metabolism following epigenetic modifications induced by a change in the pattern of DNA expression. We hypothesized that peroxides contaminating TPN inhibit the activity of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), leading to a modified DNA methylation state.\n\nThree groups of 3-d-old guinea pigs with catheters in their jugular veins were compared: (i) control: enterally fed with regular chow; (ii) TPN: fed exclusively with TPN (dextrose, amino acids, lipids, multivitamins, contaminated with 350 \u00b1 29 \u03bcmol/l peroxides); (iii) H2O2: control + 350 \u03bcmol/l H2O2 intravenously. After 4 d, infusions were stopped and animals enterally fed. Half the animals were killed immediately after treatments and half were killed 8 wk later (n = 4-6 per group) for hepatic determination of DNMT activities and of 5\"-methyl-2\"-deoxycytidine (5MedCyd) levels, a marker of DNA methylation.\n\nAt 1 wk, DNMT and 5MedCyd were lower in the TPN and H2O2 groups as compared with controls. At 9 wk, DNMT remained lower in the TPN group, whereas 5MedCyd was lower in the TPN and H2O2 groups.",
        "Wolbachia are maternally inherited endosymbiotic bacteria that manipulate the reproductive success of their insect hosts. Uninfected females that mate with Wolbachia infected males do not reproduce due to cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). CI results in the increased frequency of Wolbachia-infected individuals in populations. Recently, two Wolbachia strains, the benign wMel and virulent wMelPop have been artificially transinfected into the primary vector of dengue virus, the mosquito Ae. aegypti where they have formed stable infections. These Wolbachia infections are being developed for a biological control strategy against dengue virus transmission. While the effects of Wolbachia on female Ae. aegypti have been examined the effects on males are less well characterised. Here we ascertain and compare the effects of the two strains on male fitness in resource-limited environments that may better approximate the natural environment.\n\nA series of population mating trials were conducted to examine the effect of Wolbachia infection status (with strains wMel and wMelPop) and male larval nutrition on insemination frequency, remating rates, the fecundity of females, the hatch rates of eggs and the wing length and fertility of males.\n\nwMel and wMelPop infections reduce the fecundity of infected females and wMelPop reduces the viability of eggs. Low nutrition diets for males in the larval phase affects the fecundity of wMel-infected females. Neither strain of Wolbachia affected sperm quality or viability or the ability of males to successfully mate multiple females.",
        "Oxidative stress is considered a key element in the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Unconjugated bilirubin is the main endogenous lipid antioxidant and is cytoprotective in different tissues and organs. In this study, it was evaluated if unconjugated bilirubin levels are associated with the degree of liver injury in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\n\nTwo hundred and eighty-five patients were retrospectively evaluated with biopsy-confirmed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Multiple logistic regression models were used to assess the relationship of steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis levels to the features of patients.\n\nUnconjugated bilirubin levels differed significantly according to inflammation and fibrosis scores. Unconjugated bilirubin was lower in patients with moderate-severe inflammation compared with those with absent-mild (P\\u2009=\\u20090.001) and in patients with moderate-severe fibrosis compared with those with absent-mild (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001), whereas no difference was observed for steatosis grades. At logistic regression analysis, low unconjugated bilirubin levels were associated with moderate-severe inflammation (odds ratio, 0.11; 95% confidence interval 0.02-0.76; P\\u2009=\\u20090.025) and moderate-severe fibrosis (odds ratio, 0.013; 95% confidence interval 0.001-0.253; P\\u2009=\\u20090.004)."
